<p>It is not, however, necessary to give a detailed list of authorities,
which would be little more than a catalogue of the lives, letters, and
memoirs of most of the important men of the time. Of these the number is
constantly being augmented, and it is from them and the contemporary
tracts, monographs, pamphlets, and fugitive writings that the details of
the History must be drawn.</p>

<p><span class="first drop">B</span><span class="smcap">efore</span> the Crown was absolutely offered to William, the Convention
was eager to reform a number of the most prominent
abuses of the last reign. It was shown by the wiser leaders among
them that such reforms would entail a mass of legislation which,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_NINE_THE_DECLARATION" id="SIXTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_NINE_THE_DECLARATION"></a>The Declaration of Right.</span>
to be done well, must occupy several years. It was
therefore determined that, for the present, a solemn
declaration of principles only should be drawn up. This is known
as the Declaration of Right. In it, after enumerating the evils from
which the country had suffered, the Lords and Commons declared
that the dispensing power does not exist, that without grant or consent
of Parliament no money can be exacted by the sovereign, and
no army kept up in time of peace. They also affirmed the right of
petition, the right of free choice of representatives, the right of Parliament
<span class="sidenote">Crown accepted by William and Mary.</span>
to freedom of debate, the right of the nation to a pure administration
of justice, and the necessity, in order to secure these things,
of frequent Parliaments. This Declaration having been
read to William and Mary, the Crown was solemnly
offered them by Halifax, and by them accepted. They
were immediately proclaimed amid general plaudits.</p>

<p>Thus was consummated, with scarcely any bloodshed, and by what
<span class="sidenote">Character of the Revolution.</span>
appeared an almost unanimous action on the part of the
nation, a complete revolution. It was not the less a
revolution because it was held that the whole Constitution of England
passed on in its minutest detail unchanged. By it was overthrown
for ever the theory which came into existence under the Tudors, and
was brought to perfection under the Stuarts; henceforward it was
impossible that the King should be regarded either as the proprietor
of the country, or as a ruler by divine right, the representative of God
upon earth. In the place of this theory was substituted that great
Whig theory, which, arising among the Puritans, had enjoyed a brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
triumph in the successes of the Great Rebellion, and, violently overthrown
at the Restoration, had succeeded in making good its position
during the reigns of the two last Stuarts,&mdash;the theory which regarded
the King as reigning by the will of the people and in virtue of an
implied contract with them. As a natural consequence of the position
thus taken by the nation as the supreme power in the State, Parliament,
its representative, became in its turn supreme, and although
the change was not yet fully understood, the representatives of the
people were gradually taking to themselves not only the duties of
legislation, but also the executive. The ministry, therefore, however
much they may have been still regarded as the King's ministers,
became by degrees the national ministers, answerable for their
conduct in Parliament, and before long became in fact little else than
the executive Committee of the majority in Parliament.</p>

<p>The unanimity of parties which had secured the triumph of William
<span class="sidenote">Personal unpopularity of William.</span>
was of short duration, nor was his personal popularity long-lived.
The apparent coldness of his demeanour, his carelessness of the pomps
of the Court, his wretched health, which obliged him to withdraw from
London and establish his Court at Kensington, speedily rendered him
personally unpopular; while, as soon as the general danger which had
caused their union was removed, the fundamental differences which
divided political parties at once made themselves obvious. Moreover,
the tendency to reaction, visible after all political excitements,
began to show itself. Two classes were by no means ready to accept
kindly the revolution which had been wrought. These were the clergy
<span class="sidenote">Discontent of the clergy</span>
and the army. The greater part of the clergy had spent their lives in
inculcating the duty of passive obedience. Although that theory had
broken down in practice when the attacks of the Crown were directed
against themselves, they could not bring themselves to submit without
difficulty to a complete reversal of their political creed, nor could
they help seeing that the success of William implied nothing short of
the substitution of the Whig doctrine for that of monarchy by divine
right. A very large portion of them were therefore disaffected. The
<span class="sidenote">and the army.</span>
army, though it had disliked the introduction of Catholics and of Irish
among its ranks, and was not prejudiced in favour of any theory of
monarchy, felt its professional honour injured by the sorry part it
had played in the late events. So deep was the disaffection that one
regiment quartered at Ipswich broke out into open mutiny,
marched northward in arms, and was only brought to obedience after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
a skirmish with some Dutch troops under Ginkel, which had been
rapidly sent in pursuit. The signs of general disaffection at the
same time were so obvious that it was thought necessary to suspend
the Habeas Corpus Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Convention changed into a Parliament.</div>

<p>Before this happened, William had had to form a ministry and to
furnish himself with a Parliament. For this latter purpose, in spite
of the opposition of many of the old Tories, who regarded a Parliament
not summoned by the King's writ as no Parliament at all, the Convention
was changed into a Parliament, and proceeded to act in that capacity.
It was not indeed reasonable that a freely elected body, whose choice
of a king both sides were willing to allow, should still be regarded
upon technical grounds as incapable of settling matters of much less
importance. The choice of ministers was a matter of more difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's difficulties in forming a
ministry.</div>

<p>At the present time the choice of ministers is tolerably simple.
The House of Commons having obtained the position
of both legislature and executive, the administration is
placed in the hands of a Committee of that party which
is predominant in the Commons; the Crown, in fact, having but little
choice in the matter. This theory of government, which is a necessary
consequence of the Parliamentary triumph at the Revolution, was in
the years immediately succeeding that event not understood. The
notion of a king whose duties are rather ornamental than real had
scarcely entered men's minds. The King was still expected to have
the direction of the executive, to be, in fact, his own Prime Minister,
and to nominate as heads of departments such statesmen as he thought
<span class="sidenote">Ignorance of the constitutional change.</span>
best fitted for the employment, without exact regard to
their political views. The effect of this was to make
the King responsible for the Government; and though
the right of impeachment, as exercised in the case of Danby, rested
upon the supposition that ministers were responsible to Parliament,
the fact was not yet fully recognized. It was this responsibility of
the king which had produced the disasters of the Great Rebellion
and the late Revolution. The gradual substitution of Parliamentary
ministry, which should serve as an intermediate body between the
Commons and the Crown, and save the Crown from direct responsibility,
is the great constitutional change which was completed on the
accession of the Hanoverian house. Such a change becomes absolutely
necessary when Parliament has once secured a complete control
of the executive; otherwise it is plain that the acts or proposals
of the executive, constantly met by a hostile majority in Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
could never be brought to a completion. It also of necessity implies
a mutual responsibility among the ministers, who upon essential
points must all agree with the Parliamentary majority. These
necessary consequences of the triumph of the Whig theory of the
sovereignty of the people were little understood even by the best English
politicians; and William, able as he was as a foreign statesman, had
never a clear insight into the working of the English Constitution.
Nor was his character such as to fit him to occupy the place of an
ornamental king. Thus he both himself intended and was expected
by the nation to exercise a supreme influence in the Government, at
the same time that the newly won powers of the Parliament were
liable constantly to thwart his schemes. Besides the difficulty which
this general ignorance of constitutional principles caused, peculiar
difficulties, arising from the manner in which he had obtained the
Crown, beset William. He had been brought to the throne by the
<span class="sidenote">The Whigs' desire for vengeance.</span>
Whigs. By the Whigs he was expected to become a party leader. They
looked forward, under his guidance, to a triumphant revenge on the
party at whose hands they had suffered so much. On the other hand,
William's own wish was to hush the storm of faction, to become King
of the whole English nation, not of one party, and to be able to use
the resources of England for his great European measures; he therefore
had no intention of becoming a mere party leader. Again, his view of
the duties and responsibilities of a king was a high one, whereas the
Whigs, on whom he might be expected to rely, were pledged to give
greater prominence to the influence of Parliament. William's natural
tendencies, therefore, when once safeguards for a just Government and
personal liberty were secured, inclined him rather to the Tories, whose
view of the prerogative was higher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's ministry.</div>

<p>It was in the midst of these difficulties that William had to
select his ministry. He attempted to conciliate all parties, with the
exception of the extreme Jacobites, and his ministry was a mixed one.
Danby had been mainly instrumental in bringing William to England.
He had indeed in the Convention thrown some obstacles in the way of
the Parliamentary change of dynasty, but might fairly look for a high
reward. He was displeased at being appointed President of the Council,
a post of high honour, but not of great political activity. Halifax
was appointed Privy Seal. His intellect, which always saw two sides of
a question, was not such as to fit him for decided statesmanship. The
places of real importance, the Secretaryships, were shared between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
Tories and the Whigs; Nottingham, the leader of that class who
expressed with perfect honesty their willingness to acknowledge any
King <i>de facto</i>, and Shrewsbury, a young man of great ability and
as yet a consistent Whig, were appointed to those places. Neither
Treasury nor Admiralty were intrusted to any single individual, but
were placed in Commission, both Whigs and Tories sitting at the Boards.
At the Treasury, though only third on the Commission, Godolphin, by
his superior skill and knowledge, soon became pre-eminent. The purity
of the judgment-seat was secured by a careful selection of the ablest
lawyers from a list supplied by the Privy Council, while the great
places of the Household, where personal rather than political influence
was wanted, were chiefly given to William's personal friends from
Holland, the most prominent being Overkirk, Master of the Horse, and
Bentinck, subsequently Earl of Portland.</p>

<p>By the appointment of his ministers, and by the conversion of the
Convention into a Parliament, the apparatus of Government was complete.
<span class="sidenote">Settlement of the revenue.</span>
The Whigs were for a time triumphant. The revenue was settled on a
peace footing at £1,200,000 a year; the hereditary taxes being given
to William for the support of his Crown (a grant which forms the
origin of the Civil List), while the Parliamentary taxes intended for
the support of Government were granted only for limited periods. The
hearth tax, the most obnoxious and unjust of taxes, as it is at once
inquisitorial in its action and presses with undue severity upon the
poor in comparison with the rich, was abolished. The settlement of the
<span class="sidenote">Settlement of the Church.</span>
Church, and of the oaths to be taken by the holders of places, at once
rendered obvious the strength of faction which still existed, and the
difficulties which must beset all attempt at impartial government.
Three Bills were produced, a Toleration Bill, a Comprehension Bill,
for the purpose of so changing the construction of the Church and its
Liturgy as to admit numerous Protestant Dissenters, and a Bill for
the removal of the Test Act, for the purpose of enabling the King
to employ, as he was most desirous of doing, all Protestants in his
service. Of these three, one only, the Toleration Act, was carried. In
fact the Comprehension Bill, which was introduced by Nottingham, was
no doubt intended, after admitting a certain number of Dissenters, to
render the exclusion of the rest more absolute. Fear of this rendered
the Dissenters themselves hostile to it, and William's personal efforts
to produce at once comprehension and relaxation of the Test Act were in
vain; both Bills were thrown out.</p>

<p>There yet remained the question of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
It was acknowledged on all hands that all lay place-holders and all
<span class="sidenote">Oaths of allegiance and supremacy.</span>
newly-appointed holders of ecclesiastical preferments should be obliged
to take these oaths, slightly altered to suit existing circumstances.
The case of the clergy already holding benefices was not so clear. Many
were willing to accept the new Government peaceably, and it seemed
hard that they should be required to take oaths which gave the lie to
all their former political views. With regard to the Bishops too, the
High Church Party advanced the doctrine that the Episcopal ordination
was indelible, and that it was impossible for any Act either of King
or Parliament to prevent a man who had once been a Bishop from being
so always. Against the King's wish the party who were for the most
stringent application of the oaths carried the day. All the clergy
were required to take them by August 1689; if they had not been taken
by February 1690, those clergy and Bishops who refused them were to be
deprived. Between 300 and 400 refused the oath, and there thus sprang
up that section of the clergy known as Nonjurors. The settlement of
the country was completed by the Coronation Oath, which declared that
the King would uphold the Protestant religion as settled by law. It
was a foolish miscomprehension of these words, which obviously did
not prevent a Parliamentary change in the arrangements of religion,
which subsequently led George III. into his obstinate opposition to
Catholic emancipation. When the oath had been arranged, the coronation
took place (April 11), and some new titles were given; thus Danby
became Lord Caermarthen, Churchill Earl of Marlborough, Bentinck
Earl of Portland, and Mordaunt, First Lord of the Treasury, Earl of
Monmouth.</p>

<p>When the Government of the country was fairly settled it was time
for William to receive his reward. Parliament gratified him by a strong
declaration against the policy of Louis abroad, and assurance of hearty
support should he find it necessary to have recourse to arms. On the
<span class="sidenote">The European war breaks out.</span>
13th of May war with France was therefore declared. William stated that
he had no choice in the matter as France had already begun war upon
England. This was an allusion to the action of France in Ireland; for
Louis, though unable to trust James and his English and Irish friends
in that implicit manner which would have rendered his assistance
irresistible, was yet so far convinced that the real key to success
against the coalition was the neutralization of England, that he had
allowed James some assistance in troops. The other great countries of
the coalition had already declared war with France. Louis found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
with one ally only, who did him, if possible, more harm than
good,&mdash;this was the Porte. He succeeded in inducing that power
to continue its attacks upon Hungary, which was a constant source
of weakness to Austria; but the unnatural alliance between the most
Christian King and the great enemies of Christendom gave an opening
for the invective of his enemies, which received still further point
from his subsequent behaviour. Unable to sustain the forward position
which his armies had assumed in Germany the preceding year, especially
when some of his forces were required in Ireland, he ordered a retreat.
<span class="sidenote">Devastation of the Palatinate.</span>
What he could not keep he determined to destroy, and the Palatinate was
laid waste with a reckless, unsparing fury, which enabled each country,
as it declared war with him, to point out that his conduct was more
cruel than even that of his Turkish ally. It had such an effect on
the Continent, that war was declared at intervals of about a month by
Austria, the Empire, Spain, Brandenburg and Holland. William's primary
object was attained; Europe was combined against France. The resources
of England were placed in his hands to support that coalition, but
there was yet much to be done before he was free to act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of Ireland.</div>

<p>It has been already related that, on his flight, James stated his
intention of finding if possible a new centre of action in Ireland. The
view was a natural one, for he had throughout his reign been preparing
that island as a refuge in case of danger. He had there acted with
more freedom than was possible in England, and gone far to carry out
his plans for re-establishing Catholicism. Talbot, Lord Tyrconnel, a
perfectly unscrupulous man, was at the head of the Government. Almost
all the other important offices were in Romanist hands. Rice, chief
Baron of the Exchequer, made the law courts subserve the same policy;
he openly asserted his intention of assaulting the Act of Settlement;
all who had or thought they had claims against the actual possessors of
land, brought their claims into his court, and no proof was held too
weak, no witness too untrustworthy, for the purpose of re-establishing
the old Catholics in their possession of the soil. From private acts
he proceeded to public. Charter after charter was forfeited; municipal
corporations re-established, with reckless indifference to all forms of
right, on a Roman Catholic basis. While aldermen in the boroughs thus
became Roman Catholic, sheriffs of the same religion were appointed,
and in their hands lay the choice of juries, so that the whole legal
apparatus was directed against Protestantism. The army meanwhile had
been similarly reorganized; 6000 Protestant veterans had been disbanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
and their places occupied by vehement and disorderly Catholics, who
lived, we are told, constantly at free quarters on the Protestant
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The arrival of William in England had brought matters to a crisis.
The Papists thought their time was at length come. The whole country
<span class="sidenote">Panic among the Englishry.</span>
was full of panic and rumours of a coming massacre. Many of the English
fled. The gentry and yeomen gathered themselves together to the towns
and strong houses, to attempt if possible to make good for themselves
that security which the Government would not give them. The two most
important of these centres were Enniskillen and Londonderry. At the
former, early in 1689, the Protestant population refused admittance to
two companies of Popish infantry which had been ordered to be quartered
on them. The gentry collected, drove the soldiers away, appointed
Gustavus Hamilton governor, garrisoned the houses round Lough Erne, and
held the district for King William. At Londonderry the same process
took place. A regiment of 1200 Papists, under the Earl of Antrim, was
sent to the city, and the mayor and sheriffs, who by the new charters
were Papists, were proceeding to admit them, when thirteen young
apprentices of Scotch birth took upon themselves to close the gates,
<span class="sidenote">Londonderry and Enniskillen garrisoned.</span>
and the Protestant gentry were summoned from the neighbouring country
to defend the city. In two days it was strongly garrisoned, and the
troops withdrew. It was in vain that Lord Mountjoy, a Protestant, who
still remained faithful to James, attempted a compromise. Some few
troops under Lundy were indeed admitted, but the country was still
held for the Protestants, and Lundy was obliged, in appearance at all
events, to accept the new Government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile William had attempted to enter into negotiations with
<span class="sidenote">William's negotiation with Tyrconnel.</span>
Tyrconnel. For this purpose he had employed as his agent Richard
Hamilton, who had once held a commission in James's army, but who now
professed to have changed his allegiance. Hamilton pledged his word
that, if he failed in his commission, he would come back in three
weeks; but, forfeiting his promise, he returned to his old allegiance,
and became a chief leader on the side of James. But the character of
the quarrel was already changing, the real object of Tyrconnel, in
common with the greater part of the Irish Catholics, was to uphold
<span class="sidenote">Tyrconnel's object Irish independence.</span>
neither James nor William, but to destroy for ever the English
supremacy. For this purpose he was willing to use the name of James,
trusting in fact to the assistance of Louis, to whom he opened his real
design. He succeeded in ridding himself of Mountjoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
whose loyal influence was likely to thwart his plans, by sending him on
a mission to St. Germains, where James now held his Court, and where he
was at once apprehended. He then summoned the Irish to arms. An army
of 50,000 Papists was collected, and many thousands more took arms on
their own behalf, and ravaged the Protestant settlements around them.
To complete the Irish supremacy, Tyrconnel ordered the Protestants to
<span class="sidenote">His temporary success.</span>
be disarmed. The destruction wrought is inconceivable. Property which
has been estimated at £5,000,000 was destroyed. Whole herds of cattle
were killed and left to rot in the fields; 50,000 are said to have been
thus killed in six weeks, while about 400,000 sheep were similarly
slain. Unable to withstand this general movement, the Protestants in
the south and west were overpowered, or retreated if possible to the
strongholds of Londonderry and Enniskillen. In those two places the
flower of the English settlers stood at bay, surrounded on all sides by
hordes of liberated serfs now in mutiny against their former masters.
An army was ordered to march northwards under the traitor Richard
Hamilton. The Protestants fled before it; 30,000 of them collected as a
last asylum behind the walls of Londonderry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He gets James over.</div>

<p>The country was in this condition when James, in answer to the
messages which Tyrconnel had sent him, determined, with the assent of
Louis, and with considerable assistance in officers and arms, himself
to visit Ireland. He landed at Cork, and soon appeared in the capital,
while William, unable to act with energy on account of the difficulties
which surrounded him, was assailed by unthinking men with violent abuse
for not taking stronger measures to prevent those disasters which he
was really watching with the greatest dismay.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Dublin it was gradually brought home to James that
it was no feeling of passionate loyalty which was exciting the Irish
<span class="sidenote">Character of Irish Jacobites.</span>
population. Among those who attended his Court there were two distinct
factions. Some Englishmen, with the loyal feelings which animated
English Jacobites, were anxious to re-establish James and to retain the
English influence in Ireland. Another party, which included Tyrconnel
and almost all the Irish Papists, were fighting to destroy the English
supremacy, they cared not how, and intriguing to secure the assistance
of France. James would naturally have inclined to the former party, but
soon learnt that the power of his partisans was entirely gone.</p>

<p>He made a feeble struggle, and, contrary to the wish of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
and Irish, proceeded himself to the siege of Londonderry. On his
march he found that the Protestants, as they retired, had destroyed
all the crops and houses behind them. He journeyed through a desert,
<span class="sidenote">Siege of Londonderry.</span>
and when he found that the inhabitants of the city had got rid of
their treacherous governor Lundy, had taken matters into their own
hands, and appointed Walker, a clergyman, and Major Henry Baker, joint
governors, he determined to return instantly to Dublin, there to hold
a Parliament. The prosecution of the siege was intrusted to a French
general, Maumont, and Richard Hamilton. The defence was so vigorous
that the siege was soon turned into a blockade; and while the gallant
city was holding out to the last extremity, the Parliament at Dublin
met.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, considering the circumstances under which it
was collected, it consisted entirely of Catholics. It proceeded to act
<span class="sidenote">Wild legislation of the Irish Parliament.</span>
with a recklessness which might be expected from an enslaved nation
suddenly called to power, and from men who for years had been unused
to public life. The great Act of Settlement, that compromise which
in Charles II.'s reign had settled the share of land to be held by
the Protestant emigrants who had followed Cromwell's victorious arms,
was repealed. Many thousands of square miles were at a single blow
transferred from English to Celtic landlords. The Act itself may have
been unjust, but for years it had been the basis of society, and men
had acted as though their titles were secure. Its repeal was therefore
a violent act of unjust confiscation. Moreover, as far as James was
concerned, nothing could be more disastrous, nothing could more surely
destroy any influence he might yet keep in England, where it seemed to
foreshadow the justice Protestants might expect from his hands were
his reign re-established. Such slight opposition as James offered (for
he had the wisdom to see some of the disastrous consequences of the
measure) had no effect but to cause profound distrust of himself. Other
legislation even more disastrous met with no opposition at his hands.
In his want of money he issued false coinage of copper and brass,
intrinsically worth perhaps a sixtieth of its nominal value. Thus of
course all creditors and mortgagees, who were pretty certain to be
Protestants, were ruined. The money was rendered current by threats
of punishment against those who refused it. Prices were kept down by
law; and to complete this wild legislation, the great Act of Attainder
was passed, containing between 2000 or 3000 names. No inquiry was
instituted as to the grounds of accusation against those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
who were attainted, and opportunities were thus afforded for any
man who had a personal enemy to introduce his name in the Bill.
A limit of time was set within which all those named were bound to
surrender themselves to justice or be liable to execution without
trial; while, to prevent the King's mercy from interfering with their
vengeance, the Commons passed a law that after November the right
of pardon should cease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its effect on English Jacobites.</div>

<p>Such legislation, sanctioned by James, while it failed to give him
real popularity in Ireland, checked the reaction which was beginning
in England. The feeling there grew constantly stronger against the
inaction of the Government. The fate of Londonderry and Enniskillen
were watched with absorbing interest. A fleet, with some troops under
command of Kirke, was at length despatched, but Kirke refused to risk
the passage of the river which led from Lough Foyle, and which was now
guarded by forts and a boom, and the starving population of Londonderry
had the misery of watching the ships as they lay idly in the Lough.
But they still held out with astonishing constancy. Their friends in
Enniskillen fared somewhat better. They did not confine themselves
to defence; but, issuing from the little island in Lough Erne which
surrounded their city, they collected from their enemies a considerable
quantity of cattle and ammunition, and lived in comparative comfort and
security. At length, in July, the fate of Londonderry seemed sealed.
Nearly everything eatable had been devoured,&mdash;horse-flesh, rats,
salt hides, all that could possibly be converted even into the most
objectionable food. It seemed impossible to feed the population in any
way for two days longer. At last a peremptory order reached Kirke to
<span class="sidenote">Londonderry saved.</span> relieve the city at
all hazards. On the 30th of July, three vessels, two transports and a
frigate, sailed up the river, and, after a few minutes of difficulty,
broke the boom, and in the evening, at ten o'clock, were anchored at
the quay. The city was saved after 105 days of siege and blockade.</p>

<p>The Irish army immediately broke up from its camp and retreated.
As it reached Strabane, on its backward course, it received the news
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Newton Butler.</span>
of another disaster. A great effort had been determined on against
Enniskillen, but Colonel Wolseley had been sent to take the command by
Kirke, and was successful in defeating at Newton Butler the approaching
Irish, of whom nearly 2000 were put to the sword or drowned in a
neighbouring lough. The news of this defeat hastened the steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
retreating army as it returned from Londonderry, and it fled in
confusion to Charlemont.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Violent character of the Revolution in
Scotland.</div>

<p>The same week which saw the relief of Londonderry and the battle of
Newton Butler was remarkable also for the great defeat of William's
army at Killiecrankie. In accordance with the character of the Scotch
people, and in some proportion to the cruelty which had been exercised
upon them, the Revolution in Scotland took a more violent form than
it had assumed in England, for in the North James had been able to
carry out more completely those plans which had produced his fall in
the southern kingdom. A Church repugnant to the majority of the people
had been forced upon them by law; in defiance of the opposition of
a subservient Parliament, all the high places had been filled with
Papists; nonconformity had been punished with an arbitrary severity
and a ferocious cruelty of which England showed no counterpart; the
electoral laws also, by requiring from all electors abjuration of the
Covenant and an assertion of the King's ecclesiastical supremacy,
excluded all but Prelatists from the right of election. Before
collecting a national Convention, to consider the state of the nation
under the present circumstances, it was necessary to dispense with the
Act which excluded Presbyterians from the franchise. The Convention
consequently consisted almost exclusively of Whigs, and the change
of Government was marked by grave disorders in many parts of the
country; nor, though William disliked these excesses, was he able to
repress them, and the Episcopal clergy were in many instances most
<span class="sidenote">Opposition to a union.</span>
roughly used. There was at first some talk of a union with England,
for the national feeling of the Scotch was beginning to yield to the
increasing belief that in most points, especially of a financial and
commercial character, such a union was very desirable; while many even
of the Whigs in England wished for a union of the Churches and the
establishment of Episcopacy on some broad and general basis. But the
religious feeling of the country was quite averse to such a course, and
William was too tolerant a man to wish to apply any coercion to men's
consciences. He therefore wrote a letter, in which he did little else
than profess his attachment to Protestantism, and his wish if possible
to establish the Union. The arrangements he left in their own hands.</p>

<p>Unable himself to be present in Scotland, he intrusted the business
to the two Dalrymples, father and son, and to Lord Melville, a prudent
man, who, though he had retired abroad during the storm which
succeeded the Rye-House Plot, had never committed himself warmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
to either party. James's agents were Graham of Claverhouse, now Earl
of Dundee, and Lindsay, Earl of Balcarras. The Castle of Edinburgh,
was in the hands of Gordon, a Jacobite; and James's agents hoped that,
by their own vigour and by means of the dread inspired by the castle
which commanded the town, they might yet obtain a predominant influence
in the Convention. The first trial of strength was the election of
a President, and before long it became evident that the Whigs would
certainly have the upper hand. They elected the Duke of Hamilton, and
about the middle of March the regular sittings of the Convention began.
<span class="sidenote">Letters from James and William.</span>
At the first meeting, letters from both King James and King William
were produced; that of James, the production of Melfort, was fitted,
like most of the productions of that statesman, to injure his master's
cause as much as possible. There was no word of repentance, no word
of conciliation; every line breathed an obstinate determination to
continue in the old course, and threats of vengeance on his enemies.
Dundee and Balcarras felt that all hope of maintaining a majority
was lost, and having thus failed in their first object, determined
<span class="sidenote">Dundee tries to secede.</span>
to pursue, in accordance with a plan they had already arranged, a
second line of policy, to secede with their adherents to Stirling,
and there establish a rival Convention. The movement was thwarted by
the premature retreat of Dundee. Edinburgh was full of fierce Western
Cameronians, and feeling that his life was endangered, he hastily
withdrew. The news that, with a party of his old troopers, he had set
out for Stirling, holding on his way a conference with the Governor of
<span class="sidenote">Edinburgh arms.</span>
Edinburgh Castle, excited the fears and hatred of the Presbyterians
in the Convention. They at once proceeded to rouse the people of
Edinburgh to arms, and to place the town in an attitude of defence, and
thus thwart the idea of secession. They then went on to consider the
state of the nation, and declaring that the late King had forfeited
the throne by misconduct, offered the Crown to William and Mary. The
offer was accompanied, as in the case of England, with a Declaration
of Right,&mdash;here in Scotland called the Claim of Right,&mdash;in
which, without discussing the question, they declared that Episcopacy
was abolished. The Crown was then solemnly offered and accepted.</p>

<p>Yet the difficulties of William were still most severe. The bigoted
Covenanters held aloof from a tolerant King who had not taken
the Covenant; and a number of extreme Whigs, who were attached
to a monarchy so limited as to be really a republic, put themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
at the head of a factious opposition, forming among themselves an
<span class="sidenote">The Club.</span> organization known by the name
of the Club. While this powerful opposition was being formed in the
Lowlands, war in behalf of the fugitive King actually broke out in the
Highlands. Dundee, on his flight from Edinburgh, had remained for some
time peaceably in his own house. But letters passing between him and
Melfort, James's minister in Ireland, were intercepted. An order
<span class="sidenote">Dundee escapes.</span> was issued to arrest him,
with his colleague Balcarras. Balcarras was secured, but Dundee fled
towards Inverness, where he found a state of affairs which he was able
to turn to the advantage of James.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Highland politics.</div>

<p>The politics of the Highland clans bore little relation to the
general politics of the nation. The Highlanders were as yet a half
savage race, devoted to their patriarchal form of society, and with
political attachments which seldom went beyond the head of their tribe.
It mattered but little to them whether James or William were upon
the Scottish throne. They were equally ready to oppose by violence
any Government which interfered with their wild freedom. But among
themselves they had bitter tribal jealousies and feuds, and the partial
introduction of the feudal system had complicated their relations
one with the other. Great chiefs, combining the character of feudal
lords and clan patriarchs, had contrived to extend their power, and
render other clans besides their own dependent or tributary. The Earl
or Marquis of Argyle, Mac Callum More, as the Highlanders called him,
head of the great clan of Campbell in Argyleshire, had thus extended
his pre-eminence at the expense of his neighbours. The power of this
chief was great. He could bring 5000 men into the field, and his
jurisdiction was so independent as to be hardly second to that of the
Crown; consequently all his neighbours looked upon him with jealousy
and hatred. That the politics of the head of the Campbell clan were
consistently Whig was enough to make all his rivals and enemies
Jacobites. But of late years the power of the Campbells had decayed;
during the triumph of the Stuart Kings the Marquis of Argyle had been
beheaded, and the Earl, his son, had been driven into exile. As the
Campbells sunk, the Macdonalds, the chief rivals of their clan, on
whose property they had encroached, had risen. But the Macdonalds had a
constant feud with the Mackintoshes in the neighbourhood of Inverness,
in pursuance of which Macdonald of Keppoch was at this moment engaged
in the siege of Inverness, which had made common cause with the
Mackintoshes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dundee in the Highlands.</div>

<p>When therefore Dundee came into that neighbourhood he found the
clans already in arms on quarrels of their own. It occurred to him
that, by taking advantage of the general enmity against the Campbells,
he might form a union of the clans, nominally at all events in favour
of King James. His plan met with a partial success. He could not indeed
induce the Mackintoshes to join with the Macdonalds, but he secured
their neutrality. The eastern clans as a rule followed the same course;
but those of the west, more immediate sufferers from the power and
encroachments of the Campbells, eagerly leapt at the opportunity of
attacking the party of which Argyle was one of the chiefs. Mackay
was sent to take the command of the English troops. With his regular
soldiers he could do nothing against the rapid Highlanders in the
mountains, and urged the plan, subsequently followed, of building a
line of forts across the country. The campaign produced no event of
importance. A cessation of arms occurred in June, spent by Dundee in
obtaining succour from James in Ireland, by Mackay in raising troops
with some difficulty among the Western Cameronians.</p>

<p>A fresh dispute among the clans renewed the war. The Murrays, of
whom Athol was the chief, had not as yet declared for either side. The
Marquis of Athol himself withdrew for safety to England, but his eldest
son declared for King William, while his steward, who was believed to
be in his confidence, declared for James. The two sections of the clan
disputed the possession of the castle of Blair Athol, the seat of the
chief. It was felt by both parties that the adhesion of this large
clan was of great importance, and Dundee on one side and Mackay on the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Killiecrankie. July 27.</span>
other hurried to support their friends at Blair Athol. The castle lies
a little beyond the northern end of the pass of Killiecrankie, a ravine
through which the river Garry rushes, and which leads from the lowlands
of Perthshire to the mountains. The armies were not ill-matched in
numbers. Mackay's troops were suffered by the Highlanders to get clear
of the difficult pass, and then found themselves in a little valley,
with the Highlanders occupying the hills around. As long as it was an
affair of musketry, the Lowland troops, many of whom were veterans,
held their ground, but when the clans suddenly threw their firelocks
from them and rushed with a wild yell on their lines, they broke and
fled, with the exception of one regiment, and rushed in helpless flight
down the narrow pass. It was the difference in the weapons which caused
this strange victory of undisciplined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
over disciplined troops. When he had fired his volley, the Highlander
threw away his firelock, and was ready in an instant to rush forward
with his broadsword. The bayonet at that time in use was so constructed
that, when fixed, it filled up the mouth of the barrel. It took
some minutes to arrange the clumsy contrivance which turned the
musket into a pike. While the regulars were still fumbling with their
weapons, the Highlanders were upon them.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mackay brought off
such troops as were left with rare coolness, and the death of Dundee
neutralized the effects of the defeat. The Highland army passed
under the command of General Cannon, who had brought over the Irish
auxiliaries, a man of no particular ability. Mackay succeeded in
<span class="sidenote">Mackay concludes the war.</span>
rapidly re-establishing his army. He destroyed the prestige of the
Highlanders by defeating a detachment at St. Johnstone's, near Perth;
and when a newly raised regiment of Cameronian recruits beat off
the mountaineers at Dunkeld, no longer held together by a leader of
ability, they broke up and retired to their own glens, and the war was
practically over.</p>

<p>Though William's measures had thus been tolerably successful,
although the Revolution was acknowledged in two portions of the Empire,
<span class="sidenote">Factions of the English Parliament.</span>
and likely soon to become so in the third, his position in London was
most difficult and trying. Success had dissolved the union between
the Whigs and Tories, and the triumphant Whigs had time to remember
their sufferings in the last reign and to form plans of vengeance.
The King desired above all things the cessation of faction and the
union of parties, but on every question which arose the Commons
displayed a most passionate temper. A certain number of attainders
were reversed, and this was well enough; but when a Bill of Indemnity
<span class="sidenote">Bill of Indemnity dropped.</span>
was brought in, so many exceptions were made to it, that it became in
fact rather a Bill of vengeance than a Bill of oblivion. The discussion
of these exceptions lasted so long that the Bill had to be dropped
for that session. But the intemperate Whig leaders, such men as Howe,
Sacheverell, and the younger Hampden, were not contented to be thus
balked of their revenge. Fierce attacks were brought against the Lord
<span class="sidenote">Attack on Halifax.</span> President Caermarthen,
and Halifax, the Privy Seal. The position of Caermarthen was so strong
that his enemies were afraid to divide the House against him. Halifax
had made more enemies, and was not so firmly supported by the King's
influence. The practical mind of William found little to like in the
subtle and questioning intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span>
of Halifax; and as the affairs in Ireland had been virtually entirely
in that nobleman's control, the wretched condition of the Protestants,
the lengthened misery of Londonderry, and the temporary success of
James and Tyrconnel, were all laid to his charge. It was said that
he even purposely neglected Ireland in order to render a new Government
indispensable. However, he contrived to escape impeachment
by a narrow majority of sixteen; and the relief of Londonderry, and
the immediate despatch of Schomberg at the head of a considerable
body of troops to support the Protestant interest, tended to check the
vehemence of the popular anger which was directed against him.</p>

<p>Late in August, the Parliament broke up till October, and all
eyes were turned towards the fate of Schomberg's expedition. His
troops consisted for the most part of raw recruits, scarcely able to
discharge their firelocks. He could not venture to fight with such an
army, but displayed great skill and determination in the manner in
<span class="sidenote"> Misery of the English army in Ireland.</span>
which he overcame overwhelming difficulties; for, while encamped in
the neighbourhood of Dundalk, treason was discovered in the camp of
some French Protestant refugees, some regiments of which accompanied
him. The refugees themselves were trustworthy, but a certain number
of other foreigners had found their way into their regiments, and
opened correspondence with the Irish. Sharp vengeance fell upon the
chief conspirators. But a more terrible enemy than treason attacked
the English troops. A deadly pestilence arose and carried them off
by hundreds: their misery was unspeakable; the ties of morality and
decorum were relaxed, the men got drunk sitting on the corpses of their
dead comrades, and the horror of the time is well shown by the fact,
that several ships lay in Carrickfergus Bay filled with carcases, and
not a live man on board. The blame of the wretched condition of the
army was traceable to the general maladministration which existed
in the Government. The Chief Commissary was a man named Shales, who
supplied the army with quite uneatable food, drew money largely for
supplies which never reached the troops, and let out the troop horses,
when collected, to English farmers. But it was not only in the army
that this maladministration was visible. Admiral Herbert, now Lord
Torrington, sunk in debauchery, allowed the same offences to be
perpetrated in the navy. It would be unfair to lay this to the charge
of William. The deeprooted mismanagement of the last twenty years
rendered it almost impossible for him to introduce reforms with any
rapidity, nor, with all the weight of foreign affairs on his hands,
could he personally supervise every department. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
own department was well and successfully managed, and the English
troops abroad won some honour in a skirmish against the French at
Walcourt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament meets. Oct. 19, 1689.</div>

<p>Still it was not to be expected that Parliament, on its
reassembling, should be in a better temper than when it separated. It
again renewed its violent courses. The necessary supplies were indeed
voted; The Bill of Rights, by which the Declaration of Right was to be
formed into a statute, and which in the last session had been thrown
aside because the Lords wished to introduce the name of the Electress
Sophia in the succession to the throne, was passed without that
amendment; but besides this scarcely any other work was done. On the
other hand, the Whig majority proceeded on their course of vengeance.
<span class="sidenote">The violence of the Whigs.</span>
The Earls of Salisbury and Peterborough, Sir Edward Hales and Obadiah
Walker were impeached; a Committee to inquire into the death of Russell
and Sidney, known as the Murder Committee, was appointed, and the
attack upon Halifax renewed. At length the Whigs, conscious that the
King was not well pleased with their vindictive temper, attempted to
secure their own permanent supremacy in Parliament. They introduced
a Corporation Bill, for restoring all the charters which had been
forfeited in the reign of James; and to this, at the suggestion of
Sacheverell and Howard, were appended two clauses, the one providing
that all who had taken part in the surrender of the charters should
be incapable of holding office for seven years, the other adding that
all who, in spite of being thus incapacitated, presumed to hold office
should be fined £500, and be debarred for life from public employment.
These clauses, which would have in fact disfranchized the Tory party
in every borough, they attempted to pass through the House by a
surprise, when the greater part of the Tory party had returned home for
<span class="sidenote">The Tories throw out the Corporation Act.</span>
Christmas. But so violent and factious a measure called out all the
energies of the Opposition. The country gentlemen came crowding back to
town, and, after a violent debate, the Whigs were defeated by a small
majority. The Tories thought to improve their triumph by reintroducing
the Bill of Indemnity without the exceptions, but they quite overrated
their strength. Their attempt was defeated by an enormous majority,
and a Bill of Pains and Penalties incorporated with the Indemnity Act,
which rendered it a mere measure of proscription. But this violent
measure was not destined to pass the House. The fierce struggle
of parties was so repugnant to the King, any attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
at firm national government appeared to him so hopeless, that, having
<span class="sidenote">William threatens to leave England.</span>
secretly arranged means of retiring to Holland, he sent for his
ministers, and told them it was his intention to withdraw from England,
leaving the Queen upon the throne. The threat stupefied the Whigs.
To whatever excesses their passion may have led them, they felt that
their safety was bound up with the prudent chief they had elected. A
passionate scene ensued, in which the Tory Nottingham and the Whig
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETY_WILLIAM_DISOLVES_PARLIAMENT" id="SIXTEEN_NINETY_WILLIAM_DISOLVES_PARLIAMENT"></a>Dissolves Parliament, Jan. 27, 1690, and
undertakes Irish war.</span> Shrewsbury vied with each other in
intreating William to forego his plan. At length he yielded, but
determined that he would escape from the atmosphere of faction which
surrounded him, and himself go to carry on the war in Ireland. Having
stated that such was his unalterable intention, he prorogued and
dissolved the factious Parliament which he had been unable to bring to
reason.</p>

<p>The dissolution brought with it a reaction. The Tories in the New
<span class="sidenote">Tory reaction in new Parliament.</span>
Parliament were as strong as the Whigs had lately been. Even London
returned four opponents to the obnoxious clauses of the Corporation
Act. As yet the theory of a ministry not having been established,
there was no great change, yet the balance among the ministers was
somewhat altered. Halifax withdrew from the Government; the Board of
Treasury and the Board of Admiralty were both reconstituted, with a
larger proportion of Tories, and Caermarthen attained such an amount
of power as to make him virtually Prime Minister. Sir John Lowther
<span class="sidenote">Venality of Parliament.</span> was put at
the head of the Treasury, while the purchase of votes, an art at
which Caermarthen was an adept, and which for many years to come
was constantly employed by the Government, was intrusted to Sir
John Trevor, who became Speaker. William had hitherto tried to act
without bribery; he had found his efforts futile, and his influence in
Parliament neutralized by the passion of faction. He now, against his
own feelings, allowed Caermarthen to have his way. The strange venality
of Parliament at this time, and for many years afterwards, may probably
be traced to the fact that the secrecy with which debates in Parliament
were shrouded prevented the exercise of any wholesome popular opinion
upon the vote of the representatives, while the Crown had lost that
power of coercing the Opposition which it had enjoyed in the time of
the Tudors. It became necessary to purchase what could not be procured
by violence, while there was no pressure from without to restrain the
cupidity of unprincipled members. With his new Parliament William found
himself more free to act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The revenue settled.</div>

<p>Its first duty was the settlement of the revenue. This had hitherto
been chiefly collected under Acts passed for short terms only. It was
now put on a permanent basis. The hereditary revenues, consisting
of the rents of royal domains, fees and fines, post office and
ecclesiastical dues, together with that portion of the excise which
had been paid to Charles II. as the price for the abolition of feudal
services, were given to William and Mary. These revenues amounted to
about £400,000 or £500,000 a year. The King had hoped to obtain a grant
for life of the other excise and custom duties which had been granted
to James, and had amounted to £900,000 a year; but the Tory majority
felt as distinctly as their opponents that an income which set the
Crown free from the necessity of consulting Parliament might prove a
source of evils similar to those of the last reign. They therefore gave
William for life only £300,000 a year from the excise, the remaining
£600,000, which arose from customs, they granted for four years
only.</p>

<p>On other points the Parliament now acted more in accordance with
the King's wishes, although the Whigs produced several embarrassing
measures, and attempted to compel all place-holders to take an oath
abjuring King James. But William was determined to check the
course of vengeance; the known wish of the King enabled the Tories
to throw out the obnoxious measure, and the revenge of the Whigs
<span class="sidenote">Act of Grace, May 20.</span> was finally
balked by an Act of Grace from the Crown, which took the place of the
unfinished Bill of Indemnity. This declared a perfect oblivion for
all political offences up to that moment, excepting from the benefits
of the Act only such of the regicides as were still alive, and about
thirty others; of whom some were either dead or in safety abroad, while
the rest, though in England, were suffered to live unharmed. It is a
noble addition to the glory of William that, through his firmness and
generosity, no blood was shed at the Great Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparation for war.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the King had been hastening preparations for his war.
The number of the troops in Ireland had been raised to 30,000, at
length well armed and well provisioned; a fleet, with still more
provisions and equipments, was ready to receive the King at Chester.
But at that moment it became very difficult for him to leave the
<span class="sidenote">Jacobite plot discovered.</span> country, for the
Jacobites had determined to seize the opportunity of his absence for a
great effort. Clarendon the Queen's uncle, Dartmouth commander of the
fleet which should have opposed William's landing, and Preston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
James's last Secretary of State, were the leaders of the scheme.
Fortunately their secrets were intrusted to a man named Fuller, who
at once determined to turn traitor. He gave over to the Privy Council
the despatches from the Queen in France, which had been sewn into his
buttons. His fellow-messenger was apprehended; when convicted and
condemned to death, he too confessed, and the chiefs of the conspiracy
were in the hands of the Government. Nevertheless it was a terrible
time to be absent from home. An insurrection might break out at any
moment, and an invasion was threatened from France.</p>

<p>William was determined that, come what would, he would put an end to
the disgraceful state of affairs in Ireland. He placed the Government
in the hands of the Queen, assisted by a Council of nine, with Danby
<span class="sidenote">William goes to Ireland.</span>
for her chief minister, Admiral Russell to advise her on naval,
and Marlborough on military affairs, and then crossed to Belfast.
Fortunately the two objects of the Jacobites proved incompatible;
the threatened invasion so roused the national spirit, that domestic
insurrection became impossible. While William advanced southward,
<span class="sidenote">Threatened invasion and insurrection.</span>
and the Irish army, reinforced by a considerable number of French
under Lauzun, fell back behind the Boyne, a great French fleet under
Tourville appeared off the Needles. Torrington, the English commander,
had been reinforced by a Dutch squadron, yet shrunk from the encounter,
and retreated towards the Straits of Dover. The Queen and her Council
sent peremptory orders to fight. Jealous of Russell, afraid of risking
a great battle with superior numbers, Torrington unwillingly obeyed.
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Beachy Head.</span>
With shameful policy, he sent the Dutch squadron forward to bear the
brunt of the danger, and left it almost unsupported, till, after
exhibiting their usual stubborn bravery, the Dutch were compelled to
fall back with their shattered ships, and Tourville swept the Channel
unopposed. Almost at the same time as the news of this disgraceful
defeat reached London, tidings arrived that the allies, under the
Prince of Waldeck, had been beaten by Luxemburg at the battle of
<span class="sidenote">Spirited behaviour of England.</span>
Fleurus. But the very misfortunes which seemed falling upon the nation
roused its spirit. The Lord Mayor offered the Queen at once £100,000,
10,000 Londoners, well armed for immediate purposes, and six regiments
of foot and two regiments of horse, to be raised at once, without cost
to the Crown. The same temper was visible throughout England, and
suddenly, after three days of depression, hope was again raised in the
national mind by the news of the battle of the Boyne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span></p>

<p>James had determined to make a stand behind that river, which separates
the counties of Louth and Meath, falling into the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of the Boyne. July 1, 1690.</span>
sea at Drogheda. The position was a fairly strong one; the ground rose
immediately from the river, and some of William's generals scarcely
liked to venture upon an attack. But he felt that some great blow was
necessary to retrieve the disasters of the last year, and he gave
orders for crossing the river at once. Early in the morning of the 1st
of July the English began to advance. Young Schomberg was sent some
miles up the river, to cross at the bridge of Slane, and thus turn the
left flank of the Irish army. His success in this movement alarmed
Lauzun. There was a narrow passage at Duleek, four miles south of the
Boyne, where two carriages could scarcely pass between impassable
bogs. If Schomberg could secure this pass the Irish would be enclosed
in a trap. It was necessary at any price to avoid this danger; Lauzun
therefore marched to oppose him, taking with him all the French troops,
leaving the Irish alone to hold the river. William commanded the left
wing, formed entirely of horse. He fought his way across the river
not far above Drogheda. In the centre Schomberg led the main body of
the infantry across the fords of Old Bridge. The Irish infantry which
should have opposed him, thoroughly demoralized by a year spent under
lax discipline and in habits of plunder, fled at the first onset. The
cavalry, who had been more carefully drilled under command of the
traitor Richard Hamilton, strove in vain to restore the day. For half
an hour the struggle in the bed of the river was fierce. The leader
of the Protestant refugees was killed, and Schomberg himself, while
rallying these troops, and calling out to them, "Come on, gentlemen,
there are your persecutors," also fell. But William, having crossed
with the left wing, now came up on the flank of the Irish, and the
passage was secured. The Irish cavalry were left entirely unsupported
by the infantry. Fighting bravely, and with considerable loss, they
were slowly driven from the ground. Their leader Richard Hamilton was
taken prisoner. James, whose personal courage it had been usual to
praise, turned early from the fight and fled towards Dublin. The rout
of fugitives hurried through the pass of Duleek, covered by the French
infantry, who had been resisting young Schomberg's flank attack all the
day. William is said to have been slack in the pursuit; Schomberg's
death, and his own exhaustion, after having been thirty-five hours out
of the last forty on horseback, may have been the cause of this. On
neither side was the loss very great. Of the English about 500 are said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
to have been killed, of the Irish 1500; but they were chiefly cavalry,
the only trustworthy Irish troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's final flight.</div>

<p>James, having reached Dublin, summoned the Lord Mayor and principal
Catholic citizens to the castle. Forgetful of his own speedy flight,
he upbraided the Irish for cowardice, and vowed he would never more
command an Irish army. He then at once took flight again, hurried to
Waterford, and thence by Kinsale to France. Lauzun and Tyrconnel,
with the remains of their army, also thought it desirable to evacuate
the capital, which William entered in triumph. For a short time he
thought of returning to England, for news of the defeat of Beachy Head
and of the battle of Fleurus had reached him, and his presence in
London seemed necessary. But when he heard of the courageous spirit
showed by the nation, and knew that the only use Tourville had made
of his victory was to attack and burn Teignmouth, thus still further
exasperating the people, he felt that the crisis was over, that he
might remain to complete his victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Limerick.</div>

<p>He gradually conquered the country as far as Limerick. There the
Irish stood at bay. In the eyes of the French commander nothing could
be more useless than the attempt to defend the city. "The walls could
be knocked down with roasted apples," said Lauzun. He consequently
withdrew his troops, and the Irish were left to themselves, under
the command of Sarsfield, the only Irish general who seems to have
possessed any military character, and vain though their hopes seemed to
Lauzun, the defence of the city was successful. The want of artillery
at first checked the proceedings of the besiegers. A daring raid,
headed by Sarsfield, destroyed the convoy which was bringing up the
siege train. The artillery was buried and exploded, and Sarsfield's
party returned unhurt. Then came the heavy rains which occur at this
<span class="sidenote">William returns to England. Sept. 6.</span>
season in Ireland; the country around the town became a marsh. A final
vigorous assault proved unsuccessful, and the siege was raised. This
check was somewhat balanced by the success of an expedition planned and
<span class="sidenote">Marlborough's success in the south.</span>
commanded by Marlborough, which had landed in the south, and in five
weeks had conquered both Cork and Kinsale. William returned to England
in September, intrusting the government to three Lords Justices, and
the management of the war to Ginkel. But no further military operation
of importance took place till May in the following year.</p>

<p>The northern and eastern part of the island was in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
the English, and brought under some sort of government by the Lords
Justices. In that part trade and industry had revived. In the Irish
portion of the island, into which the Celtic inhabitants had crowded,
there was wild confusion and much distress. Gangs of robbers infested
the country, the soldiers were little better themselves than robbers.
The currency of James's brass money entirely ruined trade. As usual
in Ireland, jealousy of race began to show itself. In the Councils of
Regency and of War, to whom the management of James's affairs were
intrusted, men not of Irish blood had considerable influence; they were
therefore involved in constant quarrels with the purely Irish party.
Some order however began to show itself when Tyrconnel returned from
France, accompanied by a French general of ability called St. Ruth. St.
Ruth devoted himself with extreme energy to discipline the crowd of
disorderly bandits whom he had to command, and prepared as well as he
could to oppose the advance of Ginkel, who, seconded by Tollemache and
<span class="sidenote">St. Ruth comes from France.</span> Mackay, moved
in the beginning of June from their headquarters at Mullingar. The
French generals, both now and before, had been of opinion that Athlone
was the right spot for the Irish to make a stand. It lay almost in
the middle of the island, half on one side, half on the other of the
Shannon, separating the provinces of Leinster and Connaught. Ginkel
determined that he would take this place, which seemed to him to be the
key of the Irish frontier. It was a work of no common difficulty. St.
Ruth thought the attempt absolutely hopeless. "His master," he said of
Ginkel, "ought to hang him for attempting to take the town, mine ought
to hang me if I lose it." The half of the town upon the English side of
the river was taken on the 19th, but the real difficulty yet remained.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYONE_SIEGE_OF_ALTHONE" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYONE_SIEGE_OF_ALTHONE"></a>Siege of Athlone.</span> The narrow bridge
which joined the two towns was gallantly defended. There was a ford
lower down, but it was almost impassable. During the rest of the month
the efforts of the besiegers were in vain. At last want of supplies
compelled them either to succeed or to retreat. A gallant assault
on the ford, which was almost up to the necks of the men, proved
successful; to the astonishment and anger of St. Ruth the town was
taken (June 30).</p>

<p>In spite of the advice of Sarsfield and the rest of the Irish generals,
who wisely wished to employ their undisciplined troops in a partisan
warfare, St. Ruth determined to fight. He fell back about thirty miles
from Athlone, to the hill of Aghrim, where his troops occupied rising
ground, covered along its whole front by a deep bog; while along the
bottom of the firm ground ran enclosures, which were turned into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
breastworks. Against these difficulties Ginkel marched. But the
Irish, now well posted and well commanded, showed such firmness,
that it seemed probable they would make good their position, and
evening was already drawing on, when at length Mackay, with the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Aghrim. July 12, 1691.</span>
English and Huguenot cavalry, succeeded in passing the bog, and placing
his troops on the flank of the Irish army. At this critical moment St.
Ruth was killed. With singular folly, his friends concealed his death,
not only from his men, but also from his generals. Sarsfield had been
ordered to remain immoveable with reserves till St. Ruth ordered his
advance, as the order did not come Sarsfield did not move, and the
victory of the English thus became complete. The Irish army broke up,
and was pursued with relentless cruelty; 6000 or 7000 Irish are said
to have been put to death as they fled. The plain beyond the field of
battle was so studded with white corpses, that it was described as
looking like a pasture covered with flocks of sheep.</p>

<p>This battle completed the conquest of Ireland. The fall of Galway
immediately followed, and Ginkel proceeded to attack for a second
time the city of Limerick. The chances were now all in favour of the
English, while the Irish were thoroughly disheartened by their late
defeat. Ginkel's army was well supplied, and all hope of succour was
<span class="sidenote">Second siege and capitulation of Limerick. Oct.

occupied the Shannon. Under these circumstances a capitulation was
granted, the terms of which were fairly favourable to the Irish. By the
military treaty, all officers and soldiers who desired it were conveyed
to France, under command of their own generals. By the civil treaty,
the Roman Catholics were promised the enjoyment of such privileges as
they had enjoyed in the reign of Charles II. To all who took the oath
of allegiance a perfect amnesty was promised. It is to the disgrace of
England that this treaty with regard to the Catholics was not kept.
<span class="sidenote">End of the Irish war.</span> For the time,

established so firmly, that for more than a century, in spite of the
difficulties which more than once beset the English Government, no
outbreak of the Irishry against the Englishry was even suggested.</p>

<p>In Scotland, at length, the establishment of the Government was
<span class="sidenote">Revolution completed in Scotland.</span> equally
complete. The members of the factious Club had gone so far as to make
common cause with the Jacobites. But in the Parliament which met in
1690, under the management of Melville as Lord High Commissioner, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
Government succeeded in obtaining a majority. The union among its
opponents was at once dissolved. A general acquiescence met the
re-establishment of the Presbyterian form of Church government, and
no further difficulties of importance were to be apprehended. William
could now turn his attention to the affairs of England and of the
Continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jacobite plots in England.</div>

<p>In England, from the middle of 1690, the Jacobite intrigues
continued. The lenity shown by William, after the abortive efforts
of the Jacobites during the threatened French invasion, encouraged
further conspiracies. It seemed certain that William's presence would
be required abroad, and that again during his absence an opportunity
would be offered for striking a blow against the Government. In
December 1690, a meeting was held of the leading Jacobites, and it
was determined that Preston should be sent to St. Germains. He was to
beg James to return to England, bringing with him a sufficient French
force to secure his success, but at the same time, in the name of the
Jacobites, he was to intreat him to allow the Protestant religion
to remain undisturbed, and to rule in strict accordance with law.
<span class="sidenote">Preston's plot thwarted.</span> Besides this
general letter, separate papers were intrusted to Preston, especially
one from the nonjuring Bishop Turner, apparently in the name of
Sancroft and his brother Bishops. He also took with him notes as to
the most vulnerable points of the coast. But the captain of the ship
which was engaged to take him over thought it wiser to inform Lord
Caermarthen what he was doing, and just as the messengers thought they
were safe out of the river, a vessel of remarkable swiftness belonging
to Lord Caermarthen's son suddenly appeared alongside, and they were
discovered hidden among the gravel which formed the ballast of their
vessel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's successful policy abroad.</div>

<p>The capture of Preston, and the disclosure of the Jacobite plot,
allowed William to go abroad, leaving the complete investigation of the
treason to his ministers in England. On the Continent his diplomacy had
been singularly successful. He had brought together a great coalition,
and had succeeded in winning the Duke of Savoy, whom the King of France
had reckoned among his allies, and whose territory closed the passage
of the French to the Spanish dominions in Italy. Success would have
cemented the coalition, and induced Denmark and Sweden, which were
still wavering, to join it. But in rapidity of action a coalition is
seldom a match for a single power, and Louis was able
to forestall the action of the allies, and capture the important fortress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
of Mons, in spite of all William's efforts to relieve it. But this first
success, though damaging to the coalition, produced no very important
military events; the advantages of the French both in Spain and
Italy were counterbalanced by the disasters which befell their allies
<span class="sidenote">First crisis of the war over.</span>
the Turks in Hungary, and the main armies in Flanders under William and
Luxemburg were content merely to watch each other. The first crisis of
the war was in fact over. The centre of the coalition was William; his
strength was derived from his position as King of England; deprived of
that position, he would have lost most of his influence, and the only
chance of depriving him of it had been the success of the Irish. It was
in Ireland, therefore, that the real crisis of the war had arrived.
The defeat of James at the Boyne in 1690, and of St. Ruth at Aghrim
almost exactly a year after, had thus rendered all hopes of destroying
William's position futile. Once again, in the following year, the same
critical situation of affairs arose. With the battle of La Hogue the
success of James became hopeless, and though the war continued for
many years, there is no other point in it which can really be called
critical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James's hopes upheld by the treason of the
ministry</div>

<p>The causes which led James still to cherish hope, and which
induced him to persuade Louis to contemplate that invasion of England
to which the battle of La Hogue put an end, are to be found in the
conduct of the Jacobite party in England: for while William's attention
was constantly turned to the Continent, treason found its way among his
own immediate ministers. Uncertain even yet of the stability of the
new Government, three of the greatest among them determined to be safe
on either issue. Admiral Russell, and Godolphin, head of the Treasury,
succeeded in obtaining written pardons from James; and Marlborough,
whose previous treachery might have been supposed unpardonable, made
such a show of repentance, that he obtained the same favour, promising
in exchange, when he should be in command of the English troops, to
bring them over to the enemy. But even the treachery of Marlborough
<span class="sidenote">and of Marlborough.</span> partook of the
greatness of his character. His views reached far beyond this
commonplace act of treason. He was already devising plans by which
the fate of England and of Europe should be in his own hands. As his
schemes were not yet ready, though the opportunity he had mentioned to
James arose in Flanders, he contrived to excuse himself from performing
his promise. But before long circumstances led him to believe
that he might carry out his treacherous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
plans in a way more in accordance with his own wishes. The session of
Parliament had been a somewhat stormy one. The immense emoluments of
place-holders had excited the anger of the Opposition, and although
the extreme measures suggested, which went so far as to cut down all
official salaries to £500, had destroyed all attempts at wholesome
reform, there was much continued discontent against the Court. There
had been bitter quarrels also between the Upper and Lower Houses upon
new arrangements of the Treason Law which had been suggested, and all
parties seemed to be combined in mistrust and dislike of the favours
lavished on foreigners. This state of affairs seemed to open the way
for Marlborough's intrigues. In fact, years of rivalry and several
bloody wars, coupled with constant outrages on one side or the other
on distant colonies, had rendered the Dutch at least as hateful to the
English as the French; nor was the feeling diminished by seeing many
of the greater and more lucrative offices in the hands of members of
the hated nation. By working on this feeling, Marlborough hoped to
induce Parliament to petition the King to discharge all foreign troops,
a line of conduct which at a subsequent period was actually followed.
Once rid of these troops (and he thought it impossible that William,
situated as he was, could withstand a formal Parliamentary request),
Marlborough relied on his own ability to induce the English army,
which was very jealous of William's liking for his own Dutch troops,
to further his views. The absolute authority which his wife exercised
over the Princess Anne enabled him to secure her adhesion to his plans.
She wrote friendly and repentant letters to her father. With the army
at his command, and with the Protestant heiress inclined to favour his
projects, Marlborough would declare for James, and secure his return
without the danger of foreign invasion, without the shedding of a drop
of blood. Such at least was the story he told the Jacobites. Men who
knew his character mistrusted him. It was more likely, they thought,
and this seems to have been his real plan, that he would declare not
for King James, but for Princess Anne herself. He would thus become
indirectly the ruler of England, and as such the head of the European
coalition, and the arbiter of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYTWO_MARLBOROUGH_SUSPECTED_OF_TREASON" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYTWO_MARLBOROUGH_SUSPECTED_OF_TREASON"></a>Marlborough is deprived of his offices. Jan. 10,
1692.</div>

<p>Luckily for William, even the Jacobites looked with suspicion on the
scheme; Bentinck received information of Marlborough's treachery. The
King, placed on his guard, stripped him of all his offices; and when Anne,
who knew well the reason of his disgrace, persisted in ignoring it and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
bringing the Duchess of Marlborough to Court, the spirit of the Queen
<span class="sidenote">The Queen's quarrel with the Princess Anne.</span>
was roused, and a bitter quarrel broke out between the sisters. The
full details of the plot were not at the time known, and a false plot,
invented and brought to light by a wretched informer of the name of
Fuller, gave Marlborough an opportunity of ostentatiously clearing
his character. He was thus regarded as a martyr to the jealousy of
William, and to an unreasonable dislike of her sister on the part of
the Queen.</p>

<p>Although for the time the danger of Marlborough's treason seemed to
have been escaped, it was undoubtedly the knowledge of its existence,
and of the feeling prevalent among William's other ministers, that
encouraged James still to retain hopes of success in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre of Glencoe. Feb. 13.</div>

<p>Before passing to the events to which those hopes gave rise, an
incident must be mentioned which, though it had but little effect
at the moment, has been always considered as a blot on William's
character, and added point to the bitter attacks directed against
him towards the close of his reign. Melville had proved unequal to
the task of governing Scotland, and the management of the affairs
of that country had passed almost entirely into the hands of the
Dalrymples, father and son, the elder of whom was President of the
Court of Session, having been lately raised to the peerage by the
title of Viscount Stair. The son, known as the Master of Stair, was
appointed Secretary for Scotland, resident in London. To him now fell
the duty of pacifying the Highlands, where the civil war continued
to smoulder. Unable to give the Highlanders any effectual support,
James had told them that they were at liberty to make peace with the
conqueror. It has been already mentioned that local politics had more
to do with the conduct of the Highlanders than any question as to the
reigning dynasty, and that their hatred directed against the head
of the Campbell clan arose largely from the condition of dependence
to him in which they found themselves, and which was due in a great
degree to unpaid arrears of rent. It was determined now to adopt a
plan which had been formerly suggested, and to expend some £15,000 in
relieving them from their difficulties. The distribution of this money
was unwisely intrusted to Breadalbane, himself a Campbell, and too much
interested in the encroachments of that house not to be unpopular.
He was profoundly and justly mistrusted by the Highlanders, and the
negotiations for the distribution of the money proceeded but
slowly, the chief leader of the opposition to the settlement being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
Macdonald of Glencoe, one of that tribe which had suffered most from
the growth of the Campbells. Pressure was put upon the Highlanders
to bring the negotiation to a conclusion. A proclamation was issued,
promising pardon to all who, before the 31st of December 1691, should
swear to live peaceably under the existing Government. All who
refused to take this oath were to be regarded as public enemies. As
the Government appeared to be in earnest, the chiefs yielded, making
it a sort of point of honour to yield as slowly as possible. In this
foolish contest of honour Mac Ian of Glencoe was unfortunately the
victor. Not till the very day named did he appear at Fort William to
take the oaths. When he arrived there he found to his dismay that there
was no magistrate to receive them, and he was compelled forthwith to
set out through the winter snow to Inverary to find a magistrate.
The journey was so difficult that it was not till the 6th of January
that he reached Inverary. Under the circumstances, the sheriff there
consented, though after the prescribed date, to receive the oath, and
sent it, with a certificate stating the circumstances to Edinburgh.
The slowness of Macdonald had played into the hands of his enemies the
Campbells. Breadalbane and Argyle were at one in their determination to
use their advantage, and they found a ready assistant in the Master of
Stair, whose views, free from all local feeling, were of the sternest
description, and who thought the Highlanders should be treated as
uncivilized barbarians. He had been disappointed at the submission
of the clans, and rejoiced at the opportunity of making one example.
By his means the certificate granted by the sheriff appears to have
been suppressed, and an order was drawn up and laid before William, in
which, along with other instructions to the commander of the army in
Scotland, were these words with regard to the clan of Glencoe: "It will
be proper, for the vindication of public justice, to extirpate that
set of thieves." William signed the order, probably without carefully
reading it, almost certainly without understanding what Dalrymple
meant by extirpation. His scheme was one of the utmost barbarity. A
detachment of soldiers was sent into the glen as though on a friendly
mission. They were kindly received and hospitably kept for more than
a week. Then, at a fixed date, when other troops were to have stopped
all the passes, they suddenly fell upon their kindly hosts and cruelly
murdered them. The plan was but partially carried out. The passes had
not been stopped, and not more than thirty-eight of the Highlanders
were actually killed. But the villages were destroyed, the cattle driven
off, and it is unknown how many more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
perished as they fled in the dead of winter in the wild mountains which
surrounded their glen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Threatened invasion of England.</div>

<p>It was just after this event, in March, that William went abroad
to resume the Continental war. As usual, his absence was the time of
danger for England. An invasion from France had long been planned, and
was on the point of taking place. Excited by the constant untruthful
account of his agents in England, encouraged by the artful and
well-planned treachery of Marlborough and William's other ministers,
James had never ceased to press upon Louis the wisdom of an assault
upon England. His urgent instances had always been met by the
opposition of the war minister Louvois. Conscious that his superiority
lay in the organization of large disciplined armies in the field, and
led by the experience of his life to look to the great operations
of regular warfare on the Rhine and in Italy as the real sources of
greatness for France, that minister had always set his face against
little wars. He was moreover jealous of the influence of Lauzun at the
Court of St. Germains, and had repeatedly pointed out what was very
true, the falseness of the Jacobite accounts, the weak character of
James, the total untrustworthiness of his resources, and the consequent
necessity which would be laid upon France of carrying out such an
invasion, in fact, entirely unaided. He had dwelt also upon the strong
national feeling of the English, repeatedly exhibited when an invasion
was threatened, and the uncertainty, even were the attempt successful,
of the continued assistance and alliance of a Prince so ignorant and
selfish as James. Nevertheless, in this instance James was right, not
that all and more than all that Louvois urged was not true, but that
the separation of England from the coalition, the command of the sea,
and the blow which would be dealt to William's influence, were worth
any sacrifice which France might make. Louvois' arguments, however, had
hitherto prevailed; the assistance given to James had been but slight.
But Louvois' death (which took place on the 16th of July 1691) opened
brighter hopes to the exiled King. Louis was at length persuaded; and
a vast plan was made which, had it been carried out as intended, might
well have been successful. An army was secretly collected during the
winter on the coast of Normandy. Two fleets were assembled at Brest and
at Toulon, numbering together 80 ships of the line, and placed under
the command of Tourville and D'Estrées, to convoy this army to England.
James, misled by his hopes and by the double-dealing of Russell,
believed, and made Louis believe, that the English fleet was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span>
disaffected. Secure in this belief, it was without much anxiety that
the invaders found the spring far advanced, while still the weather
prevented the junction of the fleets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of La Hogue. May 19.</div>

<p>But meanwhile all secresy had been lost. The Queen in England, and
William in Holland, had put forth all their energy, and a combined
Dutch and English fleet of 90 ships was in the Channel under command of
Russell. At last one French squadron, that of Tourville, consisting of
44 ships, made its appearance. It was supposed that, weak as it was, it
was sufficient for all necessary purposes; it could probably beat the
Dutch contingent, and the English fleet was of no account, for neither
Russell nor his men were likely to fight. Relying on this false belief,
Louis issued peremptory orders to his admiral to cover the invasion,
and fight the enemy wherever he met them. But James's folly had already
gone far to thwart any hopes based upon the temper of the English. He
had issued a Declaration, the work of his counsellor Melfort, excepting
from all hope of pardon, not only a long list of gentlemen by name, but
whole classes of Englishmen, all judges, jurymen, and lawyers who had
been employed in any of the prosecutions of Jacobites, all magistrates
who did not instantly (regardless of where they might be) make common
cause with him upon his appearance, all spies and informers who had
divulged his secrets, even the insignificant fishermen of Sheerness
who had hindered him on his first attempt to escape from England.
So ridiculous, so ill-judged was the Declaration, that, far from
suppressing it, the English Council reprinted it, and distributed it
largely, with a few pungent criticisms of their own. Even Jacobites had
to confess that at least 500 men were excepted. It is easy to conceive
the effect of such a Declaration, when contrasted with William's noble
Act of Grace of the preceding year. What James's folly had thus half
done the Queen's sagacity completed. Urged on all sides to apprehend
known Jacobites, with the denunciations of a plot, perfectly fictitious
indeed, but none the less very plausible, the creation of a rascal of
the name of Young, just placed in her hands, and fully conscious of the
intrigues of Russell her admiral, she wrote a noble letter, expressing
her trust and reliance on the patriotism of her fleet, and sent it to
Russell, with orders to read it to the captains of his fleet. Russell,
at heart a Whig and a devoted lover of his profession, hesitated no
longer. He would fight, he said, though King James himself were in the
hostile fleet. He went from ship to ship, encouraging the crews, and
when Tourville bore down upon him there was no sign of faint-heartedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
in the English fleet. Overpowered by numbers, the French fleet fled,
broke into fragments, and was destroyed piecemeal. But twelve of the
largest ships, with Tourville himself, took refuge under the Forts of
La Hogue, under the eyes of James and Marshal Bellefonds, commander
of the army. There, as they lay in two divisions in shallow water,
they were attacked on two successive days by a flotilla of English
boats, under Admiral Rooke; and under the guns of the forts, which were
supposed to render them quite secure, they were taken and burnt, while
James looked on and saw the destruction of this his last hope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second crisis of the war over.</div>

<p>This great victory over the French, the first which the nation had
won for many years, drove the people wild with delight. All the more
heavy was their disappointment at the feeble manner in which it was
followed up, and at the ill success of the war in the Netherlands in
the latter part of the year. An expedition against St. Malo failed
through the jealousy of its commanders. <span class="sidenote">Subsequent ill success of the fleet.</span> The broken fleet of Tourville,
unable to keep the sea, assumed a new form. French cruisers and
privateers covered the ocean, and hundreds of English merchantmen fell
a prey to them. The commercial world suffered more heavily from the
individual enterprises of men such as the privateer captains Jean Bart
and Dugouay Trouin than from the great united fleets of France, and
almost regretted the victory which had called to life such enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Namur. June 30.</div>

<p>The chief incidents of the war in the Netherlands&mdash;the fall of
the great fortress of Namur, and the battle of Steinkirk&mdash;were
very characteristic of the art of war at this period. It was a time of
slow, methodical, and scientific movement in the field, but of great
advance in the art of attacking and defending fortresses, which in the
hands of Vauban and Cohorn was so far perfected, that for more than
a century no important change was made in the system they advocated.
Louis did not press his advantage; after taking Namur his army was
diminished by detachments sent to other quarters, and William thought
he saw an opportunity of striking a heavy blow against his weakened
opponent. A traitor in the English army had habitually informed Marshal
Luxemburg of every movement of the allied troops. His correspondence
was discovered, and with a pistol at his breast he was forced to write
false information which William dictated. Having thus, as he hoped,
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Steinkirk. Aug. 4.</span> misdirected
the vigilance of his enemy, the King determined upon a surprise. The
unexpected difficulties offered by the country prevented its success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
Luxemburg got his troops into order with extraordinary rapidity, and
the English division under Mackay soon found itself hotly engaged. It
was successful in its first efforts, but the household troops of Louis
were sent against it, and Count Solmes withheld the supports which
should have come to its assistance. The division was nearly destroyed,
and the anger of the English blazed up fiercely against the Dutch
general, who, set over the head of the English commanders, thus basely
deserted their troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discontented Parliament. Nov. 4.</div>

<p>It was thus, with many causes of discontent, that, upon the return
of William to England, the Parliament assembled. Mismanagement had
neutralized the great victory of La Hogue; the discovery of Preston's
plot had not been followed by a single act of justice upon the
Jacobites, a sharp quarrel had broken out between the Queen and her
sister, which, as Marlborough's treachery was unknown, seemed merely
capricious and causeless; the war in the Netherlands had been a mere
disastrous repetition of the last year's campaign; William's chief
misfortune was commonly attributed to the mismanagement, or perhaps
the treachery of the Dutch general; the House of Lords had been
alienated by the apprehension of two of its members, who had been
put to their recognizances, and no further charge brought against
them; the harvest in England had failed, so that corn had doubled its
natural price; and the police had grown so lax that highwaymen in gangs
of twenty and thirty infested the country, and robbed almost within
sight of London. Both Lords and Commons consequently entered warmly
upon the consideration of the state of the nation. But the continued
jealousy which existed between the two Houses brought their inquiries
to nothing. As yet neither Ministry nor Opposition was sufficiently
organized to secure the advantages either of stable government or of
thorough reform. The administration was carried on as before with all
the evils of a Ministry divided against itself, in the presence of a
factious and disorganized Opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYTHREE_MONTAGUS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYTHREE_MONTAGUS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES"></a>The Land Tax.</div>

<p>Some important steps were however taken with regard to finance.
There was still a tolerably unanimous feeling in favour
of the war, and money had to be procured. In the
arrangements for supplying the necessary money, the financial talents
of Charles Montague, a young and rising member of the Whig party,
first became conspicuous. Early known as a man of letters, and the
author in company with Prior of "The Town and Country Mouse,"
he had been introduced to the King by his patron the Earl of Dorset,
and, after strengthening his position by a marriage with the Dowager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
Countess of Manchester, had entered political life, and had been
appointed one of the Lords of the Treasury in 1691. The financial
measures recommended consisted of a reorganization of the Land
Tax and of the first establishment of Government loans. The extraordinary
expenses of Government had in early times been met by subsidies.
These subsidies were levied both on moveables and on land,
but were chiefly supported by an assessment on the land at the nominal
rate of four shillings in the pound. Land had increased greatly in
value as the demand for it increased, while gold and silver had fallen
greatly in value after the discovery of America. In the assessment for
subsidies neither of these circumstances was taken into consideration.
The four shilling land tax had come in reality to be less than
twopence in the pound. During the Commonwealth, and subsequently,
a different method of taxation had been followed. The
sum to be raised had been first determined, and each landowner
had been called upon to pay a proportional share. In 1692 the Land
Tax was reintroduced and reorganized. A new valuation was made,
and upon this basis a tax was annually laid upon the land varying
from a minimum of one shilling in time of peace to four shillings
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the National Debt. Jan. 20, 1693.</span>
in times of emergency. Four shillings on this new valuation produced
about £2,000,000. This sum fell considerably short of what was
required. In addition, therefore, a loan, which is the origin of the
National Debt, was raised. Money was plentiful in the country, and was
so easily obtained, that bubble companies and stock-jobbing had become
rife. Montague determined to turn some of this superfluous wealth to
the use of the country, and to spread the payment of the debt over
several generations. The plan at first adopted in raising these loans
was not exactly the same as our present method of perpetual funding.
The lenders were life annuitants, and the interest of the loan was
secured on new duties on beer and other liquors. As each annuitant died
his annuity was divided among the survivors, till their number was
reduced to seven, who would at that time be naturally in receipt of
an enormous interest on their original loan. After that, on the death
of each of those seven, his annuity lapsed to Government. The whole
debt would therefore be extinguished at the death of the longest-lived
annuitant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disastrous campaign. 1693.</div>

<p>The money thus collected was soon spent upon another disastrous
campaign. Louis, in spite of the exhausted condition of
his country, made extraordinary efforts in all directions.
As far as the English only were concerned, the two great
events of the campaign were the battle of Landen and the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
of the Smyrna fleet. Louis, using his late conquest, Namur,
for his point of departure, had formed two armies, one under Boufflers,
the other under Luxemburg, and hoped to repeat the triumph of
former years by the capture of either Liège or Brussels. But he found
it was impossible to take either of those cities without fighting a
pitched battle with William. In spite of the earnest request of his
generals, he withdrew to Versailles, and removed the army of Boufflers
to the Rhine. Though thus weakened, Luxemburg, by a threatened
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Landen. July 19.</span>
attack upon Liège, induced William to reduce his forces
to save that town, and then falling upon him at Landen,
defeated him after a battle, the stubbornest and bloodiest
of the war. William's skill somewhat neutralized the effect of his
defeat, and Charleroi was the only new acquisition of the French
in the Low Countries.</p>

<p>The loss of the Smyrna fleet made perhaps even greater impression
upon the English than the defeat of Landen. The fleet, in which
was accumulated more than a year's supply for the Eastern markets,
and which numbered 400 ships, was to be convoyed in safety from
London through the Straits of Gibraltar. After passing the Channel
<span class="sidenote">Loss of the Smyrna fleet. June.</span>
unopposed, the English admirals, supposing that the danger was over,
withdrew towards England with their ships of war, and the trading fleet
passed onward, guarded only by Rooke with about twenty men of war. Off
St. Vincent it fell in with the whole combined navy of France, for
the squadrons of Toulon and Brest had joined, and were lying in wait
for their rich prey off the coast of Spain. The convoy was completely
broken up, many vessels destroyed, while the others fled for safety in
all directions. The loss of the English was estimated at many millions.
The disaster would certainly have been much worse had not two Dutch
ships which formed part of the convoy gallantly sacrificed themselves,
and engaged no less than eighteen of the enemy's fleet.</p>

<p>In other parts of Europe the armies of France were equally
successful. Catalonia had been invaded and Rosas taken. Catinat had
defeated the Duke of Savoy in the great battle of Marsiglia (Oct. 3).
The Turks had compelled the Germans to raise the siege of Belgrade.
Yet, in spite of these successes, France was so worn out, that hints of
a desire for peace began to reach the English King.</p>

<p>The possibility of being called upon to settle this great point, and
the necessity of taking speedy advantage of his enemy's weakness,
brought more clearly home to William the great difficulty which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
beset his reign. For the position which was necessary to enable him
<span class="sidenote">William's difficulty with regard to his
Parliament.</span> to engage authoritatively in the affairs of Europe,
for the money required for the pay of his army, and for the subsidies
by which alone the allies were kept true to their engagements, he was
dependent upon Parliament. For at the Revolution the Parliament had
taken upon itself the supreme authority of the nation. Yet upon that
Parliament he was unable to rely; for the representative body, though
conscious of its power, had not yet learnt to use it advantageously.
It was that worst of all forms of supreme power, a large disorganized
assembly. Well aware that, both as head of a confederacy and as a
general, freedom of action was necessary for him, William had kept
as far as possible the management of foreign affairs in his own
hands, and had sought to win the favour of all parties by a judicious
impartiality. In the main he had been well supported in his foreign
policy; but faction was so rife, the increasing divergence of opinion
so great, and the capricious character of the Lower House so evident,
that he could take no important step with confidence. He could not
answer for a year's continuance of the war spirit, nor be certain that
any steps he might take with regard to peace would be acknowledged even
by his own ministers. It became necessary, if possible, to introduce
some order and organization into this uncertain body. It would be
better to risk a formal opposition of a certain number, and be sure of
unanimity in his own administration, than to be at the caprice of a
<span class="sidenote">He forms a united Whig ministry.</span>
popular assembly. William therefore listened to the suggestions of
Sunderland, and determined to place himself entirely in the hands
of the Whig party, that party to which he owed his elevation to the
throne, and which was pledged to the continuation of the war. During
the next two years a change in ministry was gradually carried out,
which ended by the establishment in 1696 of the first united ministry
in English history. It was led by the chiefs of the Whig party, of
which the leaders were Somers, Halifax, Russell and Wharton (known
afterwards as the Junto).</p>

<p>Parliament during these years was occupied in financial arrangements
to meet the constant drain of the war, and in perpetual party
struggles which terminated in the complete triumph of the Whigs,
and in the substitution of the leaders of that party for their Tory
rivals in all the chief offices of the administration. The first trial of
strength between the parties arose upon the question of the naval
administration of the former year. The whole nation smarted under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
the disasters which had followed on the great victory of La Hogue,
<span class="sidenote">Party struggles.</span> which the Whigs had
attributed not only to the maladministration of the two Tory admirals
to whom the fleet had been intrusted, but also to treachery. It was
impossible, they argued, that Louis could have denuded the Channel of
his fleet, and allowed a junction of his admirals so far south as St.
Vincent, unless he had had good reason to believe that the rich prey
he desired would fall into his hands but weakly guarded. The Tories,
who were unable to deny the maladministration, were anxious to exclude
the word "treacherous" from the motion. The Whig party was however
triumphant, and by a considerable majority the word was retained. But
though the general assertion of treason was thus made, the Commons, as
was not unusual, shrunk from fixing the treason upon any particular
person, and each individual accused was acquitted by a small majority.
Enough had been done, however, to give the King a fair opportunity of
re-establishing Russell, the great enemy of Nottingham the Secretary,
at the head of the Admiralty, and thus taking one step towards his
Whig ministry. It was impossible for Nottingham to remain in office
with Russell; he was consequently removed from the Secretaryship,
and a fresh vacancy thus created, which, after some delay, caused by
the conscientious scruples of Shrewsbury, who felt keenly the fault
he had once committed in tampering with the Jacobites, was filled by
that nobleman, one of the Whig chiefs. At the close of the session,
therefore, William found himself with most of his chief officers
belonging to the Whig party. Trenchard and Shrewsbury were Secretaries.
Russell was the head of the Admiralty. Somers was Lord Keeper, and
Montague Chancellor of the Exchequer. The only two Tories of importance
left were Caermarthen, Lord President, and Godolphin, at the head of
the Treasury. But the character of the latter minister led him to
devote himself almost exclusively to his official business, of which
he was master. Caermarthen was therefore, in fact, the only important
element of discord in the administration.</p>

<p>Montague owed his elevation to the continued success of his financial
plans. A fresh loan, known as the Lottery Loan&mdash;because though
the whole rate of interest was low, in exceptional cases chosen by
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_ESTABLISHMENT_BANK_OF_ENGLAND" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_ESTABLISHMENT_BANK_OF_ENGLAND"></a>Establishment of the Bank of England.</span>
lottery it was very high&mdash;was successfully negotiated,
and more important than this, the Bank of England
was triumphantly established. Banking with private
goldsmiths had come into fashion within the last two reigns, when
the convenience of cheques in the place of ready-money payments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
had become obvious, while the advantage to the banker who had
the use of the ready money was also plain. The fault of the system
was its insecurity, which had been proved by the not unfrequent
bankruptcy of one or other of the banking goldsmiths. A Scotchman
of the name of Paterson had some years previously suggested
the plan of a national bank, by which the Government should
obtain some of the advantages of the banker, and the public, while
gaining the convenience of cheques, should have a better security
than private goldsmiths offered. This scheme Montague now adopted.
He borrowed rather upwards of a million, and formed the lenders
into a banking company, allowing them to treat the loan to Government
as part of their capital, the interest of which, secured upon
taxes, gave them the requisite supply of ready money. They were
bound to pursue no other business except banking, yet, even with
this restriction, so desirable did the plan seem, that it was at once
triumphantly carried through. As a contingent advantage to Government,
it is to be observed that the company, which included many
of the chiefs of the moneyed interest, were pledged, for their own
preservation, to support the present settlement of the throne. Their
existence depended upon the regular payment of the interest upon
their loan, which it was scarcely possible that the Jacobites, if successful,
would pay. The importance of this point became very obvious
afterwards, when, in more than one crisis, the credit of Government
was saved by advances from the Bank. One other important measure
<span class="sidenote">The Triennial Act passed. Dec. 1694.</span>
was carried by this Parliament, and that also was in accordance with
the principles of the Whigs. This was the Triennial Act, limiting the
duration of Parliament to three years. The King, always jealous of his
prerogative, had already once refused his assent to this Bill; but now,
having placed himself in Whig hands, he withdrew his opposition, and
the Bill was passed.</p>

<p>He was indeed in no position to enter into a struggle with his
Parliament. A great blow was falling on him, which unhinged him more
than any difficulties or defeats had yet done. This was the
<span class="sidenote">Death of Queen Mary. Dec. 20.</span> death of
his wife, who had sickened of the smallpox, and, after a short illness,
died on the 20th of December 1694. Her death caused universal sorrow in
England and among the Protestant interest on the Continent, while it
raised the hopes of James and his friends, who believed, not without a
show of reason, that William succeeded in holding his place chiefly by
means of the popularity of his Queen. Their hopes proved ill founded,
for though at first the King seemed so broken-hearted that he declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
he could never again lead an army, when once he had conquered his
first grief, he resumed his old energy, and success such as he had
never yet met with attended his efforts both at home and abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYFIVE_EXPULSION_OF_TREVOR" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYFIVE_EXPULSION_OF_TREVOR"></a>Expulsion of Trevor for venality, March
1695,</div>

<p>Meanwhile in England there was no cessation in the strife of
parties. The Whigs pursued their triumphant course, and combined to
remove the last of their opponents from the Government. Trevor, a
Tory, had in the early part of the reign been made Speaker of the
House, chiefly for the purpose of carrying out Caermarthen's plans of
corruption. Employed in corrupting others, it was not likely that he
should be himself above corruption. Suspicions of his venality having
arisen, the Whigs proceeded to examine the accounts of the City of
London and of the East India Company, which, after much contest, had
obtained a renewal of its charter. The Committee found that the City
had paid Sir John Trevor in the preceding session 1000 guineas for
forwarding a local Bill. The proof was too clear to be questioned.
Trevor from the chair had to put the question whether he was guilty
or not of high crime and misdemeanour, and to declare before all men
that "the Ayes had it." He saved himself from the unutterable ignominy
of announcing his own expulsion by feigning illness. A new Speaker,
Foley, who did not belong clearly to either party, was elected in his
place.</p>

<p>The accounts of the East India Company afforded the Whigs even
greater triumph. Sir Thomas Cook, who was the head of the Company,
confessed to having disbursed very large sums to secure the charter,
but would give no particular accounts. The Commons, determined not to
be thwarted, passed a Bill condemning him to refund all the money thus
spent, in addition to a heavy fine, unless he made a full confession.
In the Upper House the Bill was strongly opposed by Lord Caermarthen,
now Duke of Leeds, who, laying his hand upon his heart, solemnly
averred that he had no personal interest in the matter, and was moved
by public considerations only. It was finally arranged that a joint
Committee of the two Houses should inquire into the expenditure of
the money that had been secretly spent, and that if Cook confessed he
should be held guiltless. The joint Committee met; the King and the
Duke of Portland, whose guilt in the matter had been suggested by the
Tories, were proved perfectly innocent. But £5000 were traced, if not
to the Duke of Leeds himself, at all events to his confidential man of
business. Articles of impeachment were made out against him.
They could not, however, be brought forward, because the man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
business, who would have supplied necessary evidence, had made
his escape to Holland. The Duke of Leeds continued to assert his
innocence, but confessed that he had allowed money to be paid to his
steward, considering this a very different thing from taking it himself.
It also appeared that the money had been refunded the very
morning of the first sitting of the joint Committee. Though <span
class="sidenote">and of Caermarthen. May.</span> foiled of their
impeachment, the Whigs and the Commons had done their work. Leeds was
obliged to retire from active life, and was never afterwards employed
in the administration. The sole discordant member of the Government was
thus got rid of.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_SUCCESS_ABROAD" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_SUCCESS_ABROAD"></a>Success abroad. June 1694.</div>

<p>Abroad likewise affairs took a turn more favourable to England and
the Whigs. Just before the death of Mary the war had entered into a
somewhat new phase. The navies of the two great powers had transferred
the scene of operations to the Mediterranean. Thither Tourville had
gone from Brest, and thither Russell, with the English fleet, had
followed him. He had found means to keep the French fleet in harbour,
and to do good service to the general cause by the relief of Barcelona,
which was on the point of falling into the hands of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treachery of Marlborough.</div>

<p>The absence of the French fleet from Brest, which led to the
supposition that the harbour must be unguarded, seemed to afford an
opportunity for an attack in that quarter. An expedition was planned;
the forces were intrusted to Talmash, while the Duke of Leeds' son
Caermarthen commanded the fleet. It gave occasion for a new act of
villany on the part of Marlborough; though the plan was kept a profound
secret, he contrived to worm it out, and as had happened once or
twice before in his career, he used his knowledge only to lay the
details of the plan before James, and to secure the destruction of
the English expedition. Vauban, the great French engineer, was sent
down to re-fortify the place. Every vantage-ground was crowned with
batteries, and into the trap thus laid for him Talmash had rushed
headlong to meet his death, in company with 700 English soldiers (June
7, 1694). Marlborough's treachery in this instance was rather personal
than political. Talmash alone of the English generals could in any way
compete with him, and he knew that at his death or failure William, who
it must be recollected did not know the full extent of his treachery,
would be obliged to restore him to his command. His treacherous plan
succeeded. He was again employed, though so thoroughly mistrusted, that William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
refused when he went abroad to give the regency to Anne, which he
well knew would be but to give it to Marlborough. But the death
of Mary, which occurred at the close of the year, while it excited
the other Jacobites to action, for a time rendered Marlborough true
to William; for it was followed by a reconciliation between the
King and the Princess Anne, and Marlborough was now content to
wait till the King's death for the completion of his designs. The
more earnest Jacobites followed a different course, and it was in the
midst of a conspiracy aimed against his life by Fenwick, Charnock,
and Porter, that William set out for Flanders (May 1695).</p>

<p>In that country he had no longer the same formidable enemy with
whom to contend. Luxemburg was dead, and his place was ill supplied
by Villeroy and Louis' illegitimate son, the Duke of Maine,
who was sent to learn the art of war under him. As Flanders was
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_CAMPAIGN_IN_FLANDERS" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYFOUR_CAMPAIGN_IN_FLANDERS"></a>Campaign in Flanders. 1695.</span>
expected to be the great seat of war, the bulk of the French army was
placed under Villeroy in that country. Boufflers, with 12,000 men,
guarded the Sambre. William, however, had set his heart upon regaining
Namur. Judicious feints deceived Villeroy as to his intentions, and
suddenly his own army, that of the Brandenburgers and that of the
Elector of Bavaria, marched straight against the city. Boufflers had
just time to throw himself with his troops into the town. A body of
troops under the Prince of Vaudemont had been left to watch Villeroy
in Flanders. When that general advanced, the Prince could not hold
his isolated position, and only succeeded in making good his retreat
through the cowardice of the Duke of Maine. Villeroy advanced almost
unopposed. He took the towns of Dixmuyde and Deynse, the garrisons of
which, contrary to the terms of capitulation, were sent prisoners to
France; and hoping by threatening the capital to draw William from
Namur, he approached and ruthlessly and uselessly bombarded Brussels.
But, undisturbed by Villeroy's man&oelig;uvres, William energetically
pursued the siege. He was assisted by Cohorn, who had originally
fortified the town, and had seen it taken by the skill of his great
rival Vauban. Vauban had since much increased the fortifications, and
Cohorn was eager to regain his honour by capturing it. At length,
after some fierce assaults, in which the English under Lord Cutts, who
for his bravery under fire got the nickname of "the Salamander," had
greatly distinguished themselves, the town surrendered, but the castle
still held out. It became evident to Villeroy that the actual presence of
his army could alone raise the siege. Drawing troops from all the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span>
garrisons, he approached with 80,000 men. But William now felt
himself strong enough to give him battle without withdrawing from his
operations. For three days the armies remained in presence, and William
lay expecting the attack, but Villeroy judged his position too strong
to be taken, and withdrew. The fate of the fortress was now sealed,
but Boufflers thought that his honour demanded that he should stand
an assault; nor was it till the English had succeeded at the cost of
2000 men in making a lodgment in the <span class="sidenote">Surrender
of Namur. Aug. 26.</span> place that he consented to treat, and for
the first time in history a French marshal surrendered a fortress to
a victorious enemy. Having gone through the ceremony of surrender,
Boufflers was much surprised and enraged at being arrested on his road
to France. His angry exclamations against the breach of the terms of
capitulation were met by the reply, that William was only following the
example of Louis with regard to the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse.
He was kept in honourable imprisonment till those garrisons were
restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's triumphant return. Oct. 10.</div>

<p>It was thus no longer as a beaten and unfortunate, though skilful
general, that William returned to England. The Triennial Bill having
come into operation, the present Parliament would have come to a
natural conclusion the following year. It had on the whole acted so
much in favour of William and the Whigs, that William, could he have
prolonged it, would probably have been willing to do so. But he wisely
judged that it would be better to call his new Parliament while still
popular from his successes, than to wait the chances of the <span
class="sidenote">New Whig Parliament. Nov. 22.</span> future year.
The event proved that he was right. A brilliant triumphant progress
through England was followed by the return of a Parliament with an
immense majority favourable to the war and to the Whig interests. Four
Whigs were returned for London. Westminster followed the example of
the neighbouring city, and so great was the enthusiasm that even the
great Tory leader Seymour, whose interest in Devonshire was believed
to render his return for Exeter sure, was defeated in that town. The
Parliament thus assembled had very important work before it, and,
acting in unison with the King, his ministry, and the whole country,
carried it through to a noble conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYSIX_RE_ESTABLISMENT_OF_CURRENCY" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYSIX_RE_ESTABLISMENT_OF_CURRENCY"></a>Re-establishment of the currency.</div>

<p>This important work was the re-establishment of the currency.
The English coin had originally been of hammered
metal, it was constantly liable to inequality in weight,
and being left with raw edges, easily clipped. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
Charles II.'s reign this defect had been partially cured by the use of
machinery, and words had been printed round the edges of the coin;
but as the bad hammered coinage was allowed to be current side by
side with the new milled coinage, the better coinage had either been
hoarded or had left the country, as invariably happens, when some
part of the coinage of the country is of less intrinsic value than the
rest. Consequently the evil became worse. Coin was more constantly
clipped, and as it wore out was more easily counterfeited.
Its defects at length became so obvious that shopkeepers refused to
take it except by weight; thus causing heavy suffering to the lower
orders, who generally received their wages by tale, and had to pay
by weight, and every little transaction became the occasion of a dispute.
So far had the evil gone, that when trials were made in different
parts of the country, the coinage had proved on an average to
be little more than half its proper weight. A re-issue of coin
became absolutely necessary. The arrangements fell into the hands of
Somers and Montague, of John Locke the philosopher, and Isaac
Newton the mathematician. In devising their plan two great
questions met them. By whom should the expense be borne? How
could the inconvenience of the short supply of coin which must
inevitably follow when the present coinage was called in be best
alleviated? A very large minority wished to avoid the difficulty by
keeping the present money in circulation, but lowering its nominal
value. This plan, which was in fact to perpetrate a fraud upon all
creditors, was not likely to find favour with the four sagacious men
with whom the question rested. Two schemes recommended themselves
chiefly to their attention. Locke proposed that, after a certain
fixed date, the coin should be valued by weight only. This prevented
any deficiency in the circulating medium, as the present
money would not be withdrawn from circulation, but it threw the
whole expense of bringing the nominal and real value of the coin
into harmony, not on the Government, but on the individual
possessors of the coin. It was evidently fairer that, where the
evil was a national one, the nation should bear the expense.
Somers suggested that, with extreme secresy, a proclamation should
be prepared, saying that in three days the hammered coin should
pass by weight only, but that those who held it might bring it in
parcels to the mint, where it should be counted and weighed, and
immediately restored, with a written promise of a future payment
of the difference between the nominal and real value of the coin.
Thus the money would be withdrawn from circulation only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
short time necessary to count it, while the nation would subsequently
pay the difference. But for this plan secresy and suddenness were
necessary, or the intervening period would have given opportunity
and temptation for unlimited mutilation of the coinage. Secresy
would have rendered it impossible to consult Parliament, and
Montague, in the existing state of party feeling, shrank from the
responsibility this implied. It was therefore determined to act in a
perfectly honest, simple and straightforward manner; and immediately
on the opening of Parliament, a Bill was framed in accordance
with certain resolutions previously taken. By these it was declared
that the old standard should be kept up, that milled coin should alone
be used, that the loss should fall on the nation, not on individuals,
and that the 4th of May following should be the last day on which
hammered coin should be allowed to be used. The advantage of the
good understanding between the Government and the Bank now
became evident. To meet the expense of the new coinage, £1,200,000
was wanted. The Bank advanced it without difficulty on the security
of a window tax, which took the place of the much hated hearth tax,
and which lasted on almost to our own time. At last the critical day,
the 4th of May, drew near. Fortunately the country was in an
enthusiastic mood. Two great Jacobite plots, closely connected, which
had been concocted during the previous summer, had been discovered.
These were Berwick's plot for a general insurrection of the Jacobites
and for an invasion from France; and a plot concocted at St. Germains,
intrusted to Barclay, for the assassination of William on his road from
Kensington to Richmond. Invasion and assassination are the two
forms of conspiracy which the English people cannot bear; and the
full discovery of these schemes, with the proved certainty that both
Louis and James were fully conscious of all their atrocious details,
roused the nation for an instant to an unusual unanimity of enthusiasm,
and enabled Parliament to set on foot a great association, signed
by hundreds of thousands, who pledged themselves to stand by the
King, to support the war, and to pursue with vengeance any attempt
upon his life. Good tempered and loyal though the people were the
crisis was a fearful one. The operations of the mint were very slow.
£4,000,000 of the old coinage lay melted in the treasury vaults. As
yet scarcely any new silver had appeared. Money was not to be had
either for trade or for private payments. Large employers somehow
contrived, with a certain quantity of the old coinage which had
not been clipped, to pay the wages. But the greater part of England
lived on credit; and it is probable that even thus the crisis would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
scarcely have been got over, had it not been for an expedient of
Montague's, who issued Government securities, bearing interest at
threepence a day on £100. These are what are known now as
Exchequer bills, and form a floating debt due by Government. They
were eagerly used, and with the paper issues of the Bank and the
free use of cheques and credit by all, the dangerous time was tided
over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's want of money.</div>

<p>But the most alarming feature was not the difficulty in the
commercial world, but the difficulty felt by Government and by the
King himself in provisioning the troops and carrying on the war. In
the midst of the commercial crisis the Bank of England had met with
great difficulties; the goldsmiths, who had always hated their great
rival, took the opportunity of attempting to destroy it by villanous
means, they bought up all the Bank paper on which they could lay hands,
and suddenly bringing it forward, demanded immediate payment. The
Bank directors with great courage gained time by refusing to pay the
nefarious claim, and referring their enemies to the courts of law. By
means of calls on their subscribers they continued to pay by far the
greater part of the private and just claims upon them, but they did not
appear to be in a position to assist the King when he suddenly wrote
home to say that £200,000 were absolutely necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Land Bank a failure.</div>

<p>William had hoped that his wants would have been met by the
establishment, in accordance with a favourite plan of the Tories, of
a Land Bank, as a rival to the Bank of England. This somewhat absurd
scheme had been invented by a projector of the name of Chamberlain, who
supposed that every proprietor of land possessing that security ought
to have the disposal of at least as much money as his land was worth,
and therefore suggested a bank which should lend money entirely upon
landed security, overlooking the difficulty that land is not always
at hand and payable on demand as money is. Harley, the representative
of the Tories, now offered to advance the Government £2,500,000 at 7
per cent. The payment of his interest was to be secured by a tax upon
salt. If half that sum should be subscribed before August, and half of
that half paid up, the subscribers were to be incorporated as the Land
Bank. This Bank was expressly intended to suit the wants of the country
gentry, and to injure the moneyed interest. The company was therefore
bound to lend no money but on mortgage, and to lend on mortgage at least
half a million a year. It was not allowed to receive more than 3½ per cent.
interest on these mortgages. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
as the ordinary rate of interest on mortgages was nearly 7 per cent.
it was plain that no capitalist would lend his money at half of the
ordinary profits. It might have been plain also that the landed gentry
whose chief object was to borrow were not likely to lend. It was not
therefore very obvious where the capital was to come from. The King,
however, hoping to obtain money on easy terms, headed the list of
subscribers with £5000. When the Land Bank was called upon to advance
its promised loan, it was found that the whole subscriptions consisted
of no more than £6200. So eager was the Government for money, that it
offered to give the Bank its charter in exchange for a loan of £40,000
only, but the subscriptions never rose beyond £7500, and the scheme
proved completely abortive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bank of England supplies the money. Aug.
15.</div>

<p>The King was compelled therefore to apply to the Bank of England,
which by his patronage of the Land Bank he had done his best to injure.
True to their political creed, a full court of subscribers consented
to advance the necessary £200,000, without one dissentient voice. The
Government was saved, and the connection between the Bank of England
and the Whig party sealed for ever. Meanwhile, Newton's efforts as
Master of the Mint had been ultimately successful. Provincial mints had
been established, and from them and from the mint in London £120,000
of coin was turned out every day. By August the crisis was over, and a
period of unbroken commercial prosperity began.</p>

<p>But although marks of commercial prosperity were already
visible, the financial difficulty was not entirely over. When
William, who had been abroad during the worst of the difficulty,
opened Parliament upon his return (Oct. 20), he had to confess
that, although the crisis had passed without disturbance in England
or great disaster abroad, there was still need for some exhibition
of continued firmness on the part of Parliament. In fact, the
plan of reducing the standard of the coin was so plausible, and had
impressed itself so deeply on the ignorance of the masses, that a
very large party both in and out of Parliament were still anxious to
have recourse to that step, and till all chance of such a measure was
gone no speculators were willing to put the new money in circulation,
and it was constantly hoarded. Consequently a scarcity of money
still prevailed; and not only in England, but throughout Europe,
there was a very general feeling that England was ruined, that the
source of wealth which had hitherto supplied the European coalition
with the means of war was dried up, and that peace was inevitable.
But in the midst of these difficulties the triumph of the Whigs was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[853]</a></span>
complete. The Parliament stood firm, and carried by a triumphant
<span class="sidenote">Credit of England restored.</span> majority
three resolutions, which destroyed all the hopes of the enemies of
England. First, that the Commons would assist the King to prosecute
the war with vigour; secondly, that under no circumstances should the
standard of money be changed; thirdly, the Parliament pledged itself to
make good the deficiencies in Parliamentary funds established since the
King's accession. The first promise was at once abundantly fulfilled
by munificent grants for the war; the second caused the immediate
production of the hoarded coin; while upon the third was framed
Montague's plan known by the name of the General Mortgage. Taxes set
apart to meet the interest of various loans had proved insufficient.
The deficit was no less than £5,160,000. It was now ordered that,
should the proceeds of the old funds and new taxes now set aside for
the purpose prove insufficient, the general funds of the country should
be charged with the liquidation of the debts. By such means as these
the credit of the country was finally re-established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Assassination plot.</div>

<p>The discovery of the Assassination plot, and the enthusiasm to
which it gave rise, has been already alluded to. It was
one of two Jacobite conspiracies, matured in the middle
of the crisis, when it was a common belief that the Government would
never be able to pass securely through the dangers which surrounded it.
One of these conspiracies was for a general rising of the Jacobites
and a simultaneous invasion of England from France. The completion
of this plot was intrusted to James's natural son, the Duke of
Berwick, and in it, had it been carried out, would have been involved
all the best of the Jacobite gentry of England. But side by side
with it was a baser conspiracy, among the more unprincipled and
desperate friends of James, for the assassination of the King. The
management of this conspiracy, which is known by the name of the
Assassination Plot, was intrusted to Sir George Barclay, a Scotch
refugee. It seems certain that the scheme was sanctioned by James
himself, as Barclay was sent over with a few select followers and a
considerable sum of money, authorised to do any acts of hostility
which might conduce to the service of the King. It was also
certainly known to the Duke of Berwick, who was informed of every
step in its progress. He was too honourable himself to take a
declared part in it, but did not feel called upon in any way to interfere
in the matter. His own mission proved unsuccessful. The
English Jacobites were willing to rise, but not till a French army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[854]</a></span>
appeared in the country. On the other hand, Berwick could only assure
them that, after the failures which had already taken place, no French
army would enter the country till the Jacobites were actually in arms.
On this point the negotiations broke down, and Berwick, unwilling to
be mixed up with the darker schemes of Barclay, hastened to leave
England before the fatal day should arrive. This day, the 15th of
February, had been already fixed. Barclay had succeeded in collecting
about forty men, some supplied from France, some English Jacobites
of desperate character. With these it was determined to assault the
King on his return from hunting in Richmond Forest. Every Saturday
he was in the habit of going thither, crossing the Thames by boat
near Turnham Green. The spot chosen was a narrow swampy lane leading
up from the river. But, just before the time fixed, William received
from Portland information that there was a design upon his life. He
was induced to postpone his hunting, although he gave little faith
to the information, which had been received from most untrustworthy
sources. But in the course of the following week fresh information was
brought by a gentleman of the name of Pendergrass, who was known to be
an honourable man. Every precaution was taken to allay the suspicions
of the conspirators, and on the very day when the attempt should have
been made several of the leaders were arrested. The troops were set in
motion, the Lord Lieutenant of Kent repaired to his county, and Russell
hastened to take command of the fleet to oppose the intended invasion.
French troops had been already collected at Calais, and Louis, who had
been informed of the scheme, though he had not actually authorized it,
had determined to take advantage of the opportunity its success would
offer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excitement in the country. Feb. 24.</div>

<p>The measures taken proved sufficient. When the King went in state
to Parliament, and explained what had been done, the enthusiasm of the
House was roused. Two Bills were rapidly passed, the one suspending the
Habeas Corpus Act, the other ordering that the Parliament should not be
dissolved by the death of William, and an association was set on foot
by which the House of Commons bound itself to stand by King William,
to avenge his murder, and to support the order of succession settled
by the Bill of Rights. Throughout the country the feeling excited was
very strong. Means were taken in all the cities of England to search
thoroughly for conspirators, the house of one of them was razed to the
ground by the populace, and one after the other most of them
were captured. Three of them, Charnock, King and Keyes, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span>
brought to trial. Only a few months before, a Bill which had
<span class="sidenote">Arrest and execution of the conspirators.</span>
occupied the public attention through several sessions had received the
royal assent. By this the procedure in the case of trials for treason
had been changed. Before the passing of that Bill a prisoner charged
with treason had not been allowed to see the indictment before he was
brought to the bar. He could not put his witnesses upon oath, nor
compel their attendance, nor was he allowed the service of counsel,
while the Crown enjoyed all the advantages of which he was deprived.
The Bill enacted that all the above-named disabilities should be
removed. The opposition to this Bill had been grounded chiefly upon the
advantage it appeared to give to traitors at a time when the Government
was notoriously open to their attacks; and Parliament had, by way of
compromise, postponed till the 25th of March 1696 (at that time the
beginning of the new year) the operation of the Act. The prisoners
claimed, not without some show of reason, a postponement of the
trial till that date. But their request was overruled, the trial was
proceeded with at once, and they were all condemned and executed (March
24).</p>

<p>But, by the witness of two of the informers, Porter and Goodman,
a more important person had been implicated, if not in the present
<span class="sidenote">Trial of Sir John Fenwick. Aug.</span>
plot, yet at least in one of a similar nature which had been set on
foot immediately after the Queen's death. This was Sir John Fenwick, a
man highly connected, who had brought himself prominently forward as a
Jacobite intriguer, and had earned the personal dislike of William by
a public insult to the Queen. By the law of Edward VI. two witnesses
were necessary to prove the guilt of treason, and Fenwick's chief
hopes lay in his being able to bribe either Porter or Goodman to leave
the country. His first attempt on Porter failed. Porter informed the
Government, received the money, and gave up the agent who offered
it him. Fenwick then attempted to gain time by making a confession.
This was drawn up with great art: while none of the real facts were
brought to light, accusations, only too well founded upon fact, were
brought against Marlborough, Godolphin, Russell, and Shrewsbury. It was
asserted that Marlborough had promised to bring over the army, Russell
the navy, while Godolphin only held office by the leave of the exiled
King. William, with great wisdom, although he knew how much truth there
was in these accusations, absolutely ignored them, and ordered the
trial of Fenwick to be proceeded with without delay. But some
of the contents of the confession became known, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[856]</a></span>
Whigs decided that, for the honour of the party, it could not be passed
over in silence. Godolphin, the last remaining Tory in the Government,
they would have been unwilling to acquit; he was induced to resign,
and the course was now clear. It was of the highest importance that a
real confession should be got from Fenwick, but this he now refused to
give, as he had just received information that his agents had contrived
to get Goodman, the second witness against him, out of the country.
Exasperated by seeing, as they thought, the enemy, who had tried to
undermine the character of their chiefs, slipping from their grasp, the
Whigs brought the question before the House. The confession was voted
false and scandalous, and rather than let their victim escape, in the
heat of their anger, they determined to have recourse to the dangerous
expedient of a Bill of Attainder (Nov. 13). This attempt, which, as
it superseded the law of the land by an exercise of the power of
Parliament, had an unconstitutional and revengeful appearance, met with
the strongest opposition, but was carried in the Lower House by a small
majority. The question became one of party, and finally, after a long
struggle, it passed the House of Lords by a majority of only seven.
Great interest was made for the prisoner, <span class="sidenote">His
execution. Jan. 28, 1697.</span> but William refused to listen to any
request for pardon, and Fenwick was executed. William's inflexibility
is better explained by his desire to shield the Whig party, whom
Fenwick would certainly have accused during his trial, than by the
supposed existence of a personal hostility between himself and his
prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_COMPLETE_TRIUMPH_OF_WHIGS" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_COMPLETE_TRIUMPH_OF_WHIGS"></a>Complete triumph of the Whigs. April 16.</div>

<p>This troublesome business having been got rid of, the session closed
in complete triumph for the Whigs, among whose leaders promotions were
freely distributed. Somers was raised to the Peerage and made Lord
Chancellor, Russell became Earl of Orford, and Montague became First
Lord of the Treasury. This triumph of the party reached its climax in
the course of the year, when the war was brought to an end, and the
policy of William and the Whigs vindicated by the signature of the
Peace of Ryswick.</p>

<p>During the critical year 1696 want of money had paralyzed the
action of both armies in the Netherlands, the destruction of the
<span class="sidenote">Louis desires peace.</span> French magazines at
Givet had rendered it difficult for Louis to maintain his troops, while
William, though England was by no means exhausted as France was, was as
completely hampered by the want of ready money. Louis had indeed in the
course of the year made overtures for peace, but the improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>
in his prospects, caused by the conduct of the Duke of Savoy,
who had deserted the coalition, joined his army to the French under
Marshal Catinat, and successfully insisted that Austria and Spain
should declare the neutralization of Italy, had induced him to
recede from one of the fundamental conditions of peace&mdash;the recognition
of William as King of England. The negotiations had been broken off,
but succeeding events induced Louis, in 1697, to renew his proposals.
The Assassination Plot had failed; William was more popular and better
supported than he had ever been; the country had passed successfully
through its period of crisis, had emerged more powerful than ever and
more determined to support the war, and the great French military
project for the capture of Brussels had been thwarted by the rapidity
of William's movements. Louis therefore now, for the first time in
his life, offered reasonable terms, consenting to resign many of the
conquests he had made during the war, to give back Lorraine to its
Duke, Luxemburg to Spain, Strasburg to the Empire, and to acknowledge
the King of England. William, <span class="sidenote">Opposition of the
coalition.</span> who was never carried away even by his most impetuous
feelings, much as he hated France, at once recognized the justice
of these offers and the wisdom of accepting them. He found however
much difficulty in managing the coalition. The two great powers who
had done the least to support the war now did all in their power to
frustrate the pacification. Spain, moved by a foolish vanity little
suitable to its weak condition, made demands which it was impossible
that Louis should grant, while the Emperor, moved by selfish policy,
would have been only too glad to continue a war, carried on chiefly
at the cost of England, till the death of the Spanish King, which was
every day expected. He would then, he imagined, be able to secure by
means of the European coalition his succession to that monarchy. At
length, after many difficulties, plenipotentiaries from France and the
coalition were assembled (March 1697), the one party at the Hague,
the other at Delft, and conferences were held at Ryswick, which lies
nearly equidistant between these two towns. But the ceremonies of
diplomacy, the ridiculous details of precedence, seemed to promise
that the negotiations would be dragged out to an interminable length.
William was not to be so treated. Having made up his mind that peace
was desirable and that the terms offered were fair, he was determined
that the peace should be speedily made. While the plenipotentiaries
were wasting their time at Ryswick, a series of private meetings
took place between Portland and Marshal Boufflers, between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>
armies, a few miles from Brussels. A few meetings sufficed to
<span class="sidenote">Terms of peace.</span> settle the terms, which
were reduced to writing on the 6th of July. Beyond the general terms
of treaty already offered by France, some personal questions between
William and Louis had to be settled. A mutual promise was exchanged
that neither king would countenance assaults upon the other. William
was to be acknowledged as King of England, and the Princess Anne as
his successor. Mary of Modena was to receive whatever sum of money the
English Law Courts held to be her due; and though Louis, with his usual
magnanimity, refused to stipulate that James should leave France, it
was understood that he should withdraw either to Avignon or to Italy.
Spain and the Emperor still refused to accept the proffered terms.
Louis declared that, unless they were accepted by the 21st of August,
he should no longer hold himself bound by them. The day passed, and,
as was to be expected, the French King raised fresh demands; he would
no longer surrender Strasburg. But the opposition of Spain had already
been crushed. The disasters of the year had brought that country to
reason; Vendome had captured Barcelona, and a French fleet, joined by
the buccaneers of the West Indies, had taken and sacked Carthagena.
William therefore, though much vexed at the obstinacy of the Emperor,
which involved the loss of Strasburg, found himself able to accept
the new terms, in concert with all the great powers of the coalition,
with the exception of the Emperor, and at length, on the 10th of
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Ryswick. Sept. 10.</span> September,
a treaty was concluded between France, Holland, Spain and England.
France surrendered all the conquests made since the Treaty of Nimeguen,
and placed the chief fortresses of the Low Countries in the hands of
Dutch garrisons; William was recognized as King of England, Anne as
his successor, and all assistance was withdrawn from James. A month
later the Emperor also consented to treat. By this second treaty all
the towns acquired since the Peace of Nimeguen, with the exception of
Strasburg, were restored, together with Fribourg, Brissac, Philipsburg,
and all French fortifications on the right bank of the Rhine. Lorraine
was restored to its Duke, Leopold, who granted however a passage
through his dominions for French troops. The Elector of Cologne
was recognized, and the rights of the Duchess of Orleans upon the
Palatinate compromised for money. William and the European coalition
were thus triumphant. Louis had for the first time to withdraw to his
own boundaries, and the succession of England was secured.
At the same time France gained what had now become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span>
absolutely necessary, time to recruit her strength, and leisure to
prepare for that great struggle which all men saw to be imminent,
when the death of Charles II. of Spain, without a direct heir, should
leave the succession of that great monarchy to be disputed among
the various claimants.</p>

<p>The joy of England at the conclusion of the war was enthusiastic.
The King made a triumphal entry into London, and was everywhere
received with enthusiasm. The crowning point of his reign had
been reached. Almost without knowing it, he had solved the great
constitutional question of the time, and, supported by a ministry in
harmony with the Commons, and the national representatives in harmony
with the people, had triumphantly brought to conclusion the great
objects of his life, established the Protestant succession in England,
and proved to Louis the necessity of respecting the rights and feelings
of the rest of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Parliament reduces the standing army.</div>

<p>On the very day after the rejoicings to celebrate the Peace of
Ryswick, on the 3rd of December 1697, the Parliament, which had
hitherto shown itself so firm in support of the Crown, so unanimous and
vigorous in its action, met for its third and last session. William
had every right to expect a period of peace and prosperity. But,
unfortunately, the very success for which England was rejoicing brought
with it the seeds of faction and division. For at once a question had
to be settled, on which the Whig party was itself divided, and on which
the national feeling was on the whole strongly opposed to the King.
The establishment of peace naturally involved the question of the fate
of the great army, numbering more than 80,000 men, which England had
kept up for the last nine years. The nation, suffering heavily from
taxation, was not likely to be willing to continue in peace the efforts
made during war. It was, moreover, a deeply ingrained feeling among the
country gentry of both parties that a standing army in time of peace
was an intolerable evil. The Tories had indeed already adopted the
policy which long marked the party. They would have wished England to
confine itself, even in war, to the pursuit of success upon the sea,
which they regarded as her natural element, and to have withdrawn as
far as possible from all the complications of Continental policy. But,
even setting aside this view, the experience of both parties led them
very naturally to regard an army in time of peace as the inevitable
instrument of tyranny. While the Tories remembered with horror the
triumphant Ironsides of Cromwell, the Whigs recalled with no less detestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>
the importation of Irish troops at the close of the last reign, and
London overawed by the great camp at Hounslow. On the other hand,
William, with his eyes fixed abroad, with a profound mistrust of
France, and certain knowledge of the rapid approach of another great
Continental quarrel, could not bring himself to approve of the breaking
up of an army which he had brought to such perfection. The ministry,
under his immediate influence, and guided by the far-sighted sagacity
of Somers, believed, like the King, in the approach of fresh danger,
and thoroughly disbelieved in the efficacy of half-drilled militia to
withstand such well-trained troops as Louis had always at his disposal.
The national feeling was, however, too strong to be withstood. A
resolution was passed that the number of soldiers should be reduced to
the same amount as had been kept on foot after the peace of Nimeguen,
a resolution which was liberally construed by the Government to mean
10,000. On other points the ministry and the Parliament remained at
one. It was in vain that an attack was directed against William's
lavish grants of Crown lands, in vain that an accusation of peculation
was directed against Montague, it resulted only in a formal declaration
on the part of the Commons of the great services of that statesman.</p>

<p>Montague's success as a financier had indeed reached its culminating
point in this session by the temporary settlement of the question with
regard to the Indian trade which had so long excited the commercial
<span class="sidenote">The East Indian trade.</span> public in
England. It has been incidentally mentioned that the renewal of the
charter to the East India Company in 1693 had produced the fall of
Lord Caermarthen. The Company, originally consisting chiefly of Whigs
and incorporated by royal charter, had, in the hands of Sir Josiah
Child, who exerted an almost dictatorial authority in its management,
allied itself closely to the Tories. Its monopoly had also become
very unpopular, as the increase of capital and the great receipts of
the Indian trade had excited a wish among the mercantile community to
enter more largely upon that branch of traffic. As early as 1691 an
association of its enemies had been formed, which, although it was
not chartered, was commonly spoken of as the new Company, and had
succeeded in obtaining a request from the Parliament to the King that
he would give the old Company the three years' notice of the withdrawal
of its charter which was legally required. An accidental illegality
had in fact just then invalidated the charter. It was to procure its
restoration that, in 1693, Cook, to whom Child had now relinquished much
of his authority, had so lavishly expended the secret service money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_861" id="Page_861">[861]</a></span>
some of which had been traced to Caermarthen. His bribery was
successful. The charter was renewed by the King, but the Parliament,
at the instigation of the new Company, took a different view of the
question, and declared that every man had a right to trade, unless
debarred by Act of Parliament. This declaration of the limits of
the constitutional power of the Crown in matters of trade William
could not venture to oppose. From that time onwards, therefore, the
trade had been legally free, but the power of the Company had been
so great in the Indian seas, and its conduct so oppressive, that it
had been impossible for free traders to carry on their business with
any success. Again, in 1698, the question was strongly pressed upon
the attention of Parliament, and again the old Company found strong
supporters in the Tory party, while the Whigs upheld the demands
of those who wished to participate in its advantages. There was a
division in the views of the opponents of the Company. Some were eager
for perfect freedom of trade, while others joined in the general
feeling of the nation, that, although the present monopoly was a bad
one, some sort of restriction was still necessary. It was understood
that to advance money to Government was the surest way to obtain its
support, and the old Company offered £700,000, at four per cent., as
the price of the renewal of its charter. But Montague, anxious for
money to relieve the embarrassments of the Government, anxious to
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_COALITION_TRIUMPH_OF_RIVAL_EAST_INDIA_COMPANY" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_COALITION_TRIUMPH_OF_RIVAL_EAST_INDIA_COMPANY"></a>Formation of the General East India Company.
1698.</span> establish a second great Whig society of capitalists, who
would support him as the Bank had already done, believed that he saw
his way to gaining those ends by opposing the Company, and brought
forward a plan by which he hoped to secure the support of both sections
of its opponents. He suggested the formation of a company, to be called
the General Company, and proposed that a loan of £2,000,000, at eight
per cent., should be advanced to Government, and that the subscribers
should receive the monopoly of the Indian trade, but be free from the
obligation of trading as a joint-stock society, unless they should
afterwards wish it. He carried the Bill for its formation through
Parliament, and, in spite of the forebodings of his enemies, found that
the immense sum which had been promised was readily subscribed in two
or three days. The Bill was carried on the 3rd of September, but, on
the 5th of the same month, the greater part of the subscribers declared
their desire to become a joint-stock company, which was therefore
chartered by Act of Parliament by the title of the English Company
trading to the East Indies. The struggle between the companies was
found to be so destructive to English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_862" id="Page_862">[862]</a></span>
trade, that, in 1702, arrangements for their union were made. A
<span class="sidenote">The two Companies united. 1708.</span> common
court of managers was established, their stocks equalized, and trade
carried on under the name of the United Company of Merchants trading to
the East Indies. But each company still traded with its own separate
stock. Many inconveniences still attended this division of interests,
and at last, in 1708, upon the award of Lord Godolphin, a final and
complete union was made; and, as the separate adventurers who had not
joined either company were bought out, the monopoly again fell into
the hands of the great United Company. But though his plan was thus
ultimately a failure, for the moment Montague had all the credit of
another great financial triumph, and the Whig party might reasonably
expect that, in spite of the one single defeat with regard to the
standing army, their position would be as good in the new Parliament as
it had been in that which was just closing.</p>


<div class="sidenote">William's attention directed to the Spanish
succession.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the King's personal attention had been as usual directed
rather to foreign than to home politics. The great question which at
once occupied the minds of diplomatists after the Peace of Ryswick
was the succession to the throne of Spain. It seemed very improbable
that Charles II., a miserable hypochondriac, should live much longer.
At his death there threatened to be a general scramble for his vast
possessions. Early in the year, an embassy of unusual grandeur had
attended Portland to France. The question had been there opened, and a
corresponding French embassy under Tallard had subsequently and with
the same object been sent to London. On the dissolution of Parliament
the scene of negotiation was transferred to Holland. The
question was one of great intricacy and difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was not easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_863" id="Page_863">[863]</a></span>
to point out the legitimate successor, even had it been possible to
allow the Spanish monarchy to pass unbroken into the hands of any
of the claimants. The eldest of Charles's sisters had married Louis
XIV., a younger sister had married Leopold of Germany. Leopold
was himself Charles's first cousin, grandson of Philip III. In direct
descent, therefore, the Dauphin stood next to the Spanish king.
Next to him came the offspring of Leopold's first marriage with the
Spanish Princess, namely, the Electress of Bavaria, but she gave over
her right to her son, the Electoral Prince. The third in order was
the Emperor Leopold. But the marriage of the Infanta with Louis
had been accompanied by a formal renunciation of her rights, sanctioned
by the Cortes. The marriage of the second Princess with
Leopold had been attended by a similar renunciation, not sanctioned
by the Cortes. The marriage of Leopold's mother with the Emperor
had been attended by no renunciation at all. Thus, if the renunciations
were valid, the claims in accordance with them came in exactly
the opposite order to the claims by order of descent. But the change
in the balance of Europe involved in the accession to the throne of
Spain of a prince of either the imperial house of Germany or the
royal house of France was of far graver importance than the mere
legal rights to the throne. Both Leopold and the Dauphin, conscious
that Europe would not submit to their acquiring Spain for themselves,
had handed on their claims to representatives, who might be
considered as comparatively harmless. Leopold had substituted for
himself the Archduke Charles, his son by a second marriage, the
Dauphin his second son Philip. But, in spite of this arrangement,
France, England and Holland had considered it dangerous that the
Spanish dominions should pass entire into the hands of either of the
claimants, and the negotiations of this year were directed to forming
a plan for dividing them with some sort of equality among the
<span class="sidenote">First Partition Treaty.</span>
three. The product of these negotiations was the First
Partition Treaty, definitively signed at the Hague on
the 11th of October. By this the bulk of the Spanish dominions&mdash;Spain,
the Indies, and the Netherlands&mdash;was to pass to the least
powerful of the three claimants, the Electoral Prince. France was to
receive Guipuscoa in the north of Spain, and the Two Sicilies; the
Austrian competitor was to be satisfied with the Milanese. The
treaty had been arranged as quietly as possible, but the republican
institutions of Holland were not favourable to secresy. Rumours of
what had been done reached Spain. The desire of the King and
the Castilians was to preserve at all hazards the integrity of the Empire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864">[864]</a></span>
Charles was therefore persuaded to make a will, and to declare that
candidate whom France and England seemed most to favour, namely,
the Electoral Prince, heir to his whole dominions; and thus for a
time the matter rested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Parliament. Tory reaction. Dec. 6, 1698.</div>

<p>Having thus temporarily settled his position abroad, William
returned to England with the hope of a peaceful session. The hope was
singularly falsified by the event. The great Whig party, so noble and
united in adversity, had fallen to pieces, and a Tory reaction begun.
The greatness and success of its measures had left room for faction.
The unpopularity both of William and Montague afforded opportunity for
the attacks of malcontents. On the assembling of Parliament after the
new elections (Dec. 6, 1698), it became evident that a large number of
unknown men who had been elected, although nominally Whigs, intended to
make common cause with the extreme Tories, and that <span class="sidenote">The Country Party.</span>
this united faction, under the title of the Country Party, would form
an opposition against the Crown. The last session had already marked
out the lines this opposition would take. The points at issue would be
the maintenance of the army, the distribution of Crown grants, and the
conduct of individual members of the ministry. On the first of these
points the King did not act wisely. Unable to understand the insular
politics in favour with the English, he insisted that the ministry
should propose a standing army of 20,000 men. Afraid to introduce a
Bill which they knew they could not carry, the ministry suffered the
initiative to slip from their grasp, and a private individual was
allowed to propose that the number of troops should be further lessened
to 7000, and that all those 7000 should be born Englishmen. In spite of
the efforts of the<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_NINETYNINE_WILLIAMS_GRIEF_AT_THE_DISMISSAL" id="SIXTEEN_NINETYNINE_WILLIAMS_GRIEF_AT_THE_DISMISSAL"></a>Dismissal of the Dutch guards.</span>
ministry the Bill was carried, and William found himself compelled to
order the departure of his favourite Dutch guards. Hurt to the quick,
he seriously formed the intention of quitting England. He even drew
up his farewell speech, and was only moved to remain by the earnest
prayers of Somers and by his own returning wisdom.</p>

<p>Assured of their majority, the Opposition proceeded to attack the
late ministry. Their favourite object was Montague, who had laid
himself open to their assaults by the pride and luxury which he had
exhibited in his good fortune, and still more by the indecent rapacity
with which he seized on the valuable place of the Auditorship of the
Exchequer, worth at least £4000 a year; this he placed in the hands
of his brother, to be held until he should want it. The next victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865" id="Page_865">[865]</a></span>
was Russell, Lord Orford, whose administration only escaped censure by
a single vote. And before the session closed, the third point, that of
grants of Crown lands, was touched upon in a way which produced much
after disaster. The method used on this occasion illustrates a point
<span class="sidenote">Rivalry between the two Houses.</span> deserving
of notice. The Revolution had placed the supreme power in the hands
of Parliament; but Parliament itself consists of two elements, of
two Houses drawn from different classes. Besides the general party
struggles, besides the frequent contests between King and Parliament,
and subsequently between Parliament and people, there was therefore a
class rivalry between the two Houses, which had shown itself already
on more than one occasion during the reign, and was rendered more
prominent now by the fact that the party feeling in the Upper House
was on the whole decidedly Whig. The weapon which the Commons intended
to use in this strife was their exclusive right of introducing money
Bills. Those Bills the Upper House had the power of rejecting entire,
but not of amending. The Commons now "tacked" or appended to the Bill
for the Land Tax a clause appointing seven Commissioners to inquire
into the manner in which the forfeited land in Ireland had been granted
out. This obnoxious clause the Lords were compelled to pass, or to
reject the Bill entirely, and thus stop the supplies. Though keenly
feeling the coercion put upon them, by a plan which would have proved
fatal to the Upper House had not the good feeling of the nation and the
strength of popular opinion ultimately compelled the Commons to abandon
it, the Lords passed the Bill, feeling probably that the present
occasion was scarcely important enough for a great constitutional
struggle. The Money Bill having been passed, the King, in some anger,
prorogued the Parliament (May 4).</p>

<p>As usual, when Parliament was not sitting, William withdrew to
Holland, a habit which, now that the war no longer necessitated his
presence there, increased his unpopularity in England, and the session
of Parliament which he returned to meet in November 1699 was still more
stormy than the last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Darien scheme.</div>

<p>The discontent in England was backed up by more serious discontent
in Scotland. The whole of that nation might be now reckoned among
the enemies of the Court. For, during the recess, on the 5th of October,
certain news had reached England of the failure of the great Darien scheme,
and the complete destruction of those wild hopes of wealth and greatness
which had been for the last four years buoying up the Scotch nation. Paterson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866">[866]</a></span>
the same man whose scheme for the Bank of England had in the hands of
Montague proved so successful, was the originator of this disastrous
project. He had persuaded himself that the natural wealth of a country
has nothing to do with its prosperity. The commercial cities of the
ancient world, and Venice and Holland in modern times, had risen to
greatness and wealth without any territorial possessions of importance.
He believed that he could reproduce this phenomenon in the case of
Scotland. The scheme of Columbus had been to introduce the wealth of
the East by a short and direct route into Europe, and thus to destroy
the traffic of the Venetians. He had found his plan thwarted by the
interposition of America; and the discovery of a passage round the Cape
of Good Hope had turned all men's attention in that direction, and had
been the great source of wealth both to the Dutch and Portuguese. But
the plan of Columbus had never been quite forgotten, and Paterson now
thought to renew it by establishing a line of communication across the
Isthmus of Darien. The Scotch were to colonize and occupy the isthmus,
which would become, in the view of the projector, the great emporium of
the whole Eastern trade. Although he did not explain the details of his
scheme, it was listened to with enthusiasm by his fellow-countrymen;
and in 1695, an extraordinary Act passed the Scotch Parliament, and
received the assent of the Lord High Commissioner, authorising the
formation of a Corporation, half the capital of which was to be held
by Scotchmen, with the monopoly of the trade with Asia, Africa, and
America for thirty-one years. With the exception of foreign sugar
and tobacco, all its imports were to be duty free. Every servant of
the Company was free from imprisonment and arrest. The Company was
authorized to take possession of unoccupied territories and exercise
legal rights, and the King promised to obtain satisfaction at the
public charge if foreign powers assaulted it. Subscriptions to the
amount of £200,000 and upwards were speedily forthcoming, and a branch
of the Company established itself in London. There, however, the
absurdities of the plan were at once discovered, and it met with a very
cold reception. Any colony, to be useful, must be either in America
or in the Spice Islands; now interference in America would not be
tolerated by Spain, nor would Holland look on quietly at the occupation
of the Spice Islands; a maritime war was in fact inevitable; Scotland,
singlehanded, could scarcely hope to carry on such a war, and England
would almost infallibly be drawn into it, and this on
behalf of a Company which, by changing Scotland into a free port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867">[867]</a></span>
would virtually make it an enormous centre for smuggling to the extreme
detriment of English trade. The attention of the King was drawn to
the subject. He expressed his entire disapprobation of the scheme,
and dismissed the Lord High Commissioner and the Secretary; but the
law was made and could not be rescinded. In 1698, in the midst of
wild enthusiasm, 1200 colonists set out from Leith, with Paterson
among them, and reached Darien in safety, and there established their
colony, but almost immediately came into contact with the neighbouring
Spanish governor, and the inevitable war began. At first, however, the
reports were favourable, and in the following year a new armament of
four ships and 1800 colonists left Scotland for Caledonia, as the new
settlement was called. They had not been gone long before news arrived
at New York that the colony no longer existed, and that the wretched
remnant of its inhabitants had sought refuge in New England. In fact,
the climate had proved eminently unhealthy, in spite of the assertions
of Paterson. Provisions had failed, and, worn out and enfeebled, the
colonists, feeling themselves entirely unable to repell the assaults
of Spain, determined to withdraw. After miserable suffering, a few of
them reached New York, and the second expedition arrived in Caledonia
to find only uninhabited ruins. They determined upon reoccupying
these, rebuilt the fort, and during the few healthy months continued,
though with heavy losses, to carry out their operations. But before
long a Spanish fleet appeared before the town, and an army, marching
across the isthmus from Panama, blockaded it on the land side.
Resistance was impossible. Already 300 of the new-comers had died,
the survivors promised to depart within a fortnight, and on the 11th
of April left the colony for ever. The disaster was regarded by the
Scotch as a national injury on the part of England. The Company had
throughout excited great anger in the Southern kingdom; the colonial
governors had done all they could to discourage the colony when it
arrived, and the Scotch were ready to trace this opposition to national
jealousy,&mdash;to attribute it even to William's partiality for his
Dutch subjects, whose trade might have been injured. In truth, the
whole business was a proof, as William pointed out to the House of
Lords, of the difficulty of managing two countries with different
interests under one Crown, and the necessity of a closer union between
the nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Parliament Nov. 16, 1699.</div>

<p>It was thus, supported by the discontent of Scotland, that the malcontents
of Parliament resumed the question of the management
of the royal property. After a fruitless attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_868" id="Page_868">[868]</a></span>
upon Somers, who had indeed received a grant, but one against which
no reasonable complaint could be made, they proceeded to follow up
the work of the last session, and to act upon the recommendation of
the seven Commissioners who had been appointed by the tacked clause
of the preceding session. The Crown lands had been constantly dealt
<span class="sidenote">Irish forfeitures.</span> with according to the
King's pleasure, without parliamentary interference. In early times,
however, they had been regarded as a trust. Parliament had frequently
demanded that the King should live upon his own revenues, and Acts
for the resumption of grants had been passed, the last being that
immediately following the battle of Bosworth. Since then the gift
of the Crown had been considered a perfectly sound title. Whatever
dislike, therefore, William's lavish grants to his Dutch favourites
had excited, there would have been very great difficulty in calling
in question his right to make them. The use to which the forfeited
lands which had fallen into William's hands after the Pacification
of Limerick had been put was more open to objection. A Bill ordering
them to be applied to the public service had been interrupted and left
incomplete, and the King had promised that the Commons should have
another opportunity of considering the question. As they had since
taken no steps in the matter, he seems to have considered himself
free to act as he pleased. Of the forfeited lands, which amounted
to about 1,700,000 acres, a fourth had been restored to its ancient
possessors, according to the Limerick Pacification. Some of the rest
had been mercifully given back to Irishmen, some to men like Ginkel and
Galway, who had distinguished themselves in the Irish wars, but by far
the larger portion had fallen to the King's personal friends, such as
Woodstock, the eldest son of Portland, and Keppel, Lord Albemarle. The
Commission could not arrive at unanimity, and sent up two reports. But
that of the majority, which was very hostile to Government, was alone
accepted by the Commons. It ridiculously over-estimated the grants at
a sum of, £2,600,000, and at the same time declared that very undue
leniency had been shown to the Irish. Had these grants not been made,
and the confiscations properly exacted, much of the present heavy
taxation, they said, might have been spared. The <span
class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_HUNDRED_THE_RESUMPTION_BILL_PASSED" id="SEVENTEEN_HUNDRED_THE_RESUMPTION_BILL_PASSED"></a>Resumption Bill passed. April 10, 1700.</span>
Commons, longing to be free from taxes and hating the Dutch favourites,
took up the matter with factious warmth, and the Resumption Bill was
passed, vesting all the forfeited lands in the hands of trustees, and
offering large rewards to informers who would point out lands which
ought to have been confiscated. They even, with palpable injustice, included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_869" id="Page_869">[869]</a></span>
in their inquiry lands which had never been forfeited. Expecting
opposition from the Upper House, they again tacked this Bill to the
Land Tax Bill. The Lords now determined upon a struggle. Little as
they liked the Dutch favourites, they could not allow themselves to
be thus overridden. Their opposition was, however, unsuccessful;
the nation felt with the Commons, and foreign affairs had reached
a crisis which rendered peace at home necessary to the King. The
quarrel was pressed so far as to threaten a complete breach between
<span class="sidenote">Parliament prorogued. April 11, 1700.</span>
the Houses, and a fatal blow to the Constitution. By the influence of
the King the Lords were induced to yield, and the triumphant Commons
were passing to fresh assaults on the King's friends, when, having
passed the Land Tax Bill and thus supplied himself with money, William
suddenly prorogued the Houses.</p>

<p>The necessity which had driven him to this step was the reopening
of the question of the Spanish succession. In January 1699 the
Electoral Prince had died. The whole question thus assumed a new
shape, and William's undivided attention was required. For the same
reason, probably, and to allay the opposition in the House, he thought
it necessary to remove Somers from office, and to place the Great
Seal in the hands of Sir Nathan Wright. The Second Partition Treaty,
which the King was now engaged in arranging, was such as was rendered
necessary by the death of the <span class="sidenote">Second Partition
Treaty.</span> third claimant. The bulk of the Spanish dominions was
now to be given to the Archduke. It was to him that now Spain, the
Indies, and the Netherlands were assigned, while Milan, which had
formerly fallen to his share, was to be transferred to France, to be
ultimately exchanged for Lorraine, a German fief, very important to
round off the French dominions. But again these arrangements were
upset. Portocarrero, the Spanish minister, was in the French interest,
and supported by Harcourt, the ablest French diplomatist. By playing
upon national feeling, which was strong against any partition, these
statesmen excited the anger of the Spaniards against William, who had
already incurred their enmity by his fancied support of the Darien
scheme; and Charles was at length impressed with the absolute necessity
of making another will. The events of the late session had given rise
to the belief that William was not really master of England, while the
visible greatness of France seemed to afford the best chance of keeping
the Spanish monarchy undivided; the will was therefore made in favour
of the Dauphin's son Philip, Duke of Anjou, who was declared heir to
the whole of the Spanish dominions. The treaty was not well received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_870" id="Page_870">[870]</a></span>
England. While one party clamoured that too much was given to
France, another complained of the injustice of forestalling the wishes
of the Spanish people, and there was a general feeling of anger at the
secresy with which the treaty had been arranged, a treaty which
might easily draw England into a foreign war, and which had been
concluded entirely without consulting Parliament. This anger
reached its highest point when, in November, the King of Spain died,
and Louis, in defiance of all his treaties, accepted his grandson's great
inheritance. William had determined that the whole responsibility
should lie with himself, trusting in his own diplomatic skill; he had
been beaten at his own arts, and his great treaty was absolutely useless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William's unpopularity.</div>

<p>In fact, there was no time when the King had been so unpopular or
his enemies so strong. Nearly every class, except his own immediate
followers among the Whigs, were alienated from him; the mass of the
people had suffered from heavy taxation, the nobles were sore at the
unwise preference given to foreigners; the whole nation shared in this
feeling, and disliked his constant absences from home; the scandal
of the Irish forfeitures had just been brought to light; the country
gentry remembered with anger the failure of their Land Bank, and saw
with envy the increasing importance of the moneyed interest. One thing
was plain, that nothing could be done with a Parliament so adverse as
the last, with a ministry so powerless as the late holders of power
had <span class="sidenote">New ministry. Dec. 1700.</span> proved.
William therefore dissolved the Parliament, summoning a new one for
the following February; and, freeing himself from the old ministry,
called to his councils Rochester, the late Queen's uncle and the head
of the High Church Tories, with Godolphin and Sir Charles Hedges.
For the present his only hope lay in the possibility of a general
European war; of this as yet there was but little sign. Austria had
indeed refused to acknowledge the new King of Spain, and withdrawn its
ambassador from Madrid, but in other countries it seemed as if the will
of the late Spanish King would be quietly accepted. William himself
could do nothing, and for the time was compelled to submit. His new
ministry entreated him to <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_ONE_NEW_PARLIAMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_ONE_NEW_PARLIAMENT"></a>New Parliament. Feb.
1701.</span> acknowledge Philip; his Parliament showed no disposition
to support him in any hostile steps against France. Two questions which
he placed before them in his opening speech were, the succession of the
throne of England, the settlement to which had been rendered necessary
by the late death of the Duke of Gloucester, the young son of the
Princess Anne (July 29, 1700), and the position which England should assume
in the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871">[871]</a></span>
altered aspect of European politics. It was in vain, upon this latter
point, that he attempted to urge them to energy. The King of France
had driven the Dutch to acknowledge Philip, by suddenly entering the
Low Countries, and capturing 15,000 of their troops who had been
intended to garrison the barrier fortresses. William and the Dutch
States had in vain demanded the withdrawal of the French troops and the
surrender of the strongholds. But even this act of aggression did not
arouse the Parliament to energy. They acknowledged the obligations of
England under the Treaty of 1677, and promised to send succours to the
Dutch, but there seemed no immediate prospect of any grants
for the purpose. Nor was the other point much more <span class="sidenote">Succession Act.</span>
vigorously prosecuted. A Bill of Succession was indeed produced, but
nearly every clause seemed evidently aimed against the King's former
conduct. The new sovereign was not to leave the kingdom without leave
of Parliament; no person not a born Englishman was to be capable of
holding any position of trust, or of receiving any grant from the
Crown. England was not to be engaged in war for the defence of any
dominions not belonging to the Crown of England. All matters relating
to the Government were to be transacted in the Privy Council, and
countersigned by such members of that body as should advise or consent
to them. Having thus secured, as they thought, the insular position
of England, the House proceeded to settle the succession upon the
Electress Sophia of Hanover. Thus, though the Protestant succession was
secured, a Bill which William had hoped would be a singular expression
of popular sympathy with his own efforts was in fact a vote of censure
on many of the acts of his reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impeachments against the Whigs.</div>

<p>While public business was thus proceeding languidly, the whole
energy of the House was directed against the old Whig leaders and
against the House of Lords. Impeachments were hurried on against Lord
Portland, Lord Orford, Lord Somers, and Montague, who had now become
Lord Halifax. Against each of these the main charge was the share they
had taken in the Partition treaties. But, in the case of Portland and
Montague, there were additional charges in reference to the grants and
dilapidations of the royal revenue, for which they were said to be
answerable; while against Somers and Orford was alleged a ridiculous
story concerning their participation in the notorious exploits of
Captain Kidd. This man had been sent out by private enterprise to
destroy piracy in the Indian Sea, and had there himself turned pirate.
Both Somers and Orford had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872">[872]</a></span>
subscribed to the original enterprise. Somers, as Chancellor, had
sealed Kidd's commission. It was now ridiculously suggested that
they had all along known of his piratical intentions. But, while
sending up these impeachments, the Commons felt absolutely certain
that the Whig majority of the Lords would at once acquit their
victims, for it was well understood that the measure was not one of
justice but one of faction; they therefore passed an unjustifiable
address to the King, praying him to dismiss the four Peers from his
Council, even before the impeachments were heard. The House of
Lords produced a counter address. The Commons demanded longer
time to complete their impeachments, but the Peers were determined
to bring a matter on which their judgment was in fact foregone to a
speedy issue, and had now both law and right on their side. They
therefore positively refused to extend the time, and the 17th of June
was fixed for Lord Somers's trial. Westminster Hall was fitted up
with the usual preparations for impeachment. The Lords marched in
all pomp to their judgment-seat. The Commons, declaring they had
been denied justice, refused to appear. There were no accusers, and
Somers was declared acquitted.</p>

<p>But many signs had begun to show themselves in the country which
induced William to believe that the popular opinion was turning,
and he ventured to put an end to the very dangerous fight
<span class="sidenote">The Kentish Petition.</span> between the Houses by
a prorogation (June 24). What is known as the Kentish Petition was
the great sign of this changed feeling. This petition had been sent
up by the Grand Jury of Kent. It hinted that public business had
been neglected, and the pursuit of personal vengeance substituted,
and humbly deprecated the least mistrust of the King, and implored
the House to give effect to its loyal addresses by turning them into
Bills of supply. So arbitrary was the House of Commons at this time
in the assertion of its privilege, that it was only by consenting
to remain outside the House, and be personally answerable for their
document, that the five gentlemen who brought up this petition were
able to get it presented at all (May 8). It raised a storm of anger,
was voted scandalous, infamous and seditious, and the five gentlemen
were dismissed to prison. But their cause was taken up by the whole
Liberal party, and the desires expressed in the petition were
brought before the public in much more forcible language in a
<span class="sidenote">The Legion Memorial.</span> memorial written by Defoe,
and called from its signature "The Legion Memorial." This expression of
opinion could not but have been gratifying to the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873">[873]</a></span></p>

<p>Hope was indeed again opening before him. Not only could he
feel certain of some support, however weak, at home, but the persistent
retention on the part of Louis, in spite of all their clamours,
of the Dutch barrier fortresses and the 15,000 troops he had captured
had begun to rouse the war spirit of that people. Left more free to
act now that Parliament was prorogued, William at once despatched
10,000 troops into Holland, under command of Marlborough, and
before long went thither himself, to lay the foundation of a Grand
<span class="sidenote">The Grand Alliance.</span> Alliance between
England, Holland, and the Emperor. This treaty was completed in
September. But the terms of it proved surely how low William's hopes
still were. It only declared that it was desirable that satisfaction
should be given to the Emperor on account of the succession of Spain,
and pledges given for the security of England and her allies. It
allowed two months for peaceful negotiations. After that time the
contracting powers pledged themselves to attempt the recovery by
force of arms of Milan for Austria, and of the barrier fortresses for
Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of James II.</div>

<p>At this moment James II. of England lay dying. With all Europe
submitting with ill-dissembled dislike to the late acquisition
of Spain by the Bourbons, and ready to take any
opportunity for disturbing the newly-appointed King, to acknowledge,
in contravention of the Treaty of Ryswick, the young Prince of Wales
as King of England, was a step full of danger for the French King. It
could not have been hidden from Louis, as it certainly was not hidden
from his ministers, that the real strength of his present position was
the depressed condition of William, thwarted by his factious Parliament;
and Louis must have known that nothing was more likely to
change that weakness into strength than a violation of the Peace of
Ryswick,&mdash;the destruction of the one great advantage which England
had gained by nine years' expenditure of blood and treasure. But the
<span class="sidenote">Louis acknowledging the Pretender. Sept. 16.</span>
influence of Madame de Maintenon, who had been won over to the interest
of the Stuarts, and a certain theatrical magnanimity which seldom
deserted Louis, proved stronger than prudence. At the deathbed of James
he promised to uphold the claims of his son, and three days afterwards
the young Prince was formally acknowledged by the whole Court as King
of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rouses English patriotism.</div>

<p>No better news could have reached William. Again, as in the time of
his first landing in England, his enemy had done more for him than any
skill or diplomacy of his own could effect. The whole nation burst into
a flame. Patriotic and loyal addresses came pouring in upon him. Public
bodies in all parts of the country passed resolutions full of affection
for him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874">[874]</a></span>
conduct of the late majority was denounced as factious wrangling, and
the cause of the great insult which had been laid on the country; and
the connection between the Tory party and Louis seemed to be rendered
plain when the French ambassador was found seated at supper in a
well-known Jacobite tavern surrounded by the most ardent members of
the Tory party. The King seized the moment of excitement, and, though
conscious of the delays it would entail, at once dissolved Parliament.
A struggle such as has seldom been seen excited England from end to
end, and everywhere it became evident that the reckless conduct of
Louis had secured the restoration of the Whigs. London returned four
Whig members, Wharton again won back his supremacy in Buckingham, even
the virulent Howe was defeated and lost his seat in Gloucestershire.
The flame of indignation still blazed high when William met his new
Parliament <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWO_AND_CHANGES_IN_THE_MINISTRY" id="SEVENTEEN_TWO_AND_CHANGES_IN_THE_MINISTRY"></a>New Parliament and Ministry.</span>
on the last day of the year, and, in words of unusual fire, bade them
drop their factious disputes, and know no other distinction than
that of those who were for the Protestant religion and the present
Establishment, and of those who meant a Popish prince and a French
government. The ministry was largely changed. Godolphin left the
Treasury to make room for Lord Carlisle; Manchester was made Secretary
instead of Hedges, and other Whig Lords were admitted to the Privy
Council. It is true that the unanimity was by no means perfect. The
Tories were still strong in the House. There was still some fear of the
ultimate return of the Stuarts. But the Government was strong enough to
pass a Bill for attainting the pretended Prince of Wales, and a still
more important Bill abjuring the house of Stuart, and pledging those
who took the oath to uphold in turn each successor named in the Act of
Settlement. The acceptance of this oath was made requisite for every
employment either in Church or State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of William.</div>

<p>It was thus in the full flush of a new victory, with hopes high,
and with a well-grounded belief that his life's work of opposition to
the encroachments of the French would not after all be wasted, that
William, broken down by disease and suffering, died. He had long been
so ill that his life had been despaired of, but he was still able to
ride. On the 20th of February, his horse, stepping upon a molehill,
fell with him, and his collar-bone was broken. This accident rendered
his recovery hopeless. He lived just long enough to express his strong
desire for a Union with Scotland, and to appoint the Commission which
gave the royal assent to the Abjuration Act. On the 8th of March,
surrounded by his faithful friends, he breathed his last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power of Marlborough.</div>

<p><span class="first drop">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> passing to a new reign we pass to no new epoch. No new
principles are at work, no new influences visible.
The same constitutional growth which had been gradually
developing itself since the Revolution makes its way steadily
onwards. The sole difference is the difference in the person of the
sovereign. In the yet unfixed state of the Constitution this might
have introduced important changes, and did in fact, by the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876">[876]</a></span>
the strong personal character of William, tend to easier and more
complete development of parliamentary action. But the importance
of the Queen was much neutralized by the complete mastery exercised
over her mind by the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The
effect of Marlborough's supremacy was to reproduce almost exactly
the circumstances of the former reign. Though an immoral politician,
a self-seeking and avaricious man, Marlborough was too great not to
appreciate the grandeur of William's European schemes. Thus, as far
as European policy was concerned, he passed almost completely into
that King's place, pledged both by his natural intellect and by his
personal interests to pursue very much the same course as William
had taken. It is scarcely going beyond the truth to call the earlier
part of Anne's reign the reign of the Duke of Marlborough; and
he encountered exactly the same difficulties, and was reduced to
exactly the same straits, as his predecessor had been in his attempts
to carry out a national policy without regard to party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work of the first
Parliament.</div>

<p>The dissolution of Parliament had followed as a natural consequence
upon the death of the sovereign who had summoned it, and in whom it
was regarded as depending. The new position which the Parliament had
occupied since the Revolution had naturally modified that view. By a
law passed at the beginning of the eighth year of William's reign,
Parliament was allowed to sit for six months after the King's death.
It was therefore with the same Whig Parliament, which had come into
existence just after Louis had acknowledged the Prince of Wales, that
Anne's reign began. The conduct of the Parliament during the few
months of its existence was entirely free from faction. It completed
and applied the Abjuration Bill, on which it had been busy at the end
of the last reign, established an examination of public accounts, and
granted with great unanimity the same revenue as William had enjoyed;
and further, took a first step towards a measure which William had
recommended, and which the failure of the Darien scheme had rendered
almost inevitable, by passing a Bill for appointing Commissioners to
arrange, if possible, for a complete union with Scotland.</p>



<p>But it soon became evident that both the tendencies of the Queen
and Marlborough's views on home politics would lead to the restoration
of Tory influence. On the Duke himself and on his wife honours and
<span class="sidenote">Tory ministry.</span> offices were freely
lavished, and the new ministry was drawn almost entirely from the
Tory party. Thus Godolphin, Marlborough's son-in-law, was made Lord Treasurer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877">[877]</a></span>
Nottingham and Sir Charles Hedges, Secretaries of State; Lord Normanby,
shortly afterwards Duke of Buckingham, Privy Seal; Pembroke, Lord
President; Jersey was given a place in the Council; while offices
were found for Seymour and Levison Gower in the Privy Council, from
which Somers, Halifax, and Orford were excluded. Yet even already
Marlborough's intention in some degree to disregard party was shown
in the retention of some Whigs in office, among others the Duke of
Devonshire, who kept his place as Lord Steward. More important, with
regard to the future history of the reign, was the division which even
thus early began to show itself among the Tories themselves. Rochester,
who had come over from his post in Ireland, not only desired a much
more complete exclusion of the Whigs from office, but also opposed, in
pursuance of the accepted policy of the High Tories, the declaration of
war. Thus already, before the dissolution which took place on the 25th
of May, two facts, which together form the key to the political history
of the reign, were visible,&mdash;Marlborough's determination to rely
upon a mixed Government, and the disinclination of one section of the
Tories to support him in his war policy.</p>

<p>In pursuing the future history of the reign there are three subjects
which require special attention, the European war, the Union with
Scotland, and the parliamentary and ministerial history; and although
the war and the history of the ministry constantly affect one another,
it will probably tend to clearness if, for the first few years at all
events, these three subjects are treated separately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning of the war. May 4, 1702.</div>

<p>The opposition of the Tories to the war had been entirely useless.
The completion of the negotiations set on foot by William had been
intrusted to Marlborough. Immediately, at the beginning of the reign,
he had gone to the Hague, and war was declared in London, at Vienna,
and at the Hague on the 4th of May. Meanwhile so many Princes had
joined the Confederation, originally consisting of England, Holland,
and Austria, that war was declared by the Diet of the Empire. The
Elector of Brandenburg had been induced to join by the promise of
the royal title; the Elector of Hanover and the Elector Palatine had
also given in their adhesion. On the other hand, though the brother
Electors of the Bavarian House, the Elector of Bavaria and the Elector
of Cologne, had at first agreed to remain neutral, Louis felt pretty
sure of the course they would ultimately take, and of the friendship of
Victor Amadeus of Savoy, whose daughter had married the new King of
Spain, and the position of whose dominions rendered his friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878">[878]</a></span>
of great value, giving as it did an access into Italy to the
French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marlborough appointed Commander.</div>

<p>The Queen's love for her husband had induced her to wish that he
should be made Commander-in-chief both of the English and Dutch forces,
though utterly unfit for the post, and Marlborough seems to have
honestly attempted to procure this appointment. But the Dutch would
not hear of it, and ultimately Marlborough took the field in July as
Commander-in-chief, with Overkirk as his Lieutenant commanding the
Dutch troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Holland.</div>

<p>Two points distinguish this war from the preceding one. Hitherto in
all great confederations against the French the Spanish Netherlands had
been in the hands of the confederates, but as Spain was now in close
alliance with France, it became necessary to conquer this part of the
Netherlands. And, secondly, the death of William had been followed by
the complete depression of the house of Nassau in Holland, and the
supremacy of the republican party, which by no means shared in the
late King's hatred to France, and which, from jealousy of all personal
authority, caused the general to be accompanied by field deputies, with
a right of mixing in all councils of war. This was one of the greatest
of Marlborough's difficulties, as the deputies seldom failed to hamper
him, and to throw obstacles in the way of any adventurous plans.
Before Marlborough took the field the campaign had opened. The French
had command of the Spanish Low Countries, of the Duchy of Luxemburg,
and, through the friendship of its Elector, of the territories of the
Elector Clement of Cologne, who was both Archbishop of Cologne and
Bishop of Liège. Both the Rhine and Meuse were thus in their hands and
the fortresses held by their garrisons. The whole southern frontier
of Holland, which left the sea near Ostend, crossed the mouth of
the Scheldt, and cutting off a portion of Brabant, joined the Meuse
somewhat to the north of Venloo, was thus open to them, while by way of
the Rhine they had an opportunity of attacking the Dutch provinces from
the east. While Holland was thus assailable on two sides, the advancing
angle of the French dominions exposed them in a similar manner. The
valley of the Moselle, which leads directly into the heart of Lorraine,
could be attacked either from the north or by a German army coming from
the south by way of Landau. Anxious to secure their frontier towards
the Rhine, the Dutch had early in the year besieged and taken
the fortress of Kaiserwerth, and bent chiefly upon their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_879" id="Page_879">[879]</a></span>
security, would have preferred to retain Marlborough and the army in
the neighbourhood of that river. But the Duke saw that the passage
of the Meuse where it makes the northern frontier of the Dutch
Brabant, and an advance southwards towards the Spanish Netherlands,
would necessitate a concentration of the French troops, and
transfer the seat of war to that province. In spite of the opposition
of the Dutch, he therefore crossed the river at Grave, and proceeded
directly south into Spanish Brabant. As he had expected, his appearance
there obliged Boufflers to withdraw from Guelders to oppose
him; and although the opposition of the field deputies prevented a
general engagement, Marlborough was enabled to secure the eastern
frontier of Holland, to take the fortresses of the Meuse,&mdash;Venloo,
Ruremond, Stevensweerth, and Liège,&mdash;to overrun Guelders, Cleves,
the Electorate of Cologne, with the exception of Bonn, the whole of
the Bishopric of Liège and the Duchy of Limburg, thus cutting off
the French from the Lower Rhine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an attack had been made upon France from the Upper Rhine.
The Margrave Louis of Baden, having crossed the river with the German
forces, found himself opposed by Catinat, who did not show his usual
ability, and suffered the Margrave to besiege and take Landau and
to overrun Alsace. The success of the German army was marred by the
defection of Bavaria, which, throwing aside its neutrality, declared
in favour of France. Villars was detached from Catinat's army to join
the Elector of Bavaria; and as an access was thus opened to the French
into the heart of Germany, Louis of Baden had to withdraw from his
conquests, and, turning to meet the new danger, suffered a heavy defeat
at Friedlingen.</p>

<p>While such was the course of the war in Germany and Flanders, in
Italy, Prince Eugene of Savoy, the general of the allies, had, even
<span class="sidenote">The war in Italy.</span> in the winter, been
carrying on operations against Marshal Villeroi. That Marshal had
been taken prisoner at Cremona, and had been succeeded by Vendome.
A great but indecisive battle had been fought in August at Luzara,
after which the armies were left facing each other, the French still
occupying <span class="sidenote">The war at sea.</span> the Milanese.
The maritime war had been as indecisive as that upon the Continent;
an English expedition under the Duke of Ormond had been sent against
Cadiz; it had failed in its original object, but on the way home had
succeeded in destroying a Spanish treasure fleet in the Bay of Vigo.
In the West Indies, an event occurred almost unprecedented in English
history. The English fleet had been defeated in a great battle, not by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880">[880]</a></span>
superiority of the enemy, but by the treason of its own commanders.
Admiral Benbow, who had engaged a superior force of the enemy, after a
fight of several days, was deserted by some of his captains. Wounded
and dying, he was forced to withdraw. He lived long enough to have his
captains condemned to death by court martial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THREE_SAVOY_AND_PORTUGAL_JOIN" id="SEVENTEEN_THREE_SAVOY_AND_PORTUGAL_JOIN"></a>Savoy and Portugal join the coalition.</div>

<p>The campaign of this year was thus wholly indecisive. The English
and Dutch had secured the possession of the Rhine and the Meuse; but
the German army was threatened in front from Alsace, while its rear
and southern flank were exposed to the victorious army of Villars and
the Elector of Bavaria: in Italy the French still held the Milanese
against the attacks of Prince Eugene. But before the next campaign
opened the position of France had changed considerably for the worse.
The diplomacy of Louis had hitherto secured the predominance of French
influence in both Spain and Italy by the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal
to his cause. Victor Amadeus of Savoy had been won by the marriage
of his daughter with the King of Spain; but, situated in the midst
of great powers, his conduct was almost of necessity shifting, and
his policy directed rather to his own advantage and to the interests
of Italy than to the more general interests of Europe; the offer on
the part of Austria to give up to him the districts of Montferrat and
Novara induced him to desert Louis and to declare in favour of the
Grand Alliance. The French army in the Milanese was thus separated
from France, and its energy paralyzed. By similar means the fidelity
of Portugal was also undermined. A promise of a certain portion of
the Spanish possessions both in Spain and in America, and a treaty
known as the Methuen Treaty, securing to Portugal great advantage in
her trade with England, induced her to join the Grand Alliance. The
importance of this adhesion was great, as it afforded an opening for
the allied armies to act directly against Spain, the possession of
which country was the real object of the war. Nor were these defections
the only causes of danger which beset France. Disturbances had broken
out in Louis' own dominions. The Protestants of the Cevennes, driven
to despair by the cruel conduct of the Intendant, Marshal de Baville,
and of the Catholic clergy, had broken into open rebellion, and the
irregular efforts of the Camissards, as they were called, had become
formidable under the skilful guidance of Cavalier, a baker's lad, who
showed extraordinary aptitude for partisan warfare.</p>

<p>These misfortunes on the part of France were somewhat balanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881">[881]</a></span>
by the defection, already mentioned, of the Elector of Bavaria; and
<span class="sidenote">Campaign of 1703.</span> Louis determined to
take advantage of the road to Vienna thus opened to him, and to throw
his chief efforts in that direction. Thither therefore Villars marched
through the Black Forest, having previously captured the fortress of
Kehl opposite Strasbourg. The movement, however, was only partially
successful; while Villars wished to march upon Vienna, already
threatened by an insurrection in Hungary, the Elector insisted upon
moving into the Tyrol. The peasantry of that mountainous district,
deeply attached to Austria, thwarted all his efforts to advance, and
when Louis of Baden, leaving the lines of Stolhofen, appeared in
Bavaria, the Elector was compelled to withdraw and rejoin Villars. Too
weak to defeat the Margrave, the combined generals were obliged to
content themselves with checking the German troops coming against them
from Franconia under Count Stirum at Hochstädt. Villars, who traced the
ruin of the campaign to the rejection of his advice, clamoured to be
recalled, and his place was but badly filled by Marsin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Marshal Tallard had been repairing last year's disasters
in Alsace. Brisach had been taken, the Prince of Hesse, with troops
from Stolhofen, had been defeated at Spires while attempting to relieve
Landau, and that city had been retaken by the French (Nov. 17). In
Flanders Marlborough had formed a great plan to conquer Antwerp and
Ostend, but had been thwarted by the slowness of the Dutch, and by the
defeat of their army under Opdam at Echeren. The Duke had to content
himself with the capture of Bonn upon the Rhine, and with further
progress upon the Meuse, where he captured Huy and Limburg.</p>

<p>The following year, 1704, saw a change in the ministry at home.
Finding himself thwarted by the extreme High Tories, Marlborough
had obtained their dismissal, and the admission of Harley and St.
John to the ministry. In the meantime Louis was making vast
efforts, and had set on foot no less than eight armies. There was to
be war at once in Flanders, in Bavaria, in Alsace, in Savoy, in
Lombardy, in Spain, and against the Cevennes. To Villars was
intrusted the reduction of the Cevennes, which had been vainly
attempted the preceding year by the Marshal Montreval. The Duke
of Berwick was to subdue Portugal, Vendome to act against Savoy,
Villeroi to stand on the defensive in Flanders, and the great effort
of the year was again to be in Bavaria, where the events of the
preceding year promised fresh success. There a considerable French
army under Marsin had collected, and thither now was proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882">[882]</a></span>
a fresh army under Tallard, which would raise the forces in the country
much beyond anything the Emperor could bring to meet them. Early in May
Marshal Tallard led 15,000 troops through the Black Forest, and formed
his junction with the Elector. He then hastened back to Alsace, where
30,000 men had been left to oppose the Margrave of Baden.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption"><p>The march to BLENHEIM. June to August 1704.</p>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOUR_CRITICAL_POSITION_OF_AUSTRIA" id="SEVENTEEN_FOUR_CRITICAL_POSITION_OF_AUSTRIA"></a>Critical position of Austria.</div>

<p>The position of the Emperor seemed indeed almost hopeless. While the
French and Bavarians were advancing directly towards his capital on the
west, the Hungarians, under Prince Ragotski, with constantly increasing
forces, were approaching Vienna from the east, so that in June it
became necessary to throw up works for the defence of the capital.
Marlborough watched the coming crisis with much anxiety, and formed a
plan of great boldness for the Emperor's relief. It was no less than to
march the whole of the troops under his command, and to transfer the
seat of war to Bavaria, interposing between Vienna and the advancing
Bavarians. Previous experience had taught him that there was no hope
of persuading the Dutch to countenance such a plan. To the States he
therefore suggested only a campaign on the Moselle, and co-operation
with Louis of Baden in the south; to Godolphin alone he told his
secret. At length a threat that he would move upon the Moselle with
the English alone, backed up by the influence of Heinsius, the Grand
Pensionary, who was his constant friend, induced the Dutch to give
their consent to the part of the plan he had disclosed to them. Other
obstacles were <span class="sidenote">The march to Blenheim.</span> met
with from the other allies, but they were all at length overcome, and
early in May Marlborough set out, ostensibly for the Moselle. To keep
up this notion he went first to Coblenz, and the French proceeded to
collect their armies to meet him. He then went on to Mayence, and it
was believed that he intended to act in Alsace. He was there obliged to
disclose his real object. He left the Rhine, marched up the Neckar, and
advanced through the Duchy of Wurtemberg. On his road to Mondelsheim,
he had a meeting with Eugene, who was commanding the Imperial army on
the Rhine. To him he told his plans; and the intercourse of the two
great chiefs ripened into unbroken friendship. They were there also
joined by Louis of Baden, a punctilious German general of some ability,
but belonging to an older school of tactics. Marlborough and Eugene
suggested that the Margrave should retire to his lines at Stolhofen,
and hold them against Tallard, while Eugene should bring such of
the German army as was moveable to co-operate with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883">[883]</a></span>
the English. The Margrave, however, insisted on the place of
honour. Eugene went back to the Rhine, the Margrave joined
Marlborough; and the difficulty of the chief command was compromised,
the generals were to command on alternate days. After making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884">[884]</a></span>
these arrangements, the armies proceeded on their march through
the rough hill country of Wurtemberg. Having crossed the Neckar at
Laufen, they followed the course of its tributaries, by Gross Heppach,
Ebersbach, and the difficult pass of Geislingen, and finally emerged
upon the plains, reaching the Danube at Elchingen, a little to the east
of Ulm. The Elector, expecting an attack upon that city, garrisoned
it and withdrew, still on the north bank of the river, to Dillingen,
further to the east. But Marlborough had no intention of attacking
Ulm, he continued his march eastward, determining to pass round and
beyond the Elector's army and to secure Donauwerth, which would supply
him with a bridge to cross the river, and might be turned into a
fortified place for his magazines. With some difficulty he persuaded
Louis of Baden to march in this direction. His intention being at
length evident, the Elector of Bavaria sent 12,000 men to occupy the
strong hill of the Schellenberg, commanding Donauwerth. When the day
broke, the English army were at Amerdingen, still fourteen miles from
Donauwerth. It was however the day of Marlborough's command. At three
in the morning he started on his march, and afraid of allowing the
opportunity to slip, though his men were weary from their long journey,
Marlborough determined to assault the Schellenberg that same afternoon.
The battle was a fierce one, but the allies were entirely successful.
The Bavarians fled in disorder. Some thousands crossed the bridge,
but the weight of the fugitives broke it down, and a vast number were
drowned in the river. The Elector of Bavaria now withdrew to Augsburg,
to await the arrival of reinforcements from France. Marlborough and his
army crossed the Lech, and proceeded to follow him. Bavaria was at his
mercy. He offered the Elector terms of capitulation. They were however
refused, and Marlborough was guilty of the one act which is a blot on
his military career, he gave the country up to military execution.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img109.jpg" alt="" title="The March to Blenheim" />
</div>

<p>The two French generals Villeroi and Tallard, outwitted by
Marlborough's march, had meanwhile taken counsel together, and
once more Tallard, leaving Villeroi in Alsace, led a reinforcement of
25,000 men to join the Bavarians. He was watched and followed by
Prince Eugene, who reached the Danube at Dillingen almost at the
moment that Tallard had formed his junction with the Bavarians at
Augsburg. As Eugene's reinforcements were necessary, Marlborough
fell back to meet him, and soon Eugene, leaving his troops behind
him, appeared in person in the camp. Between them they persuaded
the Margrave of Baden that the capture of the fortress of Ingolstadt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885">[885]</a></span>
was necessary, and that, as it had hitherto never been taken, it would
be much to his honour to reduce it. Thus rid of their pretentious
colleague, Eugene and Marlborough arranged their junction, which
was finally made, without disturbance from the French, on the 11th
of August, a little to the east of Hochstädt, on the north of the
Danube. The combined armies of the French and Bavarians had
also betaken themselves to the same side of the river, and were now
advancing from the west to meet the allied army, should they wish to
fight. It was believed, however, that such was not Marlborough's
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Blenheim. Aug. 13th.</span> intention.
Tallard thought he was withdrawing towards Nordlingen, and, as he said
after the battle, had intended to fall upon him and fight him on his
way thither. When it became evident that a battle was to be fought, the
French general, advancing from Hochstädt, took up a strong position in
the neighbourhood of the village of Blenheim. The hills which lie along
the north of the Danube there fall back a little, enclosing a
small plain. Across this runs a brook called the Nebel, at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886">[886]</a></span>
of a spur of rising land which runs from the foot of the receding hills
to the Danube, where its termination is crowned by the village of
Blenheim. The course of the Nebel is full of morasses difficult to
pass, but a gradual slope of firm ground leads from it to the top of
the rising ground. Along this ridge the French and Bavarians took
up their position. The Elector of Bavaria, with Marshal Marsin,
occupied the left, where, in the midst of woods, the rising ground joins
the hills; Marshal Tallard with the French occupied Blenheim and
the right. Considering Blenheim as the key of the position,
Marshal Tallard fortified it with palisades, and placed in it a considerable
portion of his infantry, thus depriving himself of their
assistance upon the battlefield, and weakening the centre of his army.
To the French was opposed Marlborough in person, while Eugene, in
command of the right wing, and with a considerably smaller number
of troops, led the attack against the Elector. The difficulties he met
with prevented Eugene from being early in position, but news were
at length brought that he was ready to begin the battle, and
Marlborough at once proceeded to the attack. The battle began on
the part of the English with an assault upon the intrenched village.
It was too strong to be taken, and the assailants were driven back
with some loss. But the vigour of the opposition his troops had met
with showed Marlborough his enemy's mistake. He determined to
direct his chief assault upon the centre of the line. The infantry
which were attacking Blenheim were ordered to seek shelter behind
some rising ground, and to keep up such a feigned attack upon the
place as should give employment to the troops stationed there.
Meanwhile, with considerable difficulty, the English army was
brought across the marshes, and established in position upon the
firm ground beyond. In the French line cavalry and infantry were
interlaced; this arrangement was copied by the assailants. The
first effort of the English to ascend the slope was defeated, but after
a fierce interchange of fire, a second attempt broke the French
cavalry, and destroying the infantry, pierced the centre of the French
line. The battle was in fact won, no help could be sent to Tallard
by the Elector, a decisive charge of cavalry drove the enemy's horse
off the field, and the army fled in two bodies, one towards the
river, the other towards Hochstädt. Both were hotly pursued,
and of those who fled towards the river thousands perished in
the stream. Blenheim still held out, but, cut off from all succour,
surrounded by the whole English army, and threatened by the
approaching artillery, the gallant garrison was compelled to capitulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887">[887]</a></span>
and 11,000 men laid down their arms. The right wing being
completely destroyed, the Elector of Bavaria had found it necessary
to withdraw his troops from the battle, although they had hitherto
held their position against the fierce attacks of Eugene. In the confusion
he managed to retire without much loss. The victory,
however, was a very complete one; 60,000 strong in the morning of
the 13th, on the 14th the French and Bavarian generals found
themselves at the head of no more than 20,000 men. All their tents
and baggage, and most of their artillery and colours, had fallen into
the hands of the allies. The list of killed and wounded on the side
of the allies was about 12,000. Marshal Tallard himself was among
the prisoners. Again, even after this defeat, the Elector of Bavaria
declined all terms, and his wife, as Regent, had to submit to such
conditions as the German Emperor chose to impose. So great was
the blow, that the French retreated with extreme rapidity; they gave
up the strong fortress of Ulm, and withdrew beyond the Rhine,
whither they were pursued by the allies, who, following separate routes,
again assembled at Philipsburg; nor even there did Villeroi withstand
them, but still falling back, allowed them to recapture Landau, during
which operation Marlborough completed his work by rapidly marching
into the valley of the Moselle and conquering Trèves and Trarbach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the war in Spain, the Cevennes, and
Italy.</div>

<p>Events of some importance had been taking place in three of the
other seats of war. In Spain, Berwick had completely worsted the
Portuguese, who had been so badly succoured by the English under the
Duke of Schomberg that he had been recalled, and Ruvigny, Earl of
Galway, a French refugee, put in his place; while, to balance this, a
fleet under Sir George Rooke, having on board the Prince of Darmstadt,
and some troops, while returning from an unsuccessful attack on
Barcelona, made an easy conquest of Gibraltar, and took possession of
it in the name of the English, to whom it has ever since belonged. In
the Cevennes, a merciful policy had brought the rebellion to an end,
and Cavalier having been offered the commission of colonel in the
French army, which he at first accepted and then declined, had been
allowed to leave the country. He entered the English army, rose to the
rank of general, and was subsequently Governor of Jersey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile affairs in Italy had been assuming a shape which rendered
it probable that the great interest of the war would be transferred
thither in the following year. Vendome had been rapidly reducing the
territory of the Duke of Savoy. One after the other his fortresses
had been captured, and no hope seemed left him but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888">[888]</a></span>
immediate succour, either from the Emperor, who was not likely to
give it, or from Marlborough himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIVE_FAILURE_OF_MARLBOROUGH_PLANS" id="SEVENTEEN_FIVE_FAILURE_OF_MARLBOROUGH_PLANS"></a>Marlborough's plans for 1705.</div>

<p>As was natural after his great successes, Marlborough expected that
the next year would be one of much importance. Seeing the impossibility
of himself assisting Savoy, he had contrived to persuade the King of
Prussia to allow 8000 of his troops to proceed to Italy, and to serve
under Eugene, who had been despatched thither. His own intention
was to follow up his late victory by an invasion of France. He had
intended that this invasion should be by the valley of the Moselle,
upon which a joint attack was to have been made, by himself up the
river, and by Louis of Baden coming from Landau. The plan had been so
far foreseen, that the ablest of the French generals, Marshal Villars,
was stationed on the Moselle, while Flanders was intrusted to Villeroi,
and Marsin continued in Alsace. The weak co-operation of the German
Prince rendered the plan abortive, nor did the death of the Emperor
Leopold, nor the succession of Joseph the young King of the Romans,
increase for any length of time the vigour of the Imperial armies. But
while Marlborough was still waiting for the Margrave's assistance,
Villeroi had suddenly assumed the offensive, had retaken some of the
fortresses of the Meuse, and invested Liège. As usual, on the slightest
sign of danger, the Dutch were clamorous for Marlborough's return.
His disappointment on the Moselle inclined him to listen to them, and
his appearance in Flanders at once re-established affairs. Though
disappointed in his main object, he still intended to fight a great
battle; but, as usual, jealousy of the allied commanders, and the
constant slowness and opposition of the Dutch general, prevented him
from bringing on an engagement. He however succeeded in breaking the
great line of French fortifications extending from Antwerp to Namur
upon the Meuse, and in advancing to the attack of Brussels across the
plain of Waterloo, where, but for the opposition he met with among his
own colleagues, a great battle might have been fought: he writes, that
he felt sure that, had he fought such a battle, it would have been a
greater victory than that of Blenheim. However, his difficulties were
more than he could overcome. The year passed away without great events,
and the French began to think that he had owed his victories to chance.
Upon the Rhine, Louis of Baden, though he had been so backward in his
support of Marlborough, showed the ability which he really possessed by
winning a great battle at the end of the year at Hagenau,
unfortunately too late to assist Marlborough in his plans. In Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889">[889]</a></span>
though Eugene won the battle of Cassano, the position of the Duke of
Savoy became continually more precarious, and the crisis had not passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peterborough's success in Spain.</div>

<p>It was in fact not with either of the great regular armies that
the allies this year won any great successes, but with the small and
mixed forces in Spain, which had been placed under the eccentric but
vigorous command of Lord Peterborough. Leaving Galway to prosecute the
war in the west, this general, who held with Sir Cloudesley Shovel a
joint command of the fleet also, drew the Prince of Darmstadt from
Gibraltar, and sailed round the east of Spain. After some successes on
the eastern coast, he was eager to march direct upon Madrid. But the
Archduke Charles, now calling himself Charles III., who was with him,
listened in preference to the suggestions of Darmstadt, who had once
been Governor of Catalonia, and trusted much to his influence in that
province. The plan of an attack upon Madrid was therefore overridden,
and the army proceeded to besiege Barcelona. Serious quarrels occurred
between the leaders, for which Peterborough's want of caution was no
doubt much to blame, and the siege was on the point of being given
up. Already the heavy cannon were withdrawn from the trenches and
carried on board ship, when suddenly Peterborough appeared in the tent
of the Prince of Darmstadt, with whom he was not on speaking terms,
and telling him that he intended to attack the enemy that night,
challenged him to follow him. Laying aside his animosity, the Prince
at once accompanied him. Peterborough's intention was to capture the
citadel of Montjuich, a fort at some little distance from the town
itself, and this he trusted to do by a sudden attack when the enemy
were off their guard. The attempt was perfectly successful. The
English troops followed the defenders pell mell into the walls of the
fortress. Scarcely was the stronghold taken than the Spaniards began
to advance from the town to retake it. Peterborough rode forward to
reconnoitre; a panic seized his troops in his absence, and they were
already relinquishing the fort, when he galloped back and rallied
them, and fortunately found that their absence had been unperceived.
The possession of this citadel was followed before long by the fall of
the city, which capitulated on the 9th of October (1705). The greater
portion of the troops in Barcelona, and much of the open country, at
once declared for King Charles. The kingdom of Valencia followed this
example, and in the capital of that province Peterborough subsequently
took up his abode. Nor did his successes end there. In the
following year, the French, under Marshal Tessé and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_890" id="Page_890">[890]</a></span>
King Philip himself, attempted to regain Barcelona. The Count of
Toulouse, a natural son of the French King, blockaded it from the sea.
Peterborough, moving from Valencia with but 3000 regular troops, did
his best to employ Tessé's army, which was 20,000 strong. But the siege
went forward uninterruptedly. Already the trenches were within 150
yards of the wall, and an immediate assault was to be expected, when
the English fleet under Sir John Leake, second in command, approached.
Though his numbers were nearly equal to those of the Count of Toulouse,
Leake, a prudent commander, wished to wait for expected reinforcements
under Byng. But Peterborough, feeling that delay would be ruinous,
determined upon a strange step to compel immediate action. He got on
board an open boat and proceeded in quest of the English fleet. After
searching for a whole day and night in vain, he at length reached
the squadron. Having produced a new commission which had been given
him, which gave him full command over Leake whenever he was himself
on board, he at once hoisted his flag and gave orders for the attack.
But meanwhile, hearing of the arrival of the English, the Count of
Toulouse had withdrawn his fleet, the town could be easily approached
from the sea, and Tessé thought it better to raise the siege. After
this brilliant exploit, Peterborough again wished to march upon Madrid
from Valencia, but King Charles, on the advice of his German council,
whom Peterborough speaks of by the contemptuous name of "the Vienna
crew," determined upon advancing straight through Aragon, and called
upon Peterborough to move his troops from Valencia to join him on the
march. Meanwhile the army of the west, under Galway and Das Minas, had,
after considerable delay, moved upon Madrid also, and had occupied
it. They found, however, the feeling there strongly in favour of King
Philip. As Aragon and Catalonia had favoured Charles, so, in the spirit
of hereditary opposition, the Castilians devoted themselves to the
interest of Philip. So strong was the opposition they met with, that
the allies had to leave the capital and fall back eastward towards the
approaching army of Charles, with whom they formed a junction. But
in the combined army there were far too many commanders for vigorous
action. Peterborough, the only man of genius among them, found himself
constantly thwarted: he put no restraint upon his tongue. Bitter
quarrels were the consequence, and he found it necessary to leave
the army and betake himself to Italy, which had been his original
destination, in order to negotiate with the Genoese for a supply of
money.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Battle of Ramillies May 23rd 1706.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same year which saw these sudden and unexpected successes
in Spain was marked by still more complete success against the
French in other parts of Europe. Marlborough was determined to
wipe out the bad impression which the inactivity of the last campaign
had caused. His own ardent wish was to march with the army
as he had in the Blenheim campaign, and to throw himself into
Italy, where the critical position of affairs still continued. Finding
it impossible to gratify this wish, he determined that he would at least
do something vigorous in Flanders which might serve as a diversion to
his friend Eugene in Italy. Bringing his army therefore across the
lines which he had broken the year before in the neighbourhood of
the sources of the little river Gheet, he came in sight of Villeroi, with
whose army the Elector of Bavaria, having lost all troops of his own,
was now serving. The place where the armies met was Ramillies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_892" id="Page_892">[892]</a></span>
Thither Villeroi had drawn his troops, with the intention of covering
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIX_BATTLE_OF_RAMILLIES" id="SEVENTEEN_SIX_BATTLE_OF_RAMILLIES"></a>Battle of Ramillies. May 23, 1706.</span>
Namur, which Marlborough's advance seemed to threaten. The French
general had received instructions to risk a battle to save that
town, and therefore afforded Marlborough the opportunity he so much
desired. The French army was very strongly posted upon a range of
heights forming a semicircle round the sources of the little Gheet
river. Their right almost touched the Mehaigne river, and was covered
by the villages of Tavière and Ramillies. Across it ran an old road
known as the road of Queen Brunehaud, closely adjoining which, in
the highest part of the position, was a barrow known as the Tomb of
Ottomond: from this point the position swept round till it terminated
at the village of Autre-Eglise, being covered from that point by the
Gheet and the marshes in which it rises. The steepness of the heights
at Autre-Eglise, and the river and marsh in its front, rendered the
position almost impregnable, but at the same time made it difficult for
the troops stationed there to act upon the offensive. Marlborough at
once saw that he had the advantage of occupying the inside of a circle,
so that to any given point the movement of his troops was shorter than
that of his enemy's could be. He saw also that the Tomb of Ottomond was
the key of the position. If this was once in his possession, the whole
line of the enemy could be enfiladed. He ordered therefore a vigorous
but false assault on Autre-Eglise. His feint succeeded; both the French
generals rode to that part of the field, believing it to be the point
of danger. Then Marlborough ordered the real attack to be made in the
neighbourhood of Tavière, Ramillies, and the road of Brunehaud. He was
enabled to draw troops from his right to strengthen his left in their
attack, and after some warm fighting, especially about the village
of Ramillies, the position was forced, the English troops formed at
right angles to their original position, and pressed onward along the
high ground occupied by the enemy. Villeroi and the Elector found it
impossible to save the day. Fresh difficulty was caused by the breaking
down of the French baggage as it was withdrawing northwards towards
Judoigne. Thus interrupted, the retreat became a rout; the enemy were
pursued far beyond Judoigne to within two leagues of Louvain. They did
not even rest there; a hurried consultation was held by torchlight
in the market-place, and the flight immediately continued towards
Brussels. The river Dyle, which Marlborough had failed to pass the
preceding year, was thus left open.</p>

<p>The consequences of this victory were unexpectedly great. Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_893" id="Page_893">[893]</a></span>
opened its gates to the advancing conquerors; King Charles was
proclaimed King in the capital of the Spanish Netherlands; even the
line of the Scheldt was deserted, and Ghent, Bruges, and Oudenarde,
fell into the hands of the allies; the great naval strongholds,
Antwerp and Ostend, which had before now sustained memorable sieges,
surrendered, the one on account of some quarrel within its walls, the
other because of its inability to withstand the advancing allies. The
list of conquests is concluded by the strongholds of Menin and Ath.
In fact the effect of the battle was to drive the French entirely out
of the Netherlands; Mons and Namur being the only towns of importance
still remaining in their hands.</p>

<p>The battle even influenced affairs in Italy. The complete
disorganization of the French army in Flanders made a change of
commanders imperatively necessary. Vendome, regarded in some ways as
the ablest French general, was summoned from Italy, where he had been
acting successfully against Eugene. He had driven the Imperial army to
<span class="sidenote">Saves Eugene in Italy.</span> retreat behind
the Adige; the Milanese had thus been cleared, and Piedmont conquered
with the exception of Turin. Into that last fortress the unfortunate
Duke had withdrawn. For the purpose of taking it, a well-appointed
army, under the Duke de la Feuillade, son-in-law of Chamillart the
war minister, but without other claims to the command, crossed the
Alps and invested the town. It was of the last importance that it
should be relieved, and Eugene determined upon a march, bold even to
rashness, for the purpose. Crossing the Po not far from its mouth,
he followed the river upwards upon its south bank. The obstacles
he encountered were many; but Vendome at this critical moment was
recalled to Flanders, and Marsin and the Duke of Orleans, who took the
command, allowed Eugene to cross river after river without opposition,
contenting themselves with following his movements upon the opposite
bank of the river. At length Eugene approached Turin, formed a junction
with the Duke of Savoy, whom the laxity of the siege had allowed to
leave the city with 10,000 men, and passing beyond Turin, turned his
back upon France, and marched against the investing army. The siege had
been carried on without skill, the lines were of immense length, and
severed into various sections by the numerous rivers which join the Po
in the neighbourhood of Turin. Orleans was eager to lead the troops
out of the trenches and risk a pitched battle, which, as the French
had a considerable advantage in numbers, might easily have resulted in
Eugene's defeat. He was overruled by Marsin, who unexpectedly
produced a commission as commander-in-chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_894" id="Page_894">[894]</a></span>
and the army awaited the assault in their trenches. Even in this
position they were badly commanded. Three generals, issuing sometimes
contradictory orders, prevented the proper concentration of troops,
and when Eugene marched against that section of the works which lay
between the Doria and the Stura, not more than a third of the French
army is said to have been ready to oppose him. The route of the French
was complete, 200 guns, and much stores and money, fell a prey to the
victors (Sept. 7). The effect of the victory was greater than the
victory itself. It was found impossible to lead the broken troops into
the Milanese; they fell back in confusion behind the Alps, thus leaving
the force on the Adige to be surrounded by enemies. Piedmont returned
to its allegiance, and in fact the whole of Italy was irretrievably
lost to France, and compelled to join the Grand Alliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The disasters of the French in 1706</div>

<p>The disasters of France had been continuous. Blenheim had secured
Germany, and in this year of 1706, Ramillies had been followed by the
conquest of the whole of the Netherlands, Turin by the conquest of the
whole of Italy, the relief of Barcelona by the occupation of Madrid
by the allied forces, although they had subsequently been compelled
<span class="sidenote">make Louis desire peace.</span> to fall back
towards Valencia. So great were the French disasters that Louis began
to think of treating, and suggested as terms on which peace might be
made a new Partition Treaty, by which he would consent to acknowledge
Queen Anne in England, to give the Dutch the barrier they demanded,
to grant great commercial advantages to the maritime powers, and to
surrender Spain and the Indies to the Archduke Charles, if only he
could preserve for his grandson Philip a kingdom in Italy consisting
of Milan, Naples, and Sicily. These terms were very attractive to the
Dutch, who thought they had already secured all they required, but were
by no means satisfactory to the Emperor, who saw that the barrier given
to the Dutch must of necessity be taken from the Spanish dominions in
the Netherlands, and therefore from his brother:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
nor to Marlborough, who, though he confessed he did not believe that
the King of France would ever make peace without securing some kingdom
for his grandson, was desirous for his own sake to continue the
war, and thought the <span class="sidenote">Marlborough rejects his
terms.</span> French demand for the Milanese after the great victories
which had been won unreasonable. With some difficulty he persuaded
Heinsius to reject the terms, and the war proceeded on its course.
It might have been better to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_895" id="Page_895">[895]</a></span> accepted Louis'
terms. Never again were the affairs of the allies in so prosperous a
condition, although the continuation of the war undoubtedly told in
their favour by the gradual exhaustion it produced in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_THE_TIDE_OF_VICTORY_TURNS" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_THE_TIDE_OF_VICTORY_TURNS"></a>The tide of victory turns.</div>

<p>It seemed indeed in the course of the next year as if the tide of
victory had wholly turned. Peterborough had returned to Spain, and
viewing the altered state of affairs, was now as eager to act on the
defensive as he had been before to urge an advance upon Madrid. His
advice was again disregarded. The introduction of Sunderland into the
ministry at home was unfavourable to him, and he was recalled, leaving
the command of Spain in the somewhat incompetent hands of Das Minas and
Galway. These generals, determining to act on the offensive, marched
out of Valencia towards Madrid, but were met near Almanza by the lately
<span class="sidenote">Almanza. April 25, 1707.</span> reinforced
army of Berwick, and suffered a complete defeat. The consequence was
the loss of Valencia and Saragossa, so that Charles was only able to
maintain himself in the province of Catalonia. The battle of Almanza
was fought on the 25th <span class="sidenote">Stolhofen. May 22.</span>
of April. On the 22nd of the following month, Marshal Villars
completely surprised the Margrave of Bareuth, who had succeeded the
late Margrave Louis of Baden in command of the Imperial troops on the
Rhine. The lines of Stolhofen, which had been so long held against the
French, were taken and destroyed. Nor was the advance of the allied
army of Italy into the south of France more successful. Eugene and the
Duke of Savoy reached Toulon and besieged it. But sickness had much
decreased the number of the allies; a considerable detachment had been
sent to complete <span class="sidenote">Toulon. Aug. 20.</span> the
conquest of Naples, and the appearance of Marshal Tessé with a large
army, and the threat of an assault upon their rear, induced them to
raise the siege and retire beyond the Alps. Nor was there anything
done in Flanders to redeem the ill-success which had met the allied
arms elsewhere. Marlborough in vain attempted to bring the French to a
pitched battle. The Dutch had lost confidence after receiving the news
of Almanza and Stolhofen, and renewed their old dilatory policy; the
rains also somewhat impeded the campaign, which was closed without any
important event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marlborough diverts Charles XII.</div>

<p>One valuable diplomatic service, however, Marlborough had performed.
Charles XII. of Sweden was in the midst of his victorious career.
Having defeated the Russians at Narva, he had succeeded in driving
Augustus, Elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896">[896]</a></span> of Saxony, from the
throne of Poland, and entering Saxony itself, was now in the
neighbourhood of Leipsic. Sweden was the old ally of France, and Louis
did not let Charles forget it. For a moment there seemed a chance that
Charles would follow in the footsteps of Gustavus Adolphus, throw
himself and his victorious army into Germany, and ruin the cause of
the allies. To deter him from this step Marlborough visited him at his
camp, and successfully directed his ambition towards his old enemies
the Russians, against whom he shortly marched to meet his ruin at the
battle of Pultowa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHT_THREATENED_INVASION_OF_SCOTLAND" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHT_THREATENED_INVASION_OF_SCOTLAND"></a>Threatened invasion of Scotland. 1708.</div>

<p>The beginning of the ensuing year was marked by a new incident in
the war. The hopes of Louis were raised by the reports of the general
discontent prevalent in Scotland; a large portion of that nation had
seen with dislike the late completion of the Union, and assurances were
brought to France of the readiness of the Jacobite party to rise in
arms. An invasion was determined on and actually set on foot. The fleet
was all ready to sail, when Prince James Edward, afterwards called
the Old Pretender, but now known by the name of the Chevalier de St.
George, who was to accompany it, was taken ill of the measles. The
expedition was postponed for some weeks, and these weeks were enough
to destroy its chance of success. Byng with a powerful fleet appeared
in the Channel, troops were brought over from the Continent and others
collected in England, and though the little squadron succeeded in
eluding the fleet and reached the Firth of Forth, there was no sign
of a general rising of the Jacobites, and it had to return from its
fruitless expedition, glad to escape with safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Campaign of 1708.</div>

<p>This threatened invasion had of course retained Marlborough in
England. It was not till somewhat late that he could join the army.
With a slight change of generals the war continued its old course.
Villars was employed to reduce Piedmont, Berwick and the Elector of
Bavaria were on the Rhine, Spain had been intrusted to the Duke of
Orleans, while in Flanders, which was this year selected as the great
battlefield, Vendome was to oppose Marlborough, having with him as
nominal commander-in-chief the Duke of Burgundy, the heir to the French
throne. Marlborough had again formed a great scheme for the campaign.
His intention was that the Elector of Hanover, who after the defeat of
Stolhofen had taken command of the Imperial troops, should remain
on the Rhine, and that Eugene, with whom he again longed
<span class="sidenote">Marlborough's plan.</span>
to act in co-operation, should form a new army and assist
him on the Moselle. The two generals met in April at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_897" id="Page_897">[897]</a></span>
the Hague, and there agreed that they would make an ostensible plan
for the invasion of Lorraine, but that they should in fact join their
two armies, and act rapidly and decisively to complete the conquest of
the Netherlands. Eugene met with infinite difficulties in forming his
new army, and Marlborough was still singlehanded when Vendome began an
offensive movement.</p>

<p>The French army had been concentrated at Mons, on the south-west
of the Netherlands. It thence advanced northward towards Brussels.
Fearing for the capital, Marlborough took up a position to cover it,
but suddenly the French marched off eastward, and threatened Louvain.
This was, however, but a feint. The real intention of the French was
to act upon the western frontier, upon the river Scheldt. The Dutch
had made themselves highly unpopular in the Netherlands since they had
had possession of that province; the disaffected inhabitants of the
great towns on the Scheldt had opened correspondence with Vendome,
and were prepared to surrender their cities to him. Having therefore
drawn Marlborough towards Louvain, he suddenly marched westward to
Alost, across the front of the English army, sending forward on his
march detachments, to which Ghent and Bruges surrendered without a
struggle. As the town of Oudenarde, somewhat higher up the river, would
complete the security of these new acquisitions, it was determined
to besiege it. Marlborough had followed close upon the heels of the
French, circling round Brussels so as to defend the capital. He had not
ceased to urge Eugene to join him with his troops, which, according to
agreement, should have been with him many weeks before. The delay was
no fault of the Prince's; he was already hurrying to join Marlborough,
when, hearing that it was his intention to fight a battle in defence of
Oudenarde, and unable to bring up his troops, he hastened forward alone
and joined the English army. Between Marlborough's army and Oudenarde
ran the river Dender, which the French determined to hold to cover
the siege. Alost, which lies a little to the north of Oudenarde, they
already possessed; at about an equal distance to the south, also on the
river Dender, was the entrenched camp of Lessines. Could they occupy
this they would be in a good position to cover the siege. Marlborough
foresaw their intention, and determined to forestall them. Although
the river between Lessines and Alost makes a considerable curve, and
Marlborough, on the convex side of it, had almost twice the distance to
traverse that the French had, he pushed on with such rapidity that
he secured Lessines and the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_898" id="Page_898">[898]</a></span>
of the river before the French columns appeared in sight. It was now
evident to the French generals that Marlborough intended to fight. They
drew in their detachments, and marched rapidly to cross the Scheldt at
Gavre, to the north of Oudenarde. Marlborough marched direct upon that
city, so that the converging lines of march would speedily meet. It was
known that there was much disputing and ill-feeling between Vendome and
the Duke of Burgundy, and that the latter Prince intended, if possible,
to avoid an engagement. With all speed Marlborough sent forward General
Cadogan to secure the passage of the river, and prepare bridges for
his army. After he had performed this duty, Cadogan rode forward to
reconnoitre, and saw the French troops crossing at Gavre, and, in
ignorance of the immediate vicinity of the English, quietly sending out
foragers. With such troops as he had he drove in the outlying posts of
the enemy, who now, apprised of the approach of Marlborough, found a
battle inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Oudenarde. July 11, 1708.</div>

<p>A little to the north of Oudenarde the river Norken joins the
Scheldt, after a course almost parallel to that river. Between the
Norken and the Scheldt an irregular semicircle of hills sweeps with
the convex side of one of its arms at Oudenarde, while the other,
surmounted by the village Oycke, overhangs the Norken; it contains in
its hollow two little brooks which fall into the Scheldt just north
of Oudenarde. On the other side of these brooks, closing the opening
of the semicircle, is an irregular mass of rising ground sloping away
northward towards the junction of the Scheldt and Norken. Vendome gave
orders to occupy this irregular mass and the valleys of the brooks, the
arm of the semicircle between Oudenarde and the course of the brooks
being occupied by Cadogan. But the Duke of Burgundy counter-ordered his
commands, and arranged his troops upon what was doubtless a stronger
position, the range of hills beyond the Norken. But though stronger
for defence, it was much less favourable for an offensive battle. These
contradictory commands cost the French their first loss. Seven battalions
of their troops having pushed forward towards Oudenarde as far as
Eyne, were fallen upon and destroyed by Cadogan, who thus crossed the
brook and ascended the irregular high land beyond it. Had Vendome's
order been carried out the position of Cadogan would have been very
precarious. He was almost unsupported, although Marlborough was coming
to his assistance with some cavalry, which he led forward for several
miles at a gallop. As it was, however, the English army came up by
degrees, and took position with their left on the semicircle of hills,
and their right supporting Cadogan beyond the brook. Thwarted in
his first schemes, Vendome now wished to remain beyond the Norken,
knowing that the enemy were wearied with a long march (it was already
four in the afternoon), and that he would have an opportunity of
withdrawing quietly in the night towards France. The Duke of Burgundy
again thwarted him. He commanded the right wing, and insisted upon
sending his troops forward across the Norken into the valleys where
the brooks ran. The country was there broken up with enclosures, and
a fierce hand-to-hand battle was fought with the English right, which
Marlborough had intrusted to Eugene. The exhibition of all the English
cavalry upon the high lands beyond the brooks held the French left
entirely in check; and while Eugene and the English were disputing
the hedges and enclosures in the valley, Marlborough, passing to the
left, observed that the extremity of the semicircle, which overhung
the Norken and was occupied by the village of Oycke, was unguarded by
the French. He caused Overkirk with the Dutch reserve to march round
the hills to occupy this point, and thus completely envelop the French
right. The effect was the total annihilation of that part of the
French army, and it was owing to an accident alone that any part of it
escaped. The two extremes of the enveloping English line came so close
together, that in the darkness they fired upon each other. The mistake
was happily soon discovered, but fearing a repetition of the accident,
the general gave orders rather to let the French escape than to run the
risk of renewing such a disaster. Some 9000 men thus broke through at
a gap in the semicircle of hills near the Castle of Bevere, and made
their escape to France. The rest of the beaten army retired toward
Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_899" id="Page_899">[899]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900">[900]</a></span></p>

<p>Both armies were speedily reinforced. Eugene's troops arrived from
the Moselle, and joined the English; Berwick, with part of the army of
the Rhine, which had been observing them, reinforced the French, but
the relative numbers of the troops were not much changed. Marlborough
and Eugene had now to settle upon a further plan of action. Before
them lay the great city of Lille, one of the earliest conquests of
Louis XIV., newly fortified with all the skill of Vauban.
<span class="sidenote">Siege of Lille. Dec. 9, 1708.</span> That the allies
should cross the frontier and enter France was speedily determined. But
while Marlborough suggested the bold plan of leaving troops to mask
Lille, while the main army marched direct to Paris, Eugene, though by no
means a timid general, urged the more regular course of besieging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901">[901]</a></span>
capturing the great fortress which lay in their way before proceeding
further. The arguments in favour of this plan were too plausible to be
disregarded. It was decided that while Eugene in person undertook the
siege, Marlborough should command the covering army. Even to bring the
siege material to the spot was a matter of no small difficulty; the
artillery alone required 16,000 horses, and the progress of the siege was
watched by a French army of 100,000. When these preliminary difficulties
were triumphantly overcome, there still remained the great fortress
itself, occupied by 15,000 men, under the able command of Boufflers.
At one time the Dutch deputies were so alarmed at the slowness of the
progress made that they urged the renunciation of the project. One of
the greatest difficulties experienced by the allied commanders was the
provisioning of the army; the land communication with Brussels was
entirely cut off, all provisions had to be brought from Ostend, whither
they had been conveyed by sea. The French determined to interrupt this
line of communication also, and to destroy one of the convoys which had
been intrusted to General Webb, with a most insufficient detachment of
troops. It has been suggested that Marlborough was here playing one
of his old tricks, that, in his jealousy of Webb, he wished for his
destruction, and had intentionally exposed him to this danger. If such
was the case he was thoroughly disappointed. When the French troops fell
upon the convoy at Wynendale, Webb made a most gallant defence and beat
them off. The very slight notice taken by Marlborough in his despatches
of this gallant action gives some colour to the rumour. The victory of
Wynendale was at all events the turning-point of the siege; from this
time rapid progress was made. On the 22nd of October Boufflers found it
necessary to capitulate for the town, while retaining the citadel, and on
the 9th of December he marched out of his last stronghold with all the
honours of war. The reconquest of Ghent and Bruges followed upon the fall
of Lille.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of Port Mahon.</div>

<p>In other directions the war had been languid. In Spain only had
anything been done. There Stanhope had taken the command in conjunction
with Staremberg, the Imperial general, and had succeeded without much
difficulty in capturing Port Mahon in Minorca, a place then regarded as
more valuable than Gibraltar, and of the highest importance as affording
a safe winter harbour for the English fleet in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>For some years the exhaustion of France had been great. The
finance ministers had been reduced to the most ruinous expedients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_902" id="Page_902">[902]</a></span>
to maintain the war, and the whole people were suffering terribly.
<span class="sidenote">Exhaustion of France. 1709.</span> To crown their
misery, the winter of 1708 was of extraordinary severity and duration.
The corn crops were frozen in the ground, the very apple trees perished
with cold. Famine threatened to destroy what the war had spared. Louis
became very anxious to treat; and as for some years it had been supposed
that the Dutch were inclined to accept a separate pacification, it
was to them that Louis addressed himself. The war party was however
for the present in the ascendant, and Heinsius, who, as Grand
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINE_LOUIS_OFFERS_TO_NEGOTIATE" id="SEVENTEEN_NINE_LOUIS_OFFERS_TO_NEGOTIATE"></a>Louis offers to treat.</span> Pensionary of Holland,
exercised a predominant influence in the Council of the Dutch, let it
be clearly understood that the Republic would treat only in conjunction
with the allies, and that the allied demands would be very high. Louis
however despatched an ambassador to see what terms could be made, but he
met with a cold reception. The Government in England, especially the Whig
members of it, were indignant at the threatened invasion of Scotland in
the previous year, and induced the Parliament to vote that the Queen's
title and the Protestant succession, the dismissal of the Pretender from
<span class="sidenote">High demands of the allies.</span> France, and the
demolition of the fortifications of Dunkirk, should be necessary elements
in any treaty: while the Dutch claimed a line of ten fortresses on the
Flemish frontier (including some still in the possession of France),
and the restoration of Strasburg and Luxemburg. Nor, in exchange for
these high demands, was any specific promise of peace given. Such was
the position of the French Government, that even these terms were taken
into consideration, and Torcy the French minister offered, though he
could get no proper passport, to go himself privately and see what could
be done to ameliorate them. He found the allies determined to demand at
least the resignation of the whole Spanish succession, together with
the restoration of Newfoundland to England. This demand put Louis in
a difficult position. It was no longer, he declared, in his power to
surrender Spain, for his grandson King Philip had a will of his own,
and, although he might have been induced to resign Spain for an Italian
kingdom, did not choose to become altogether crownless. Louis now reaped
the fruits of his former bad faith as a negotiator. The allies, believing
that this excuse was fictitious, and alleged merely to gain time, drew up
their demands in accordance with the preliminaries, and would promise in
exchange for the great concessions demanded from Louis only two months'
truce. If in that time Philip could not be induced to resign Spain,
the French King was to pledge himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_903" id="Page_903">[903]</a></span>
to join with the allies to expel him by force of arms. When
<span class="sidenote">Rejected by Louis.</span> Torcy returned with these
terrible terms, a Council was held at Versailles, and amidst tears of
indignation at the ignominious propositions, it was determined that, in
spite of the necessity of the moment, it was impossible to accept them.
Louis declared, if he had to fight, he would rather fight against his
enemies than against his own children. And now at length, humbled by
reverses, he threw himself on the patriotism of his people; a stirring
proclamation was circulated through the provinces; the King set the
example of patriotism by turning his plate and costly works of art into
money; the whole nation was touched by his humility, and the war began
again with renewed vigour. The allies had indeed pressed their demands
beyond what was either generous or politic.</p>

<p>Villars, the only great French marshal as yet undefeated, was
intrusted with the duty of checking the victorious advance of Eugene
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Malplaquet.</span> and Marlborough. His
name, and the newly roused patriotism of the country, raised the spirits
of the army, though they were in want of many of the necessaries of life.
Villars, determined to act upon the defensive, saw Tournay fall without
moving. Thence the conquerors advanced to Mons, the capital of Hainault.
It seemed necessary, if possible, to prevent the siege of this town. The
rapidity of the movements of the allies prevented Villars from attaining
that object, but the investment was scarcely formed when he crossed the
Scheldt at Valenciennes, and appeared with his army in the immediate
neighbourhood. The corner of the country between the Haine river on the
north, and the Trouille on the east, in which Mons stands, is crossed
by a barrier of high ground, rendered more difficult by large woods and
forests. To approach Mons from the south and west this ridge has to be
crossed, and the only convenient passage is by the <i>Trouée</i>, or open gap,
between the woods of Lanière towards the east, and Taisnière towards the
west. Between these woods the high land falls by several ravines into
the plain of Mons. On the crown of the ridge is the heath and village
of Malplaquet. Marlborough and Eugene, supposing that the object of
Villars would be to pass through this gap and attempt to raise the siege
of Mons, brought their army to the foot of the ascending ravines. But
Villars, under whom Boufflers, though his senior in rank, was serving as
a volunteer, feeling certain that at all events a battle would be fought,
determined to adopt a defensive position, and during the night and
day after his arrival at Malplaquet strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_904" id="Page_904">[904]</a></span>
fortified the flanking woods and the crown of the hill. Marlborough
was anxious to attack before the fortifications were complete, but
Eugene thought it necessary to await the arrival of troops coming
from the siege of Tournay. A day was thus lost, and time allowed
to render the fortifications much stronger. The battle, which began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_905" id="Page_905">[905]</a></span>
upon the 11th of September, was the most bloody and hardly contested of
the war. In their first assaults the allies were repeatedly driven back,
but the pressure upon the wood of Taisnière was so strong, especially
when it was outflanked and threatened from the extreme right of the
allies under Withers, that Villars had to weaken his centre to hold his
ground. Marlborough perceived the weakness and took advantage of it. The
entrenchments in the centre of the line were broken through and captured,
and thus the position forced. Villars had been severely wounded, and the
command had devolved upon Boufflers, who brought off the French army in
perfect order, and the fruit of the hard-earned victory was nothing but
the field of battle. The English encamped the following night upon the
French position, having lost in their disastrous victory 20,000 men. Mons
fell, but the campaign had then to be closed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWO_SUMMARY_OF_POLITICAL_PARTIES" id="SEVENTEEN_TWO_SUMMARY_OF_POLITICAL_PARTIES"></a>Summary of political parties from 1702.</div>

<p>Thus far it has been possible to follow without interruption the
general course of the war, but from this time forward
the state of politics in England exercised so decided an
influence upon it, upon the negotiations which were to
bring it to a close, and upon the position and conduct of Marlborough,
that it becomes necessary to turn back and trace the history
of parties since the Queen's accession. Speaking quite generally,
that history consists in the gradual substitution of a Whig for a Tory
Government. Rochester and the extreme high Tories were disinclined
to a great offensive war, and consequently directly opposed to
Marlborough. The Duke, not wishing to break with any great
section of English politicians, attempted, as William had done,
to govern by means of the moderate men of both parties. But
there was a second question which, even after the dismissal of
the Tories who disliked the war, prevented the completion of his
plan. The Tories were desirous that stringent measures should be
taken to support the exclusive authority of the English Church, and
in this point were strongly supported by the feelings of the Queen.
The Whigs, on whom Marlborough was induced for the purposes of
the war more and more to rely, were on the other hand inclined
towards more liberal measures. It was upon this point that the
second secession of the Tories took place, leaving Marlborough
entirely in the hands of the Whigs, and in a certain degree in opposition
to the Queen. It was the Whig determination when triumphant
to suppress the expression of High Church feeling that produced the
complete overthrow of Marlborough's ministry. At the same time,
as in the former reign, disputes between the Houses continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_906" id="Page_906">[906]</a></span>
especially when a Tory majority in the Lower House came into
collision with the constant Whig majority in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Already, before the Parliament called by the late King had been
dissolved, Rochester and the extreme high Tories had shown their
disinclination to the war, and had besides given proof of a more
exclusive party spirit than suited the views of Marlborough, to whom,
as to William, the affairs of Europe and the conduct of the war were
all in all, and who had no taste for party conflict. As was to be
expected from the character of the ministry, a strong Tory majority
was returned in October to the first Parliament of the Queen's reign.
But Rochester's views were not shared by the whole of his party;
<span class="sidenote">Tory Parliament. Oct. 1702.</span> indeed, the strength
of party feeling tended for the time to give Marlborough the support
of the Tories. In their eagerness to throw blame upon the late King,
they could not refrain from contrasting him with the Duke. Marlborough
had by this time begun his successful career by capturing the towns
of the Meuse, and the Commons proceeded to congratulate the Queen,
saying, "The wonderful progress of your Majesty's armies under the
conduct of Marlborough have singularly retrieved the ancient honour of
the English nation." The word <em>retrieved</em>, intended to imply
censure on the late King, was, in spite of the opposition of the Whigs,
carried by a large majority. For the present then, if merely out of
opposition to William, the Tories as <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THREE_DISMISSAL_OF_ROCHESTER" id="SEVENTEEN_THREE_DISMISSAL_OF_ROCHESTER"></a>Dismissal of
Rochester. 1703.</span> a whole seemed pledged to support Marlborough,
liberal grants were made, and shortly after the close of the session,
the Government, resting upon the general feeling in its favour, felt
itself strong enough to get rid of Rochester. Displeased at receiving
no more important office than that of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, he
left his government there, and remained in England. He thus afforded an
opportunity to his enemies to order him to return to his duties. On his
refusing to do so, the command was repeated in a more peremptory manner,
and in his anger he sent in his resignation, which was accepted.</p>

<p>Before this, however, the question of Church government had been
raised in the House, and the storm it excited had caused a somewhat
hasty prorogation. It had been the habit of dissenting members of
corporations so far to do violence to their conscience as to receive the
<span class="sidenote">Occasional Conformity Bill thrown out.</span>
Sacrament according to the law of the Church of England upon their
appointment to municipal offices. Having thus duly qualified themselves,
they had continued to hold office, but had gone back to their old forms
of worship. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_907" id="Page_907">[907]</a></span>
habit, known as occasional conformity, was viewed with great
jealousy by the Tories. In the first session of the Parliament a bill
was brought in to render occasional conformity illegal, and to inflict
heavy fines upon those who held office on such terms. The chief
supporter of the measure was Henry St. John, afterwards so well
known as Lord Bolingbroke. The Bill passed the House of Commons,
but its amendment by the House of Lords produced such
violent altercations, that the Queen found it necessary to put an end
to the session. It was during this session that the Commissioners
for the Union with Scotland first held their sittings. The progress
of the negotiations which produced the Union in 1706 will be given
subsequently.</p>

<p>The Parliament reassembled in November 1703, a month rendered
remarkable by the greatest storm ever known in England; it is calculated
that no less than 8000 lives were lost in it, while 800 houses and 400
windmills were reduced to ruins. The devastation caused among the forests
in the country may be estimated by the fact that Defoe, travelling
through Kent, counted 17,000 uprooted timber trees, and then desisted
from reckoning them from weariness.</p>

<p>The session was again the scene of a great contest between the Houses.
The war was still well supported, and the grants were upon a very liberal
scale, rendered necessary by the additional troops required for Portugal
and Spain, since Portugal had joined the Great Alliance, first under a
treaty with Austria, and subsequently under <span class="sidenote">The
Methuen Treaty.</span> the well-known Methuen Treaty with England. This
treaty, regarded as a triumph of diplomacy, was completed by Mr. Methuen,
the English minister at Lisbon, at the close of 1703. It was in exact
accordance with the commercial views of the time, and contained but two
articles. By the first English woollen manufactures were admitted into
Portugal, by the second it was arranged that the duty on Portuguese wines
should always be less by one-third than that on the wines of France. It
was supposed that this would not only secure the friendship of Portugal,
but would also bring much gold and silver, of which the Peninsula was
the great emporium, into England, an object regarded as of the first
importance under the mercantile system. It was when the Bill
<span class="sidenote">Occasional Conformity Bill again thrown out.</span>
against occasional conformity, which had been dropped in the preceding
session, was reintroduced that the contest began. The ministers who had
been eager the preceding year that the Bill should be carried, had, since
the resignation of Rochester and the opposition offered by his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_908" id="Page_908">[908]</a></span>
grown less eager in their Tory views. In spite of their very lukewarm
support, the Bill again passed the House of Commons by a large
majority. But again it met with great opposition from the Lords,
and was finally thrown out by a majority of eleven. As no amendments
had been proposed, there was no room for angry conferences
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOUR_DISPUTES_ON_THE_AYLESBURY_ELECTION" id="SEVENTEEN_FOUR_DISPUTES_ON_THE_AYLESBURY_ELECTION"></a>Disputes on the Aylesbury election.</span> between
the Houses. But an opportunity for quarrel was found in questions arising
from the Aylesbury election. The returning officers for that borough
had been notoriously guilty of tampering with the returns in favour of
their own friends. At the last election the vote of Matthew Ashby had
been rejected. He brought an action against the returning officer, and
a verdict was found in his favour. The case was removed into the higher
court, and three of the four judges of the Queen's Bench decided that
all decisions with regard to votes rested entirely with the House of
Commons. Upon this Ashby brought his case by a writ of error before the
House of Lords, where the decision of the Queen's Bench was set aside,
and the case finally settled in favour of Ashby. On this the Commons
engaged in the quarrel, and declared that Ashby, by appealing to the
law, was guilty of a breach of privilege. The Lords replied, declaring
that the right of voting, like any other right, might be maintained by
an action at the common law. There for the present the quarrel was left.
It seems tolerably clear that on this point the Lords were in the right,
but the newly won position of the House of Commons inspired its members
with most overweening views of their own importance. In February of this
year (1704) the Queen celebrated her birthday by surrendering her claim
to the first-fruits of ecclesiastical benefices, which were hereafter
to be employed for the benefit of the Church, and which have since been
administered under the well-known name of Queen Anne's Bounty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dismissal of Nottingham, Jersey and Seymour. May,
1704.</div>

<p>It was with the knowledge and co-operation of Marlborough&mdash;though
he had himself taken the opportunity afforded
by the prorogation to go abroad to fight the great battle
of Blenheim&mdash;that his friends in the ministry succeeded
in relieving themselves of the rest of the extreme
Tories. For the removal of Rochester in the previous year had by no
means cleared the Government of the party opposed to the active
prosecution of the war. His views were accepted and supported
by Nottingham and Jersey in the Upper House, by Hedges and
Seymour in the House of Commons. Nottingham, true to his
principles, had thrown every obstacle in his power in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_909" id="Page_909">[909]</a></span>
of a plan which had come before the Council for utilizing for
the general purposes of the war the insurrection of the Cevennes.
Thwarted in his opposition, after the close of the session, he haughtily
demanded of the Queen the immediate dismissal of all the Whigs in
the Government, threatening in case of refusal to retire. The Queen,
who loved the Tories, would probably have wished to retain him,
but she was irritated at the tone of his demand. Her irritation was
fostered by Godolphin and the Duchess of Marlborough, and she
brought herself to dismiss both Nottingham and his followers, Jersey
<span class="sidenote">Replaced by moderate Tories.</span> and Seymour.
The ministry had to be reconstructed. But Marlborough and Godolphin were
by no means disposed to put themselves into the hands of the Whigs; they
therefore called to office another section of the Tories not adverse to
the war. Harley, the Speaker of the House of Commons, was made Secretary
of State, Mansell replaced Seymour, the Earl of Kent, a moderate Whig,
succeeded Jersey, while the Secretary of War, an unimportant person, made
room for St. John.</p>

<p>These changes did not improve the position of the ministers, as the
Tory Party had still a strong majority in the House of Commons.
<span class="sidenote">Parliament. Oct. 29, 1704.</span> Marlborough's
own popularity with the House was shaken, and in the autumn session of
1704, the prevailing feeling showed itself in the form given to the vote
of thanks with which the Commons met the victory at Blenheim; this was so
expressed as to place on a level with the great general who had saved the
Empire the Tory Admiral Rooke, who had fought an indecisive battle in the
Mediterranean, for which many men thought he deserved rather blame than
praise, for though almost as strong as the enemy, he had withdrawn from
the battle without effecting anything. The Tory temper of the House was
again shown by the increased passion with which the Occasional Conformity
Bill was introduced and supported. A considerable number of the most
vehement Tories were eager to adopt their old method, and to tack it to
a Bill for the Land Tax. The Government, and that section of the Tories
who followed the newly-appointed ministers, were sufficiently strong to
defeat this movement, and the Bill met its usual fate in the House of
Lords. As in the preceding session, unable to quarrel with the House
of Lords for exercising their undoubted right, the Commons found means
of attacking them by renewing the question of the Aylesbury election.
Resting upon the decision of the House of Lords, other inhabitants of
Aylesbury had sued the returning officers. The House of Commons
had committed them to Newgate. The Queen's Bench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_910" id="Page_910">[910]</a></span>
had refused to interfere; the prisoners demanded a writ of error. The
Commons addressed the Queen against the writ, and put the prisoners
into the custody of their own serjeant-at-arms. The heat of the dispute
rendered a prorogation necessary (March 14).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIVE_GRADUAL_INTRODUCTION_OF_WHIG_MINISTERS" id="SEVENTEEN_FIVE_GRADUAL_INTRODUCTION_OF_WHIG_MINISTERS"></a>Gradual introduction of Whig ministers.</div>

<p>But the conduct of the Tory majority had tended still further
to incline the ministry towards the Whigs. Rooke was superseded as
commander-in-chief of the fleet, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, a Whig, put in
his place, and as the three years of the Parliament were now run out,
the Government influence was exercised at the elections against all
those who had voted for tacking the Occasional Conformity Bill. Even
stronger signs were visible of the intention of the Government to form
a junction with the Whigs; the ministers began an intrigue with the
Junto, promising before long to give the Great Seal to William Cowper
(a promise which was shortly after fulfilled), and admitted the Duke
of Newcastle to the ministry as Privy Seal in the place of the Tory
Duke of Buckingham. Nor was it the Government only which was changing
its views. The nation at large, thoroughly interested in the war and
disgusted at the conduct of the Tories, returned at the new elections
a large majority of Whigs. The growing influence of the Whigs was
supplemented by a family tie which connected Marlborough with that party;
as Godolphin, whose son had married one of his daughters, formed a link
with the Tories, so Sunderland, who had married another, connected him
with the Whigs. It seemed as though a bargain advantageous to both sides
might be struck between the Duke and the Whig party. The accession of
Sunderland to the ministry would on the one side strengthen Marlborough's
personal position, and render it more possible for him to carry on
his plan of government without parties; while, on the other, it would
secure to the Whigs a means of at once influencing the character of the
administration. It was determined therefore that Sunderland should enter
the ministry, and as there was then no vacant office, he was employed
at once as extraordinary ambassador to Vienna, and in the course of the
following year (1706) was raised to the office of Secretary of State. His
appointment, and the gradual inclination of the Government to the Whigs,
was followed,<span class="sidenote">Marlborough's composite ministry. 1707.</span>
at the beginning of the year 1707, by the creation of several Whig Peers,
and by a final breach with the High Tories, when the names of Buckingham,
Nottingham, and Rochester were struck from the list of the Privy Council.
Marlborough seemed now to have gained his object. The administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_911" id="Page_911">[911]</a></span>
was a thoroughly composite one. On the one side were a number of Whigs
led by Lord Sunderland, on the other a section of more moderate Tories
headed by Harley and St. John.</p>

<p>But Marlborough underrated the difficulty of managing a coalition.
In his necessary absence abroad this difficult operation was in the
hands of Godolphin, always a timid minister, without any real political
convictions, and ill qualified for a great party struggle. And
such a party struggle was now inevitable. All the ministers were
indeed at present willing to uphold the war. On other points their
views were diametrically opposed, and both sections were anxious
for a more complete admission to power of their own friends. It
was the personal influence of the Churchills alone which could
support so strange a conjunction. That influence depended upon
the favour of the Crown, which by its indirect power of influencing
Parliament was practically rather strengthened than weakened by
the Revolution. If that favour could be withdrawn the ill-assorted
ministry must inevitably fall. This truth was clear to Harley, a
man of intriguing character and the leader of the Tory section of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_WEAKNESS_OF_COMPOSITE_MINISTRY" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_WEAKNESS_OF_COMPOSITE_MINISTRY"></a>Harley, seeing its weakness,</span> Cabinet.
He perceived that it might be possible to rise upon the fall of the
Churchills, and saw how their power might be undermined. The Queen was a
devoted High Church woman; Marlborough and his friends, especially since
his growing predilection for the Whigs, were avowedly careless, if they
were not Low Church; Harley, on the other hand, had a great reputation
for religion and orthodoxy. Again and again patronage had been bestowed
on what the Queen considered Latitudinarian principles. Displeased and
hurt, she was yet too timid to stand alone, Harley supplied her with the
support she wanted. His cousin, Mrs. Abigail Hill, who was a cousin and
protégée also of the Duchess of Marlborough, ingratiated herself with the
Queen; she was appointed bedchamber woman, and married with the Queen's
influence, without the knowledge of the Duchess of Marlborough, to Mr.
Masham, a <span class="sidenote">intrigues against Marlborough.</span>
member of Prince George's household. Her quiet, even temper
formed a happy contrast to the termagant violence of the Duchess, and
Harley succeeded in making her his instrument. He roused in the Queen
a dread of the subversion of the Church, and she found courage to make
several Bishops without consulting her ministers.</p>

<p>The Whig Junto was even more angry than the ministers themselves
at this conduct. They suspected Harley's design, and determined to
drive him from the ministry. Both parties felt that the crisis had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_912" id="Page_912">[912]</a></span>
arrived. One or other of them must become predominant. They both
determined to make their power felt, and by a strange man&oelig;uvre the
extremes of both sides joined to attack the ministry. The chief points
of attack were the naval administration,&mdash;which, as it implicated
her husband, was always a tender point with the Queen,&mdash;and the
determination of Marlborough to pursue the course William had
<span class="sidenote">Failure of the composite ministry.</span>
marked out, and to carry on the war chiefly in Flanders. It was in this
session of Parliament, which began on October 23, 1707, that the joint
assault upon the Government was made. The maladministration of the navy
was the chief topic, but the Tories also introduced a motion in the House
of Lords, recommending a change of the seat of war from Flanders to
Spain, where the battle of Almanza had lately proved disastrous to the
allied armies. Marlborough pointed out in vain that this would produce
an immediate peace with the Dutch, who would feel their country open to
invasion from France; and although the Whigs, pledged as they were to
support the policy of William, could not join in such a motion, Somers
drew up a declaration, embodying both the disapprobation felt for the
management of the fleet, and as much of the Tory feeling in favour of a
change in the seat of war as was possible for his party to accept. The
declaration stated that "it is the opinion of this Committee that no
peace can be honourable or safe to her Majesty or her allies, if Spain
and the West Indies be suffered to continue in the power of the house
of Bourbon." But the man&oelig;uvre of the Whigs in joining in the assault
against Government had been successful; it was not necessary to press
the hostile resolution. Godolphin had been thoroughly frightened, and
recognized the necessity of breaking up the unnatural friendship and of
allying himself with one or other of the great parties. With the war
still continuing he could not but choose the Whigs. At once entering
into negotiations with the chief of that party, he induced Somers, as
President of the Committee charged with the duty of throwing the late
resolutions into the form of an address, to change the resolutions, by
a slight alteration in the words, from an attack upon Government into a
pledge for the continuation of the war till the French had been entirely
broken. The suggested resolutions mentioned the West Indies, reflecting
on the comparative weakness of our naval efforts, and Spain, implying a
change of the scene of war. The introduction of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHT_HARLEY_AND_HIS_COLLEAGUES_RESIGN" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHT_HARLEY_AND_HIS_COLLEAGUES_RESIGN"></a>Harley and his colleagues resign. Feb. 11,
1708.</span> words "or any other part of the Spanish monarchy,"
entirely destroyed these hostile allusions. The Whigs
had shown their power, it was no longer possible to refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_913" id="Page_913">[913]</a></span>
them their reward. It became necessary to break with Harley and
the moderate Tories. The discovery that a man of the name of Gregg,
a clerk in Harley's office, was in treasonable correspondence with
France, threw some suspicions on his master's fidelity, and Marlborough
and Godolphin agreed on Harley's dismissal. The Queen
was more difficult to move. It required a threat of resignation on
the part of the ministers to induce her to give up one who, as she
believed, thought entirely with her on Church matters, but she was
not yet free from the influence of the Churchills, and she yielded.
With him retired St. John, Harcourt, and Mansell, whose places were
taken by Boyle, a zealous Whig, as Secretary of State, John Smith as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Robert Walpole as Secretary of
War. Marlborough and Godolphin had apparently triumphed by
means of the Whigs, but their victory was won at the price of the
Queen's favour and of submission to the dictation of the Whig party,
who at once set to work to secure office for themselves; nor were
they scrupulous in the means they used, the threat that they would
turn their assault on the naval administration directly and by name
upon her husband, then on his deathbed, induced the Queen to remove
Pembroke and give the Presidency of the Council to Somers. Sunderland,
though himself a minister, intrigued with the Scotch Jacobites to
throw out the ministerial candidates at the election of Peers held in
accordance with the Union. To all this the General and Treasurer
had to submit. The administration was completed upon a Whig basis,
when Orford was forced upon the Queen as head of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Marlborough was fully alive to the insecurity of his position. It
is often attributed, though perhaps without sufficient reason, to
the desire to keep up his personal ascendancy, that he refused the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINE_INSECURITY_OF_MARLBOROUGHS_POSITION" id="SEVENTEEN_NINE_INSECURITY_OF_MARLBOROUGHS_POSITION"></a>Insecurity of Marlborough's position.</span>
terms offered by Louis; and in the following year the disastrous victory
of Malplaquet has also been considered a political battle. A truer view
of the case seems to be that, afraid of taking any decided steps, he
chose to occupy merely the position of an agent of Government, and obey
even against his own convictions the dictation of the Whig party. At the
same time, he made two desperate efforts to obtain a position independent
of home politics&mdash;he applied to the Archduke Charles for the office
of Governor of the Low Countries, which would have produced about £60,000
a year, and he also demanded from Queen Anne the position of Captain
General for life. In both cases his efforts failed. As far as England was
concerned, he probably owed his disappointment chiefly to the
conduct of his wife. Finding herself supplanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_914" id="Page_914">[914]</a></span>
by Mrs. Masham, she lost all command of her temper, and perpetually
outraged the feelings of the Queen by her violent complaints.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TEN_FALL_OF_THE_WHIGS" id="SEVENTEEN_TEN_FALL_OF_THE_WHIGS"></a>Fall of the Whigs. 1710.</div>

<p>The triumph of the Whigs, which had seemed so complete, was of
very short duration. Their fall was caused by a fault
which had been too prevalent among them since the
Revolution&mdash;whenever they had the upper hand, they
became dictatorial and overbearing. Already they had made themselves
distasteful to the Queen by the eagerness with which they had
forced themselves into power, and an unnecessary exhibition of that
power rendered them distasteful to the people. A certain Dr. Henry
Sacheverell, a strong upholder of the doctrine of non-resistance, had
<span class="sidenote">Dr. Sacheverell.</span> preached two sermons, one
at the Assizes of Derby, one before the mayor and aldermen at St. Paul's.
The mayor, who sympathized with his views, suggested that he should print
the sermons, and though the common council, when consulted, declined
to authorize this step, the preacher acted on the mayor's suggestion
and published both. They became a sort of political manifesto, which
was largely circulated through the country. The Whigs were naturally
angry at this semi-official production of doctrines subversive of all
the principles of the Revolution. They determined to take notice of the
sermons, and, foolishly disregarding the advice of Somers, they proceeded
by the extraordinary method of impeachment instead of the common process
of law. This naturally raised the foolish utterances of a clergyman to
the dignity of a party question; and when they further insisted upon a
ceremonious hearing in Westminster Hall, the trial became the fashionable
topic of the day. The excitement throughout England was very great. All
other public business came to a standstill, and when the Lords, though
they found Sacheverell guilty, took a very moderate view of his guilt,
and punished him only with three years' suspension, the verdict was
regarded as a virtual acquittal, and celebrated as a party triumph. The
exhibition of feeling called forth by this trial proved both to the
Queen and to her secret advisers how great a hold the Tory party had
upon the country. Encouraged by Harley, who loved an underhand intrigue,
and by his creature Mrs. Masham, she proceeded to act upon her new-found
knowledge, and it became evident how formidable the power of the Crown
still was. Without <span class="sidenote">Dismissal of Sunderland and

Shrewsbury Lord Chamberlain. Godolphin, instead of resigning at this
marked act of distrust, put up with the affront. Still further
emboldened by this weakness, the Queen dismissed Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_915" id="Page_915">[915]</a></span>
Sunderland, whom she had always disliked, and followed up the blow by the
dismissal of Godolphin himself. The office of Lord Treasurer was for the
time kept in abeyance, but Harley was made Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and was virtually Prime Minister. For a little while Harley attempted
negotiations with the Whigs, who still retained office, but finding
them impracticable, he determined to rest upon the Tories only, induced
the Queen to dissolve Parliament, <span class="sidenote">Harley's Tory

important members of which were Harcourt, who became Lord Chancellor,
Rochester, Lord President, and St. John, who succeeded Boyle as Secretary
of State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conference at Gertruydenberg. 1710.</div>

<p>It was with this ministry that Louis attempted to renew the
interrupted negotiations of 1709. The battle of Malplaquet and the fall
of Mons had forced him to this course, and to consent that a congress
should be held at Gertruydenberg. At first Holland refused to treat
except upon the preliminaries of the preceding year, and they still
demanded the assistance of Louis in ejecting his grandson the King of
Spain. Finally, both English and Dutch seemed to have waived this point,
but the opposition of Austria and Savoy rendered any general negotiation
impossible, and the war was resumed.</p>

<p>In Flanders it produced nothing beyond the capture of Douay, but
in Spain it was of more importance. There Stanhope succeeded with
<span class="sidenote">The war in Spain.</span> some difficulty in
inducing his colleague Staremberg and the Archduke Charles to advance
towards Madrid. They defeated the Spaniards, from whom French assistance
was withdrawn during the negotiations, at Almenara and Saragossa. They
pushed on into Castile, and again occupied Madrid. Thus, inasmuch as the
war had been fairly successful, it was in favour of the Whigs, although
the successes having been chiefly in Spain (the pursuance of the war
in which country was a part of the Tory programme), they were less
important politically than they would have been had they taken place in
Flanders. But whatever advantage the Whigs might have obtained from the
war was neutralized when, before the end of the year, events occurred in
Spain which entirely altered the complexion of affairs in that country.
Stanhope's hopes for a successful issue of his enterprise were based
on the active co-operation of the army of Portugal. Philip, with his
Spanish army, having retired northwards, there was nothing to prevent
the junction of the two armies. But, in spite of the entreaties of the
English general, the Portuguese would not move, and as the hope
of any successful issue to the negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_916" id="Page_916">[916]</a></span>
dwindled, Louis again allowed assistance to be sent to Spain, and a
considerable army, which the national spirit of the Castilians had
formed round Philip, was placed under the able command of Vendome. He
at once saw the necessity for preventing the proposed union; and his
advance to the Bridge of Almaraz rendered it henceforward impossible.
Stanhope was for wintering in Castile, and the army withdrawing from the
capital amidst the joyful shouts of the inhabitants, took up a position
in accordance with Stanhope's wishes. But the Archduke Charles, who was
as uxorious as his rival, could not bear separation from his wife, and
hurried home with upwards of 2000 cavalry, the arm in which the allied
troops were already overmatched. When it became evident that no hope was
to be expected from Portugal, the general saw that to winter in Castile
was impossible, and withdrew towards Aragon. But Vendome, smarting under
the disgrace he had suffered at Oudenarde, outdid himself. With extreme
rapidity, he pressed upon his enemy, who was retreating in two parallel
armies, one under Staremberg, the other under Stanhope. With vastly
superior forces he came upon the latter general, as he was resting his
troops at Brihuega, without the least notion of the close approach of
Vendome. Stanhope made a most gallant defence, expecting to be relieved
by Staremberg, but hours passed by, and for some unexplained reason,
Staremberg did not appear; thus having continued his defence till
ammunition failed, Stanhope was compelled to capitulate. The surrender
was already completed before Staremberg appeared. His slowness had
ruined his cause, but he did what he could to re-establish it; and at
Villa Viciosa a great battle was fought, in which both parties claimed
the victory. But no fresh victory could have given Vendome more perfect
success. Staremberg was obliged to fall back, and reached Barcelona with
7000 men only, the relics of the army which had been so triumphant in the
earlier part of the year.</p>

<p>The elections, made while the ferment of the trial of Sacheverell was
still unsubdued, produced a strong Tory majority. And it was thus,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_ELEVEN_PEACE_NEGOTIATIONS" id="SEVENTEEN_ELEVEN_PEACE_NEGOTIATIONS"></a>Harley's policy for peace</span> strong at home
and assisted by disaster abroad, that Harley and his Government were able
to set on foot their change of policy, and in spite of the failure of the
preliminaries at Gertruydenberg, to enter into negotiations for a final
peace. It seems probable that from the first Harley's policy was directed
to the restoration of the Stuarts, as well as to a return to the main
feature of their foreign policy, friendship with France. It is of
course possible that his intercourse with the Jacobites was merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_917" id="Page_917">[917]</a></span>
intended to secure his parliamentary position, but certainly his conduct
was quite in accordance with the belief that he was in earnest. The
tortuous and underhand manner in which the peace was first set on foot
points in this direction, still more so do the letters of the Abbé
<span class="sidenote">and restoration of the Stuarts.</span> Gaultier,
written in the year 1710, which declare that the new ministry had a great
consideration for the Pretender, and that some members of it were working
for him only. The restoration of the Stuarts would be rendered easier
by three things. In the first place it was scarcely possible without
the assistance of France. This seems to explain, better than the mere
wish to follow the traditional Tory policy of peace, the immediate steps
taken to put an end to the war, and the very favourable terms granted
to Louis after his disasters. Secondly, it could not be undertaken
without the support of the High Church party, which was very strong. This
explains the constant support given by the Government to that party. And
thirdly, the success of such a scheme would have been best secured by
the assistance of Marlborough, who was known to have already frequently
intrigued with the Court of St. Germains. On the other hand the Duke
would be the most formidable opponent. Steps were therefore taken to
secure his assistance, and when that was found impossible, his complete
ruin became the object to be sought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marlborough only anxious to keep his place.</div>

<p>On his return from his somewhat unfruitful campaign, Marlborough
seemed inclined, with his usual selfishness, to submit to anything for
the continuation of his personal position. We are told by St. John that
he expressed his sorrow for his former wrong step in joining the Whigs.
He even attempted to soften the angry vehemence of his wife, but her
fate was in fact determined by the personal feelings of the Queen. No
entreaties of the Duke, who even threw himself on his knees before her,
could induce the Queen to go back from her wish to deprive the Duchess
of all her offices. She was compelled to surrender her gold key, and
left her apartments at St. James's, having first gratified her spite by
carrying off the brass locks and marble chimney-pieces. The Duke himself,
though he had suffered many indignities, was permitted to continue the
conduct of the war, being assured that he should be well supported.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret peace negotiations.</div>

<p>Having thus for the time secured themselves from his opposition,
the Government proceeded to open secret negotiations
with the Court of Versailles. The agent employed was a priest
named Gaultier, who had been Tallard's chaplain, and was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_918" id="Page_918">[918]</a></span>
warm friend of the Pretender's cause. This sudden idea of peace was most
unexpected and welcome to the French. "Asking us whether we wished for
peace," says Torcy, "was like asking a sick man whether he wishes to
recover." Gaultier returned with the message that Louis could not, so
soon after the failure of the late treaty, suggest peace to the Dutch,
but he would gladly listen to the mediation of England; a shrewd answer,
which at once tended towards separating England from her allies. The
knowledge that a peace with France was likely, and that all further
help from England was hopeless, induced a French refugee of the name
of Guiscard, who had been prominent in arranging attacks upon France
and assistance to the rebels in the Cevennes, to turn traitor. His
correspondence was discovered, and in despair, upon being examined in
the Council, he determined to revenge himself upon the authors of his
misfortune, and stabbed Harley with a penknife. Harley's popularity was
raised still higher by this attack on him; he was made Earl of Oxford,
and shortly after, on the supposed success of his financial scheme for
incorporating the public creditors into a company to trade in the South
Seas, was made Lord Treasurer. The High Church temper of the time was
further illustrated by the passage of a Bill for erecting fifty new
churches in London, and of the Occasional Conformity Act, now proposed in
the House of Lords which had always previously obstructed it.</p>

<p>The negotiations opened by Gaultier were also continued, Prior
was sent to Paris, and a more specific scheme was set on foot than
had been produced by the verbal negotiations of the spring,
although, unmoved or ignorant of the action of the Government,
Marlborough was attempting to continue his great career. He had
<span class="sidenote">Marlborough's plans for the campaign of 1712.</span>
planned a combined movement with Eugene against Villars, who had
constructed lines near Arras and Cambrai so strong that he boastfully
said he had brought Marlborough to the "non plus ultra." The vigour of
the campaign was checked by the withdrawal of Eugene, who was required
to superintend and guard the Electoral Diet at Frankfort, which had been
summoned to elect the successor to the Emperor Joseph, who had died on
the 17th of April. It was Marlborough's intention to reduce Bouchain and
Le Quesnoy, to winter in France, and in the spring press forward towards
Paris. His schemes were only partially successful, owing principally
to the slowness of the Imperialists. By some skilful man&oelig;uvres he
succeeded in passing the formidable lines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_919" id="Page_919">[919]</a></span>
besieged and took Bouchain, but was unable to carry his great project
further.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposed terms of peace.</div>

<p>On his arrival in Paris, Prior found that Louis had authority to treat
for Spain as well as for himself, and proceeded to explain the conditions
demanded. England no longer insisted upon the surrender of the Spanish
crown, but would be satisfied with the pledge that the two crowns should
never be united; Gibraltar, Minorca, and Newfoundland must be secured
to England; Dunkirk demolished, and four towns granted for trade in
South America. Great commercial advantages must be granted both to the
English and Dutch, and fortified towns given as barriers for the Dutch
in the Low Countries, and for Austria on the Rhine. All this was as yet
kept profoundly secret. The negotiation was subsequently transferred
to London, and there, in September, eight preliminary articles were
drawn up. Louis was to acknowledge Anne and the Protestant succession;
a new treaty of commerce was to be made; Dunkirk was to be demolished,
some fair equivalent being given; Gibraltar, Minorca, and Newfoundland,
with the exception of some fishing rights, were to be secured to the
English. In addition to this, the Assiento, or grant of the slave trade
with America, was withdrawn by Spain from France and given to England. A
second set of preliminaries was prepared for Holland, omitting the chief
advantages gained by England, but introducing stipulations to secure a
barrier and to prevent the junction of the crowns of France and Spain.
The Dutch, though much dissatisfied with the desertion of the English,
were compelled to give in their adhesion, and Utrecht was appointed as
the place where the conference was to be held. Austria was even more
outspoken in its anger, and the Imperial minister in London, who was rash
enough to express the indignation of his Court in a published appeal to
the people, was compelled to leave the country.</p>

<p>Affairs had reached this point when Marlborough returned from his
campaign. Entering into communication with his old friends
<span class="sidenote">Attack on Marlborough on his return.</span>
the Whigs, he found that they had formed a coalition with a section of
the Tories under Nottingham, who was much displeased at having been
excluded from all the late ministerial arrangements. Marlborough's object
was no doubt to join the strongest side. The present position of the Whig
party seemed to him so promising that he gave it his adhesion. Nor
<span class="sidenote">Parliament, Dec. 7.</span> was he mistaken as things
then stood. On the opening of Parliament, Nottingham moved, as an amendment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_920" id="Page_920">[920]</a></span>
the Address, the old Tory resolution that no peace could be safe or
honourable to Great Britain or Europe if Spain or the West Indies were
allotted to any branch of the Bourbons, and after a hot discussion
succeeded in beating the Government by a majority of eight. In the House
of Commons, on the other hand, the Government commanded a large majority.
Harley and St. John had now to consider what steps to take against this
hostile coalition in the Lords. They determined, in the first place,
to strike a heavy blow at Marlborough, and the report of a Commission
which had been issued to examine into the public accounts afforded them
an opportunity of doing so. Basing its assertion on the deposition of
Sir Solomon Medina, who had contracted to supply the army in Flanders
with bread, the Commission reported that the Duke had received on those
contracts large sums of money, amounting on the whole to £63,000, while
his secretary, Cardonnel, had also received large douceurs. It also
declared that Marlborough had received 2½ per cent. on all subsidies
to foreign troops, amounting on the whole to £177,000. Acting on this
report, the ministry stripped Marlborough of all his offices. Marlborough
was so notoriously avaricious, and his character was so mean, that
these charges seemed to the public probable; but, in fact, his reply
was tolerably complete. The bread money had habitually been received by
every commander-in-chief in Flanders, and had been expended chiefly in
obtaining information as to the enemies' plans. The percentage on the
subsidies was a free gift from the princes to whom they were paid, and
Marlborough had not accepted them without the royal warrant. In the state
of feeling at the time these excuses were not much regarded. Having got
rid of their most powerful enemy, the ministry made use of the royal
prerogative to neutralize the influence of the Lords. Twelve new Peers
were created, which gave them a permanent majority.</p>

<p>Having by these strong measures secured their position in Parliament,
Harley and St. John proceeded with their negotiations. There
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWELVE_ORMOND_GIVEN_COMMAND" id="SEVENTEEN_TWELVE_ORMOND_GIVEN_COMMAND"></a>Command of the army given to Ormond. 1712.</span> was
some difficulty with regard to the prosecution of the war while the
Congress was sitting. The command had been given to the Duke of Ormond,
a man of strong Jacobite principles; he was privately instructed not to
undertake any offensive operations against the French, and he consequently
informed Villars that he need not be afraid of attacks from the English,
although the pressure which Eugene put upon him was so strong that he
could not refuse to join in the siege of Quesnoy. His strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_921" id="Page_921">[921]</a></span>
lukewarm prosecution of the war, which seemed rather like friendship
than hostility, did not pass unnoticed in England. But all complaints
were answered by the assertion that the Queen would shortly lay
before Parliament the conditions of a peace. In fact, she was only
waiting till Philip of Spain should have made up his mind whether to
accept an equivalent for the Spanish crown, and retain his rights on
<span class="sidenote">The Queen announces the treaty. June 6.</span>
France, or remain where he was and renounce those claims. When the answer
arrived, preferring the latter alternative, the Queen went down to the
House and explained the proposed treaty. Though violently opposed,
addresses of confidence were carried.</p>

<p>An armistice was at once declared, and the English troops ordered
to separate from Eugene. It was not without a considerable feeling
of disgrace that 12,000 English troops withdrew from their old comrades
in arms; the English stipendiaries refused to obey the command,
and remained with the Prince. A visit of St. John, now Lord Bolingbroke,
to Paris, put the finishing stroke to the negotiation, and peace
was virtually declared. The campaign, completed by Eugene alone,
was unsuccessful. His defeat at Denain, and further successes won
over the allies by Villars, inclined the new Emperor to look more
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTEEN_PEACE_OF_UTRECHT" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTEEN_PEACE_OF_UTRECHT"></a>Peace of Utrecht. 1713.</span> favourably upon
the peace. The treaties were ultimately signed at Utrecht on the 31st
of March 1713. The Emperor's peace, by which the Electors of Cologne
and Bavaria were reinstated, was postponed for a year, and was finally
completed at Rastadt in the following March. It is certain that the
terms gained were infinitely less advantageous than the lengthened and
victorious war might have justified, or than those which could have been
obtained at the negotiations of Gertruydenberg. The desertion of the
Catalans, who had risen in insurrection chiefly at the instigation of
the English, was undoubtedly an act of selfishness; and Government would
even have sacrificed the advantages of the Methuen Treaty, and granted
commercial terms far more in favour of France, had not the moneyed
interest proved too strong for it. At the same time, though the Peace of
Utrecht was not a glorious one, there is much to be said in its favour;
the changed position of Europe, by the accession of Charles to the
Imperial crown, had in truth put the questions at issue upon a totally
new footing; it would have been quite as disadvantageous to the general
European balance that Spain and Austria should have been joined in the
hands of the Imperial house as that Spain and France should have been in
the hands of the Bourbon Princes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_922" id="Page_922">[922]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The succession.</div>

<p>After the close of the great war, the question of succession,
rendered more pressing by the failing health of the Queen, came
prominently forward. In the midst of the negotiations the Pretender had
written a letter to Queen Anne, and Bolingbroke had been throughout in
correspondence with him. <span class="sidenote">Harley's conduct.</span>
It is difficult to determine how far Harley was really mixed up in the
plot of changing the succession. That he had frequently expressed himself
as friendly to the Pretender is certain; but his indolence in business,
his constant difficulty in making up his mind, and his love of intrigue,
prevented him from taking any strong or definite line in the scheme for
the Stuart restoration. <span class="sidenote">Bolingbroke's views.</span>
With Bolingbroke the case was different. He was unaffected by any Church
views, for he did not believe in Christianity; he knew that the part he
had already played had rendered him obnoxious to the Elector of Hanover,
he had therefore little hope of office after the Queen's death. On the
other hand, he was certain of being a trusted minister of the new Stuart
king. To help him in the Cabinet he had Brumley, Ormond, and probably
Harcourt. But for the success of his plan extreme care was necessary;
for the general feeling of the country, though Tory and High Church, was
nevertheless Protestant and Hanoverian. An over-hasty declaration of
Jacobitism would probably destroy his ministry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTEEN_NEW_TORY_PARLIAMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTEEN_NEW_TORY_PARLIAMENT"></a>New Tory Parliament. 1714.</div>

<p>A new Parliament assembled in February. It was again Tory in
its views; and it shows the real object of Bolingbroke's
tactics, that the Pretender during the elections wrote
to his friends to use their best efforts in favour of the
Government. The new appointments also, which were made on the
occurrence of vacancies by deaths, show the same Jacobite tendencies.
Wyndam became Chancellor of the Exchequer, Athol and Mar two of
the chief officials in Scotland. Nor was the Jacobite scheme confined
to the appointment of ministers, more immediate practical
measures for securing the change of Government were taken. The
<span class="sidenote">Ormond reorganizes the army.</span> Cinque Ports
were placed in the hands of Ormond, and the entrance of a foreign force
into England thus rendered easy; the army was remodelled, and the greater
part of those troops which William had organized disbanded; while a plan
was set on foot for obliging officers in the army known to be friendly to
Marlborough to sell their commissions, which only failed because Harley,
either through indolence, or because he really shrunk from
supporting the Jacobites, neglected to have the funds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_923" id="Page_923">[923]</a></span>
ready for the purchase. The Whigs, on their side, also organized
themselves for the coming crisis. General Stanhope was regarded as their
leader. They seem to have been ready for all emergencies, intending even
to employ force, if necessary, to secure the throne for the Hanoverian
Elector. In spite of the caution of Bolingbroke, the scope of his plans
began to be discovered, and it became necessary still further to blind
the nation. Pretending to treat as libels all suggestions that he was
aiming at the restoration of the Stuarts, he introduced a resolution that
the Protestant succession was in no danger, but his credit was too far
shaken to allow of a complete victory. The motion was indeed passed, but
the small majority proved how large a section of the Tories were attached
to the Hanoverian house, and were willing on that point to make common
cause with the Whigs. That party were encouraged to take a further step.
Thinking it of the last importance that the Electoral Prince should be
in England to take possession of the inheritance of his house on Anne's
death, they induced the Hanoverian minister to demand his writ of summons
to the House of Lords as an English Peer in virtue of his title of Duke
of Cambridge. The Government was thrown into great perplexity; to refuse
it seemed to confess their Jacobite tendencies, to grant it was certain
to enrage the Queen, who, like other childless sovereigns, was morbidly
touchy about the succession, and it would moreover deal a heavy blow at
their own plans. The writ was given, but accompanied by a letter from the
Queen to the Electress Sophia, couched in such angry language that it
is said to have caused the death of that princess, now far advanced in
years.</p>

<p>But a schism within its own body was gradually undermining the
ministry. Harley, undecided upon all points, and strongly bound by old
ties to the Low Church and dissenting interest, could not throw himself
heartily into the vigorous policy of Bolingbroke; he was, moreover,
jealous of the ever-increasing importance of his energetic colleague. The
Schism Act, a measure conceived in the most exclusive High Church spirit,
brought their rivalry to a crisis. It enacted that no person should keep
a public or private school, or act as tutor, unless a member of the
Church of England, and licensed by his Bishop, thus in fact throwing the
whole education of the country into the hands of the Church. Harley, bred
a dissenter, and always relying much on the support of the Nonconformist
bodies, could not give it his hearty support. With his usual indecision,
he played fast and loose with the Bill. But he had lost the ear of the
Queen, Bolingbroke and Mrs. Masham had supplanted him, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_924" id="Page_924">[924]</a></span>
favourite so played upon the Queen's High Church propensities, that,
after a hot altercation in the Council before the eyes of the Queen, she
was induced to dismiss the Lord Treasurer.</p>

<p>In the dismissal of his dilatory rival Bolingbroke saw the removal
of the last obstacle to the completion of his schemes, and he was
preparing to form a ministry wholly in the Jacobite interest, when
the Queen's sudden illness upset all his plans. Had the matter
come to the decision of arms, Marlborough, who had just returned
from abroad, might, after the treatment he had received at the
hand of the Tories, have been trusted to do his best for the
Whigs. But, fortunately, the question was destined to meet with a
peaceful solution. The Duke of Shrewsbury, in his time the
leader of the Whigs of the Revolution, and subsequently guilty of
treacherous correspondence with the Stuarts, continued his vacillating
policy. The part he had taken in 1708, in persuading the Queen
to rid herself of the Whigs, had given him the confidence of the Tory
party. But he had never ceased to regret the one false step of his
life, and was firmly attached to the Hanoverian succession. His
position in the ministry enabled him for the time to become really
master of the situation, and to thwart all the schemes of Bolingbroke.
With this end in view he arranged a plan with the Dukes of Argyle
and Somerset. As the Council was sitting to consider what steps to
<span class="sidenote">The Queen's death.</span> take in consequence
of the Queen's illness, the two Dukes suddenly made their appearance,
claimed their right as Privy Councillors, were by Shrewsbury's advice
admitted, and at once proposed that the Queen, who had for the moment
recovered consciousness, should be requested, in view of the coming
crisis, to make the Duke of Shrewsbury Lord Treasurer. A deputation, of
which the Duke was himself a member, went to her bedside, and persuaded
her to give him the White Staff. Vigorous measures were at once taken.
Troops were collected, the Elector summoned over, and everything was
ready to withstand armed invasion, and to hasten the peaceful acceptance
of the legal heir, when the Queen died on the 1st of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWO_LENGTHENED_NEGOTIATIONS_FOR_THE_UNION" id="SEVENTEEN_TWO_LENGTHENED_NEGOTIATIONS_FOR_THE_UNION"></a>The Union.</div>

<p>For several sessions the Parliament had been acting under the new
title of the Parliament of Great Britain, the Union with Scotland having
been completed in 1707. Quite at the beginning of the reign, in 1702,
leave having been given both by the Scotch and English Parliaments,
Commissioners had met to make arrangements for the Union,
which had always been a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_925" id="Page_925">[925]</a></span>
project of William's. Neither party were, however, much in earnest, and
the members of the Commission were lax in their attendance. There was no
difficulty in agreeing upon the main points, but upon trade and finance
the claims advanced by the Scotch, who seemed to wish on the one hand for
equality of duties, and on the other for exemption from liabilities, were
regarded as untenable, and in February 1703 the Commissioners ceased to
meet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scotch Parliament. 1703.</div>

<p>On the 6th of May in that year the Scotch Parliament met, under the
Presidency of the Duke of Queensberry as Lord Commissioner. Its temper
was anything but conciliatory. The ill feeling excited by the Darien
Scheme had by no means subsided. The late futile efforts of the joint
Commission had still further roused the angry feelings of the people,
and there was an idea afloat, by no means without foundation, that the
High Church Tories, who were just coming into power, would seize the
opportunity for an assault upon the National Church. All these causes
influenced the temper of the Parliament, and instead of taking measures
tending towards the Union, it seemed bent upon doing all that was
possible to render the kingdoms quite separate. The Queen's letter, in
which she recommended toleration, was contemptuously neglected, and a
strong declaration passed, confirming the Presbyterian Church, "as the
only Church of Christ in the Kingdom." Politically, the conduct of the
Parliament was even less conciliatory. Resolutions were passed declaring
that, after the death of the Queen, no King of England should make peace
or war without consent of the Scotch Parliament; though the nation was
in the midst of a great war with France, restrictions on the trade in
French wine were removed; Fletcher of Saltoun introduced what were known
as the Limitations, by which the authority of the Crown was seriously
compromised; its power of appointing to the great offices of Government
was transferred to the Parliament; and finally, a Bill of Security with
regard to the succession was introduced, authorizing Parliament to name
a successor from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line,
but asserting that whoever that successor might be he was not to be the
same as the successor to the Crown of England, unless proper security
was given for the freedom of religion and trade. The nomination of the
Princess Sophia, hazarded by the Earl of Marchmont, was received with
derision and anger. All these Bills, except the last, received the royal
assent. But the refusal to pass the Bill of Security was so unpopular,
that it was found necessary to adjourn the House without securing any
subsidy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_926" id="Page_926">[926]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following year the Parliament again met. It was hoped that
a new Commissioner would manage it more successfully,
<span class="sidenote">Scotch Parliament. July 1704.</span> and the
Marquis of Tweeddale was appointed to succeed Queensberry. The policy of
conciliation was carried to an extreme, and Godolphin, always a timid
minister, allowed Tweeddale to give the royal assent even to the Act of
Security.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English Parliament. Oct. 1704.</div>

<p>The hostile feeling exhibited by the Scotch Parliament only went
still further to prove what the Darien Scheme had made
evident, that the Union was imperatively necessary.
Whigs and Tories therefore combined, when the English
Parliament met, in attacking Godolphin for his weakness; and in
December, Somers brought forward, and succeeded in passing through
both Houses, a law which seemed to threaten war between the
countries. After Christmas 1705, all Scotchmen were to be regarded
as aliens, the importation into England of the chief Scotch products&mdash;cattle,
coal, and linen&mdash;was prohibited; and as a still stronger threat,
it was ordered that the Border towns should be fortified and put
into a state of security, and the militia in the northern counties
called out. This severe threat was not without its effect. But the
anger of the Scotch at the time only grew more vehement. In April
of the following year, 1705, Thomas Green, a captain of a ship belonging
to the new East India Company, had been seized by the agents
of the Darien Company, charged with piracy in the East, and with
the murder of a Darien captain. It was afterwards proved that the
captain was alive; nevertheless, in spite of orders from the English
Council, the Scotch ministers were overawed by the popular feeling,
and the unfortunate man, with some others of his crew, was hanged.
But England was now determined that the Union should be effected.
Tweeddale was removed from his commissionership, and Argyle,
assisted by Queensberry, put in his place. This gave Tweeddale an
<span class="sidenote">Scotch Parliament. June 1705.</span> opportunity
of forming a third party in the Parliament, which attempted to hold
the balance between those who were for the Union and those who opposed
it, and was known by the name of the Squadrone Volante. On the whole,
however, this party acted with the Government. The Queen had instructed
the Parliament to consider the question of the settlement of the
succession, and the appointment of Commissioners to treat. With regard to
the first point it proved obstinate, it insisted on first discussing the
condition of trade, and could not be induced to name any successor.
With some slight alterations, it passed again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_927" id="Page_927">[927]</a></span>
the Limitations suggested by Fletcher of Saltoun, and added further, that
a Scotch ambassador should be present at all treaties involving the two
nations. But upon the second point, by the aid of the Squadrone Volante,
the Government was successful. The threatened Alien Bill indeed began
to have its effect; and it was ordered that the Commissioners should
not begin to act till that Bill was repealed. As it seemed to have done
its work, this suggestion was attended to, and in November the English
Parliament repealed the Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commissioners meet. 1706.</div>

<p>Thus then, the chief obstacles being removed, in April 1706, the
Commissioners, thirty-one on each side, met. The English Commissioners
at once suggested as the prime object of negotiation, that there should
be one Kingdom, one Parliament, and one Successor. The Scotch seemed
first to desire a Federative Union, but yielded, on condition that their
religion should be free, and that their trade should enjoy a general
equality of advantage. It was the details, especially of taxation
and trade, which gave the greatest trouble. The Scotch insisted on
discussing them in detail. It was finally agreed that they should be
exempt from terminable taxes, and receive an equivalent for any present
loss they might sustain, by taking their share in the public debt of
England, which was larger than their own. The revenue of England was
about £5,700,000, that of Scotland about £160,000. The debts of England
amounted to £17,700,000, those of Scotland, taken roughly, to £160,000;
that is, England owed three and a half, Scotland only one year's revenue.
The equivalent fixed was £398,000, which was employed to pay off the
whole Scotch debt, to dissolve the Darien Company and indemnify its
shareholders, and for other Scotch purposes. The other questions were
easily settled. The title of the United Kingdom was to be Great Britain,
the national flags were to be incorporated in one. The Scotch taxes
amounted to little more than a fortieth of the English. Had this been
observed as a basis of representation, they would have had but thirteen
members of Parliament. But this being held too few, they were granted
forty-five members, which was about a twelfth of the whole House of
Commons. The same proportion was taken for the basis of the arrangement
of the Upper House, and thus of the whole Scottish Peerage sixteen were
to be elected to sit in the united House of Lords.</p>

<p>When the Treaty had been settled by the Commissioners, it was
brought before the Scotch Parliament, where it met with violent
opposition. In one way or another it was objectionable to many classes.
The Jacobites saw in it the final destruction of all their hopes of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_928" id="Page_928">[928]</a></span>
change of dynasty. The extreme Presbyterians did not believe in a
Union which would leave their Church untrammelled. The views
of the Revolution had gone further in Scotland than in England,
and a considerable body of active spirits had adopted republican
views; to them the establishment of a monarchy backed by the
strength of England was distasteful, as rendering any fulfilment of
their hopes impossible. And the Edinburgh tradesmen recognized
to the full the loss they would sustain by the removal of Parliament
to London. The discussion on the various points went on throughout
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_THE_UNION_COMPLETED" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_THE_UNION_COMPLETED"></a>Scotch Parliament. Oct. 1706.</span> the whole of
the year. The final effort of the Opposition was to be a great protest,
to be produced at the debate upon the share Scotland was to have in the
national legislature. This protest was to be presented by Hamilton, as
premier Peer, and to be followed by a secession of the minority. But
Hamilton's heart failed him at the appointed moment, the protest was
not presented, and on the 16th of January 1707 the measure was finally
carried by 110 votes to 69.</p>

<p>Having been successfully passed through the Scotch House, the Bill
had now to be ratified by the English Parliament. So many changes had
been made that it was possible there might be much difficulty in securing
the easy passage of the Bill. But as the Whigs and the Government were
determined that at all hazards it should become law, they accepted
without question all the Scotch amendments. When the articles of the
Treaty had thus been carried through the House, there yet remained
the Act of Ratification to complete it. It was still possible for the
opponents of the Bill to reopen discussion upon each article in detail.
The skill of Sir Simon Harcourt, the Attorney-General, thwarted this
disastrous intention, by so wording the Bill that the articles themselves
were not called in question, but their ratification alone demanded. He
induced all parties, who were on the whole agreed that in some shape or
other the Bill had better pass, to accept it. With little opposition
therefore it was carried through both Houses, and became law, and the
succeeding Parliament took the name of the Parliament of Great Britain.
Party feeling was at the time very high, and accusations of bribery were
lavishly flung abroad, but a closer examination appears to prove that
these charges were unfounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTEEN_FALL_OF_THE_WHIGS" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTEEN_FALL_OF_THE_WHIGS"></a>Probability of a restoration of the Stuarts.</div>

<p><span class="first drop">E</span><span class="smcap">ngland</span> had been slow to accept the principle of succession by
parliamentary instead of hereditary right; since 1688 the struggle had
been continuous, it had reached a crisis in the closing years of Queen
Anne. The triumph of the Whigs, secured to them by the constant successes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_930" id="Page_930">[930]</a></span>
of the War of Succession, had rendered them over-confident, and an act
of foolish severity had been followed by their complete overthrow. The
natural inclinations of the Queen, and the weakness of her character,
which rendered her constantly liable to be subjugated by the influence
of those around her; the talents and intriguing ambition of St. John,
and the energy and compactness of the Jacobite body resting upon the
general Conservative feeling of the nation, had rendered the return of
the Stuarts to the throne a very probable event. A few weeks only were
wanting for the completion of the plot, and James Edward would probably
have been received as heir to the throne, and the work of the Revolution
have been undone. The unexpected illness of the Queen, the rapidity and
energy with which the Hanoverian Lords of the Council had carried out
what was virtually a <i>coup d'état</i>, had destroyed these hopes. When the
Lord Treasurer's staff was placed in the hands of the Duke of Shrewsbury,
all hope of carrying out this counter-revolution with the aid of the
executive was at an end. Although he had more than once faltered in
his allegiance to the Whig party, it was now well understood that he
was endowed with something not far short of a dictatorship, for the
express purpose of carrying out the enactments of the Act of Succession.
Everything was done as arranged by that Act. There was no difficulty with
regard to the regency; sealed packets containing the names of those who
were to act as the Council of Regency, chosen by the Protestant successor,
<span class="sidenote">Council of Regency.</span> were in his hands. On
their being opened, the names of eighteen Lords, almost exclusively of
the Whig party, were found, who, together with the seven great officers
named in the Statute, were to act, under the title of Lords Justices,
as an interim Government until the arrival of the new King. It is to be
observed that the name of the Duke of Marlborough was not among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peaceful accession of the King.</div>

<p>Parliament was to continue for six months before dissolution, and
everything for the present passed off quietly; the Civil List was voted
as in the preceding reign; and on the 18th of September the King and his
eldest son arrived in England. He was not a man to excite enthusiasm. An
unostentatious man, used to a Court where his will was law, but where
the manners were singularly primitive and plain, he was little suited to
the peculiar position of an English Parliamentary sovereign, from whom,
along with the possession of but little real power, much dignity and some
magnificence were required. Unable therefore to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_931" id="Page_931">[931]</a></span>
comprehend the working of that constitution over which he had
come to preside, and without ability sufficient to carry on a policy of
his own, he naturally threw himself into the arms of that party to
which he owed his Crown. The great offices, several of which had
been for the last month united in the hands of Shrewsbury, were
<span class="sidenote">New Whig ministry.</span> therefore distributed
among the Whigs. Townshend was put at the head of the Government, and
with him were Halifax, General Stanhope, Lord Cowper, Nottingham, and
Lord Townshend's brother-in-law, Sir Robert Walpole; while Sunderland
was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Duke of Marlborough (though
the King had already shown his well-founded mistrust of him) reassumed
the offices of Commander-in-chief and Master of the Ordnance. His power,
however, was gone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triumph of the Whigs.</div>

<p>The establishment of the Hanoverian house had thus very much the
appearance of a triumph of a faction. There were no attempts at
conciliation, such as had been made after the Revolution, no efforts
to give a general and national character to the Government. The King
came forward as the head of the triumphant Whig party. This attitude
naturally at the time excited much ill-feeling, yet on the whole it was
wise. George was not the man to carry out a scheme of comprehensive
government which had already twice failed in the abler hands of William
and of Marlborough. The questions at issue were too vital to admit of
compromise, and the Whig party were wise in their view of the crisis.
A crushing victory was necessary to teach both their conscientious and
factious opponents a lesson,&mdash;the one must yield to the force of
circumstances, the other must discover that their only road to office
lay in concession to principles which they were too weak to shake.
Conscientious upholders of the Stuarts must be taught that their choice
lay between submission and the resignation of their claim to be regarded
as Englishmen; those who used the Stuarts as a road to power must be led
to see that they must henceforward limit their opposition to points of
minor importance, that the main principles of government were fixed for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Riots in the country.</div>

<p>But the conduct of the King and of the Whigs, though wise, was
such as to drive the Jacobites to extremities, and to
render an appeal to arms sooner or later almost certain.
The irritation of the high Tories at once showed itself. In January,
as the six months had elapsed, the House was dissolved, and on the
meeting of the new House in March, it was found, as was at that
time usually the case, that the party in power commanded a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_932" id="Page_932">[932]</a></span>
majority. This however had not been secured without serious riots. In
Manchester and the midland counties the riots assumed the form of an
attack upon the dissenters, and were so serious as to necessitate the
passing of a Riot Act. By this Act, which is still in force, it is
enacted, that "If any twelve persons are unlawfully assembled to the
disturbance of the peace, and any justice of the peace, sheriff, &amp;c.,
shall think proper to command them by proclamation to disperse, if they
contemn his orders, and continue together for one hour afterwards, such
contempt shall be felony, without benefit of clergy."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTEEN_IMPEACHMENT_OF_THE_LATE_MINISTERS" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTEEN_IMPEACHMENT_OF_THE_LATE_MINISTERS"></a>Impeachment of the late ministers. March.</div>

<p>Having secured their majority, it became evident that the Whigs
intended to use their regained ascendancy to the uttermost. The Address,
both in the House of Lords and in the Commons, was obviously pointed
against the framers of the Peace of Utrecht, and before three weeks were
over a secret committee was appointed to consider that peace. Bolingbroke
had already fled and taken service with the Pretender. Ormond, who till
this time had remained in England, putting himself ostentatiously forward
as the leader of the Jacobite opposition, followed his example. Oxford
alone awaited his trial. The two fugitives were proceeded against by
bill of attainder. The impeachment of Oxford was after a while dropped;
in fact, it was difficult to substantiate the charge of treason against
him. It was not till long afterwards that any real proof existed of
treasonable correspondence with the Pretender; and it was scarcely
possible to twist the faults and weaknesses of the Peace, the desertion
of the Catalans, even the surrender, unasked, of Tournay, one of our
conquests, into crimes under the law of treason; nor was the doctrine
of the responsibility of ministers as yet sufficiently established to
allow the majority at once to answer Oxford's solemn declaration, that
he had acted distinctly upon the royal authority. It is true that the
plea had been overruled in the case of Danby; but even in the last reign
the Whigs had themselves sought shelter, after the battle of Almanza,
behind the royal authority, and it was not till more than twenty years of
regular party government had intervened that the doctrine was thoroughly
understood and adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jacobite conspiracy.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the aggressive policy of the Whigs was hurrying on
an outbreak of the conspiracy which the timely death
of the late Queen had checked. It was widespread.
Ormond, until his flight, had been busily engaged in organizing it
in England, while Bolingbroke had taken it in hand in France:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_933" id="Page_933">[933]</a></span>
for then, as always, it seems to have been accepted, that any insurrection
would be useless without material help from France. In
many parts of the country, particularly in the west, the feeling
against the Hanoverian succession was strong, and measures had
been taken to secure Bristol and Exeter, and other great western
towns. In Scotland the difficulty was rather to restrain than to urge
forward the Jacobite feeling. Many causes combined to create a widespread
<span class="sidenote">Disaffection in Scotland.</span> discontent in
that country. In the north the feeling of loyalty to an hereditary chief
was part of the national character, inwoven with the whole system of
clanship. The national pride was flattered by the thought of a Stuart,
a Scotchman, sitting upon the throne of England. Moreover, there was
one chief of predominant power whose interests had been always Whig,
and jealousy of the ascendancy of the clan Campbell, and of its head,
the Duke of Argyle, or Mac Callum More, on this, as on several other
occasions, tended to throw all rival clans into the arms of any party of
which he was the declared enemy. In the Lowlands other influences were at
work. The Presbyterians were not likely to forget the unsparing cruelty
of the later Stuarts, and now that they had the upper hand, the tolerated
Episcopalians met with no great courtesy at their hands; a constant
source of quarrel was thus opened, and the Episcopalians and Catholics
might be well expected to seek refuge from the intolerance of their
victorious rivals, and a restoration even of their former superiority, in
the establishment of the exiled dynasty. But more than that, everything
English was unpopular. Two great imaginary injuries were rankling in the
national mind. The nation had never forgiven King William's treatment
of the Darien Scheme, and were still smarting under the supposed yoke
which the Union had laid upon them. Whoever was King of England was their
natural enemy, so that, except in those places where settled industry
had already felt the advantage of the union with England, there was
great readiness to join in any enterprise which would be injurious to
her. There were therefore ready to join the cause of the Stuarts in the
north all the great clans except the Campbells, and in the south the
Episcopalians, and those nationalists who regarded as righteous any act
of antagonism to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of the Jacobite hopes of French
assistance.</div>

<p>But the movement, both in Scotland and in England, was held to
depend on the conduct of France, and it was probable
that, under Bolingbroke's able management, assistance
would come from that country. The King was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_934" id="Page_934">[934]</a></span>
far different from the Louis of other days. Enslaved by the religious
influence of Madame de Maintenon, and surrounded by bitter party disputes
with regard to the legitimization of his bastards, his energy was gone,
while war and taxes and persecution had much depressed the power of
France. Still, irritated by the Whig assault upon his friends in England,
the champion as he believed himself of legitimacy, and angry at the
opposition raised by the English ministry to his new fortifications at
Mardyke, he had used his influence with Spain to procure sums of money
for the conspirators, had himself supplied arms, and had allowed a small
squadron to be equipped at Havre at the expense of France. The flight of
Ormond, the first blow to the conspiracy, was followed, on the 1st of
September, by the death of Louis. The Government passed into the hands of
the Regent Orleans, whose policy was of a purely personal character, his
chief aim being the exclusion of the Spanish house from the succession
should the young King die. To secure his plans at home external peace was
necessary. Personal friendship, both for Stair the English ambassador,
and for Stanhope the English secretary, rendered him still more
disinclined to break with England. Hope from France was gone. Bolingbroke
saw at once the course affairs were taking, and despatched a messenger
to tell the leaders of the conspiracy that, as Scotland could not rise
without England, and England could not rise without France, and France
had no intention of moving, all thoughts of insurrection had better be
dropped.</p>

<p>His prudent message came too late. The Pretender, weary of
waiting, had taken matters into his own hands, and a leader had
<span class="sidenote">Mar organizes the insurrection in Scotland.</span>
already been despatched to raise the northern counties of Scotland.
This leader was the Earl of Mar. At Anne's death Mar was Secretary for
Scotland, a man of no very great ability, but who, for his skill in
trimming his sails to the wind, had earned the nickname of "Bobbing
John." He once more tried to play his old game, but found himself
mistrusted, and had to give place to the Duke of Montrose. He now
hurried to London, sought favour at Court, took a wife from among
the leaders of the Whig party, and having thus thrown people off the
scent, hurried back to Scotland to organize the insurrection. His chief
influence was in Aberdeenshire, north of the Grampian hills; and there,
early in September, he contrived a meeting of the chief clans of the
neighbourhood. He was joined by Tullibardine, the heir of the Duke of
Athol, who brought with him the Murrays, and by the great clan of the
Gordons, with Lord Panmure, from the north of Perthshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_935" id="Page_935">[935]</a></span>
towards which county he at once began to march. The Pretender
could not refuse to support Mar's open movement on his behalf.
In October he hurried across France, evading an attempt of Orleans
to arrest him, and an attempt on the part of the English ambassador
to assassinate him. He reached St. Malo in safety. Thence an expedition
under Ormond was to have been thrown upon the English coast.
Twice Ormond was thwarted by the weather; his third attempt was
<span class="sidenote">Vigorous measures of the English Government.</span>
too late, the English fleet lay before the port. Had he succeeded in
landing, no better fortune would have awaited him; the English Government
had already heard of the gathering of the Highland clans, the Habeas
Corpus Act was suspended, the more active Jacobites arrested; such troops
as were then in England, some 8000 in number, were hurried to the west
(for the Scotch outbreak was looked upon only as a feint); some 6000
troops, due from Holland as a guarantee for the Protestant succession,
were demanded; fresh regiments were rapidly formed; and the command in
Scotland was given to Argyle, the natural opponent of the Jacobite clans.
The vigorous measures of the Government had in fact already broken the
neck of the conspiracy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mar's success in the Highlands.</div>

<p>But there was still real danger in the North, for Mar had an
overwhelming superiority of forces, and before the end of October he had
the complete command of Scotland as far as the Forth. Argyle, desirous
of confining the rebellion as much as possible to the north and east,
attempted to hold the line of that river. Mar, to whom immediate success
was everything, and who overrated the strength of his party in England,
was desirous of crossing the Border as soon as possible, in order to
rally the disaffected round him. He had now about 12,000 men with him,
but these were poorly armed, and even this poor equipment was due to no
care of Mar's, but to a gallant dash by the Master of Sinclair upon an
English ship lying in the Forth. With these troops he would probably have
been unable to have passed Argyle at Stirling, even if he had not been
prevented from moving by the expected arrival of the Pretender. It was
therefore determined that a detachment under <span class="sidenote">One
detachment marches into England,</span> Brigadier Mackintosh should be
thrown across the Firth, and marched direct for England, while the main
body should threaten and retain Argyle upon the upper river. The movement
was well executed, and 1500 men passed over at a broad part of the
estuary near North Berwick. They thence, after an ineffectual
march upon Edinburgh, proceeded unopposed directly
south to Kelso, as Argyle was kept from following them by Mar's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_936" id="Page_936">[936]</a></span>
movements. They were here joined by some horse under Lord Kenmure,
and by a few English horsemen under Mr. Forster, with whom was Lord
Derwentwater. One cause at least of the insurrection is clearly pointed
out by a proclamation which was here issued, in which the chief stress
was laid upon the foreign domination imposed upon the nation by the late
Union. Some difficulty was found in persuading the Highlanders to cross
the Border, and the march was directed therefore in a more westerly
direction, following along the back of the Cheviots, and crossing into
England near Longtown in the direction of Carlisle. Even in spite of
this concession to their feelings, several hundreds of the Highlanders
deserted, and the rest had to be tempted forward by a promise of pay.
From Carlisle they marched up the valley of the Eden to Penrith, crossed
the hills to Lancaster, where they were well received by the many
Catholic families in the neighbourhood, and, foolishly leaving this
strong place behind them, pushed on for Preston on the Ribble. Since
entering England, the command-in-chief had devolved on Mr. Forster, and
the insurgents knew that they were being followed by General Carpenter
with between 2,000 and 3,000 men. Forster&mdash;a very inefficient
commander&mdash;directed his attention only to the pursuing army, and
discipline was much relaxed. On the 11th of November, General Wills was
marching upon Preston northward from Wigan. To reach Preston he had to
cross the Ribble by a bridge, and then pass upward along a lane which is
described by Cromwell, in 1648, as "very deep and ill," and which it had
cost him four hours to clear. Wills met no opposition till he reached the
town, where a gallant defence was <span class="sidenote">and is defeated
at Preston. Nov. 13.</span> made behind barricades. The neglect of all
proper precautions is somewhat explained by the fact that Mr. Forster
was unable to attend a council of war held that morning, having been
compelled to take to his bed on account of "some damage" which he had
received "at a convivial entertainment." On the 13th, however, Carpenter
joined Wills, the town was completely surrounded, and the insurgents saw
the necessity of a surrender. Much dispute has arisen about the terms of
that surrender. It seems probable that Wills used ambiguous language,
understood by the insurgents to contain a promise of clemency&mdash;by
himself, as insisting upon an unconditional surrender. Colonel Oxburgh,
Mr. Forster's negotiator, declared upon the scaffold that the words
used were: "You cannot better entitle yourselves to that clemency than
by surrendering yourselves prisoners at discretion." 1500 rebels gave
themselves up, among them eight noblemen. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_937" id="Page_937">[937]</a></span>
however a considerable number of English Catholics had joined the Scotch
since entering Lancashire, a good many of the rebels must have made good
their escape.</p>

<p>On the same 13th of November on which Generals Carpenter and Wills had
joined their forces the insurgent operations in the North had also come
to a disastrous conclusion. Mar had moved slowly south and west along the
great valley of Strathmore, which leads direct from Perth to Stirling.
He was approaching Dunblane when he heard that Argyle with 4000 regular
troops was already occupying it. On a neighbouring eminence called
Sheriffmuir, a spur of the Ochil hills, the armies encountered. The
royalist left wing was unable to withstand the rush of the clansmen, and
immediately withdrew <span class="sidenote">Mar is defeated at Sheriffmuir.</span>
towards Stirling. The insurgents had held that their own left wing
was secured by some marshy ground, but Argyle perceived that a light
night-frost had rendered the morass passable. He fell with his cavalry
upon the left flank of the Highlanders, and drove them from the field.
The battle was thus equally balanced, the peculiar curve of the ground
rendered any general view of the action impossible, and Mar, on his
return from the pursuit of the right wing, finding his own left
destroyed, determined to retreat, leaving to Argyle the full advantages
of the victory.</p>

<p>The battle of Preston had proved the impossibility of relying upon
any formidable insurrection in England. As the royalist troops were
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTEEN_THE_PRETENDER_ARRIVES" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTEEN_THE_PRETENDER_ARRIVES"></a>The Pretender appears, but flies before Argyle.</span>
collected and armies strengthened, the chances of success
became less every day. Mar remained quiet at Perth, and Argyle and the
English saw that delay was wholly in their favour. But in January a
new colour was given to the affair by the arrival of the Pretender at
Peterhead. He at once assumed the style of royalty, issuing proclamations
and appointing a day for his coronation. The English ministry could
not believe that so bold a step would have been taken without promised
support from France. Immediate action became therefore necessary, and
through villages burnt by the Pretender's order, and deep snow which
Mar believed impassable, Argyle moved northwards, gradually threatening
Perth. From the first James had shown but little military spirit, and
now, although the clansmen offered to fight for him to the last, on the
30th of January (1716) the army was withdrawn from Perth across the
frozen Tay, and marched along the coast to Montrose, whence James and
Mar withdrew secretly to France, deserting their followers, who, still
retiring northward, were wholly broken up as an army when Argyle
reached Aberdeen on the 8th of February. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_938" id="Page_938">[938]</a></span>
every man that ever bore the name of Stuart, with fair abilities,
James was selfish and self-seeking to the last degree. Faithless to his
friends, a slave to his sensual passions, he was respectable only in a
certain gift of personal bravery, in a sort of grandeur of obstinacy,
and in the tenacity with which he clung to his religious creed and
his hereditary rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Punishment of the rebels.</div>

<p>As is always the case on the defeat of a domestic treason, strong
pressure was brought to bear upon the ministers to induce
them to act leniently towards the prisoners. The
seven noble prisoners&mdash;Derwentwater, Kenmure, Nithsdale, Wintoun,
Widdrington, Carnwath and Nairn&mdash;were impeached by the House
of Commons, all but Lord Wintoun pleaded guilty, and sentence was
pronounced. Then every means was brought to bear upon the King&mdash;private
petitions from the wives of the accused noblemen, supported
by the influence of all the ladies of the Court; petitions of ladies to
Parliament, and lastly, an address from the majority of the Lords,
urging him to reprieve if possible. These efforts were so far successful
that all were reprieved with the exception of Derwentwater,
Kenmure, and Nithsdale. The two first were executed, the escape
of the last was contrived by the skill of his wife, who conveyed a
woman's dress to her husband, in which he passed safely out of his
prison, personating a lady friend who had accompanied the Countess
on her visit, and who remained in his place. Three other important
prisoners, Mackintosh, Forster, and Lord Wintoun also made good
their escape, which seems to indicate either a strong sympathy on
the part of the gaolers, or perhaps a wish on the part of the Government
to avoid the necessity of more executions. Of the lesser
prisoners, many of the common men were executed or transported;
officers who had been in the King's service were summarily shot;
but a very large proportion of those captured in Scotland being
brought for judgment to Carlisle, in contravention, it was asserted,
of the terms of the Union, were punished lightly or released, for
fear of exciting fresh national quarrels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Septennial Act. April 26, 1716.</div>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the excitement on the part
of the Jacobites, or the fear on the part of the Hanoverians,
was by any means allayed, and as by the existing
Statute of 6 William and Mary, Parliament would
be dissolved at the close of the year, and a new election held in the
spring of 1717, there seemed great probability of a renewal of the
contest, or at least of very serious riots during the election time.
With this in view, the ministers proposed that the existing Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_939" id="Page_939">[939]</a></span>
should be continued for a term of seven instead of three years.
This, which was meant for a temporary measure, has never been
repealed, and is still the law under which Parliaments are held.
It has been often objected to this action of Parliament, that it was
acting arbitrarily in thus increasing its own duration. "It was a
direct usurpation," it has been said, "of the rights of the people,
analogous to the act of the Long Parliament in declaring itself indestructible."
It has been regarded rather as a party measure than
as a forward step in liberal government. We must seek its vindication
in the peculiar conditions of the time. It was useless to look to
the constituencies for the support of the popular liberty. The return
of members in the smaller boroughs was in the hands of corrupt or
corruptible freemen; in the counties, of great landowners; in the
larger towns, of small place-holders under Government. A general
election in fact only gave fresh occasion for the exercise of the
influence of the Crown and of the House of Lords&mdash;freedom and
independence in the presence of these two permanent powers could
be secured only by the greater permanence of the third element of the
Legislature, the House of Commons. It was thus that, though no doubt
in some degree a party measure for securing a more lengthened tenure
of office to the Whigs, the Septennial Act received, upon good constitutional
grounds, the support and approbation of the best statesmen
of the time. It was upon these grounds that Lord Somers declared
that the measure would be the greatest possible support to the liberty
of the country, and Speaker Onslow, with a clear view of the tendency
of the Act, believed that it would emancipate the House of Commons
from its former dependence on the Crown and the House of Lords.
It was however probably the more far-sighted only who saw the
advantages to which the Septennial Act would lead. It was meant
for a temporary Act, and the reasons for its necessity, as set forth in
the preamble, are the expenses of frequent elections, the constant
renewal of party animosities, and the probability, "at this juncture,
when a restless and Popish faction are designing and endeavouring
to renew" the rebellion within and invasion without, of an election
being likely to prove destructive to the peace and security of the
Government. At the same time it is plain that men's eyes were being
opened to the threatened loss of independence of the Lower House,
for a private Bill was introduced, and subsequently carried through
in a modified form by Government, to forbid the holders of pensions
withdrawable at will from sitting in the House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First signs of the breaking up of the Cabinet.</div>

<p>No sooner was the great question which had held the Whig party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_940" id="Page_940">[940]</a></span>
together settled by the suppression of the insurrection, than certain
elements of disunion which already existed in the Cabinet began to make
themselves felt, and a train of circumstances began, which ended in
the disruption of the ministry. The tumult of pardon and execution had
scarcely subsided, when the King, to the great dislike of his ministers,
giving way to those natural inclinations which were for many years to
be the chief weakness of our Hanoverian Princes, insisted upon the
repeal of the clause of the Act of Settlement which restrained the King
from leaving England, and hurried to his hereditary dominions. Stanhope
accompanied <span class="sidenote">George and Stanhope go to Hanover.</span>
him as representative of the English ministry, Townshend being left
at home. This separation of the ministry of itself afforded room for
intrigue, and the state of affairs both at home and abroad supplied a
more than usually appropriate occasion for it, for the hereditary family
quarrel had already broken out between George and his eldest son. It
was impossible, however, to ignore his claims to the regency during his
father's absence, nor would Townshend permit them to be overlooked. The
King was with difficulty persuaded to put the Government in his hands,
with the inferior title of Guardian of the Realm and Lieutenant, and
under considerable restrictions. The minister in England was thus at
once put, in some sort, in opposition to the King, and in a position
which gave great opening for the intrigues of his enemies who surrounded
the King; for a clique, consisting of the King's Hanoverian courtiers,
Bernsdorf, Bothmar, George's private Secretary Robethon, and Madame
de Schulenberg, Duchess of Kendal, the royal mistress, were full of
animosity to the minister. Like the Scotch followers of James I., they
regarded England as a sort of promised land, and took umbrage at the
attempts of the English ministry to check their rapacity. The mistrust
thus engendered was rapidly increased by subsequent events, chiefly
connected with the affairs of the Continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations with France.</div>

<p>As the King entered Hanover with Stanhope, the minister was
met by the Abbé Dubois, an agent of the Regent Orleans,
and negotiations began for the establishment of friendly
relations with France, which mark an entire change in the politics
of Europe. To complete the security of the new succession, it was
regarded as necessary that the Pretender should be removed beyond
the Alps, and that all hope of assistance to his cause from France
should cease. Open hostilities to gain this end seemed out of the
question. Austria was much irritated by the Barrier Treaty, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_941" id="Page_941">[941]</a></span>
which the Dutch were secured a line of fortresses in the Austrian
Netherlands, garrisoned by the Dutch, but paid by Austria. The
Emperor, too, was naturally jealous of the increasing power of the
Princes of the Empire, three of whom had acquired kingdoms; the
Elector of Saxony was King of Poland, the Elector of Brandenburg
King of Prussia, the Elector of Hanover King of England. The
temper of Austria thus forbade all hope of re-establishing the Grand
Alliance. The withdrawal of support from the Pretender had to be
sought by peaceful means; and the Regent, intent on his personal
aims, was willing to surrender the cause of the Stuarts, and to destroy
the works at Mardyke as the price of peace with England. On
these terms negotiations for a treaty, in which Holland was to share,
were begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger of Hanover from Charles XII.</div>

<p>The German objects of the King rendered its speedy conclusion an
object of the first importance. After his defeat at Pultowa, Charles XII.
had withdrawn to Bender, where he had vainly attempted to rouse the Turks
to assist him against the Russians. In his absence, Russia, Poland, and
Denmark, the countries which in turn he had conquered, combined against
his deserted country; and the King of Prussia, for his own ends no doubt,
but with some appearance of keeping the balance between the parties,
succeeded in neutralizing Pomerania, and in obtaining the sequestration
into his own hands of the strong town of Stettin. This arrangement by
no means pleased Charles, who hastened home from Bender, hoping by an
alliance with England to keep his enemies at bay. The accession of the
house of Hanover destroyed this hope. The Elector of Hanover had obtained
from Denmark Bremen and Verden, part of the spoils of Charles, and was
pledged by his own interests to oppose him. He insisted upon an English
fleet being sent to the Baltic, though the question was obviously one of
German interest only. Not content with opposing Sweden, George eagerly
desired that the fleet should be used against Russia, for that country
had invaded Mecklenburg, and intended apparently to appropriate it.
Again it was evident that the question was chiefly of German interest.
Townshend placed the English view of the affair before the King&mdash;it
did not matter much who possessed Mecklenburg, but to attack Russia, the
chief opponent of Sweden, was to leave Charles XII. free for dangerous
designs in favour of the Stuarts, in which he was now almost openly
engaged. Fortunately diplomacy induced the Czar to withdraw, and the
question was thus solved.</p>

<p>But while eager for war with Sweden and Russia, George was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_942" id="Page_942">[942]</a></span>
naturally anxious for the conclusion of the peace with France, and
thought himself purposely thwarted by his minister, when the
peculiarities of the Dutch constitution threw delays in the way of its
completion, and Townshend refused to break faith and conclude the treaty
without the accession of the Dutch. The King's dislike for
<span class="sidenote">Dismissal of Townshend.</span> Townshend,
excited by his opposition to his German plans, was sedulously fomented
both by his Hanoverian courtiers and by the Earl of Sunderland, who,
thoroughly discontented with his subordinate position in the ministry
as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, had joined the King at Hanover, and
had entered busily into the intrigues going on there. A letter from
Townshend, in which, in order to allow the longer absence of the King,
he recommended that additional powers should be given to the Prince in
England, brought matters to a crisis. Townshend was dismissed from his
office, and offered in exchange the viceroyalty of Ireland. For the sake
of the party, and upon some sort of apology from the King, Townshend
accepted his new office, and the quarrel was temporarily healed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTEEN_THE_TRIPPLE_ALLIANCE" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTEEN_THE_TRIPPLE_ALLIANCE"></a>The Triple Alliance. Jan. 1717.</div>

<p>During this brief reconciliation, the negotiations which had been
carried on at the Hague and Hanover were completed, and a Triple Alliance
was signed in January 1717, by which the clauses in the Treaty of Utrecht
having reference to the Protestant succession in England, to the French
succession, and to the renunciation of the Spanish King to his claims on
the French throne, were guaranteed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in the ministry. April.</div>

<p>But Walpole and the other friends of Townshend took an early
opportunity of showing their discontent at the treatment of their leader,
and it became necessary to dismiss them. The direction of the Government
thus fell into the hands of Stanhope, as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Sunderland and Addison became Secretaries of State, and James Craggs
Secretary at War. The occasion of the final schism was a demand for a
supply to oppose the intrigues of the King of Sweden. The lukewarmness of
Walpole's support was so marked that his friends and those of Townshend
voted against Government, and the supplies were carried by a majority
of four only. The fraction of the Whigs who thus left office at once
passed into vigorous opposition; yet the crisis was one which should have
overpowered party feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger to England from Charles XII. and
Alberoni.</div>

<p>The state of Europe was such as to threaten difficulty, even danger,
to England. Two statesmen of unusual ability were at
work in Europe; to both of them the fall of the new
Government in England was an object, and when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_943" id="Page_943">[943]</a></span>
intrigues for a moment brought them together, there was a brief
interval of real danger. These were Charles XII. of Sweden, and
Alberoni, the Prime Minister of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles XII.</div>

<p>Charles had found himself thwarted in his schemes for re-establishing
his power by the opposition of the English King. The same opposition had
checked the Czar in his ambitious schemes on Mecklenburg. In union with
his minister, Görtz, an adventurer who had passed into his service from
that of the Prince of Gotthorp, Charles determined on a new combination
of the North to suit the altered politics of Europe. He allied himself
with his old enemy the Czar, and despatched Görtz to Holland, to see what
he could do in France and England. In each of those countries he found it
possible to enter into communication with a large discontented minority.
In France, the Duke of Maine, irritated at the loss of the position
which the late King's will would have given him, had put himself at the
head of the older and graver statesmen, who clung to the old policy of
enmity with England. In England, the Jacobites were still looking out for
foreign support. To both countries Görtz sent an agent,&mdash;while Spaar
was, if possible, to produce a change of government in France, Gyllenborg
was instructed in England to promise the Tories the assistance of
12,000 men under the personal command of the King of Sweden. In seeking
assistance for his plans, Görtz had come across another intrigue tending
in the same direction. He found in Alberoni a man whose views were for
the time identical with his own, and Spanish money found its way largely
both to the Pretender and to the Swedish agents. Fortunately the English
Government obtained information of what was going on. Justly holding that
his ambassadorial rights were forfeited by his treason, they apprehended
Gyllenborg and seized his papers, and persuaded Holland to act in the
same manner with regard to Görtz. The papers thus seized afforded full
justification for what they had done. But though thwarted in this scheme,
both Charles and the Czar continued to act in unison with Spain against
the interests of England. It was to meet this plot that the supply was
demanded which caused the final schism in the English ministry. The death
of Charles in September 1718, at the siege of Friedrichshalle, whither
he had gone in his haste to secure Norway, the possession of which was
a part of his bargain with Russia, prevented the Northern branch of the
intrigue from bearing fruits, and a revolution in Sweden, which changed
it into little more than an oligarchical republic, removed it for more
than sixty years from the scene of history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_944" id="Page_944">[944]</a></span></p>

<p>Alberoni's plots were of more importance. He was one of those
statesmen who owe their rise to the democratic character of the Roman
Church. The son of a market gardener, of a singularly undignified
exterior, he had found means to make himself indispensable
<span class="sidenote">Alberoni.</span> to the Duke of Vendome during
the war of the Spanish succession, and had subsequently established
his position in Spain by bringing about the marriage of Philip with
Elizabeth of Parma. His object was entirely patriotic; he desired to
replace Spain in the list of great European nations. For this purpose he
set to work with remarkable success to revive the industry and wealth
of the country. But his views reached further than this; he aimed at
the destruction of the Treaty of Utrecht. By that treaty Austria had
gained almost all that Spain had lost. It was therefore against Austria
that his designs were chiefly directed. Knowing of the irritation which
existed between Austria and England with regard to the Barrier Treaty,
and believing that France would be unwilling to do anything to the
disadvantage of a Bourbon kingdom of its own creation, he supposed that
Austria would be without allies. To secure friendship with England, he
even granted her great commercial advantages. The defensive alliance
between England and Austria, in 1716, was the first blow to his plan.
The subsequent conclusion, in 1717, of the Triple Alliance opened
his eyes to the probable policy of France. It was then that he threw
himself into the intrigues of the Jacobites and the party of the Duke
of Maine, and put himself into communication with Charles of Sweden.
Alberoni's chief object was to destroy the Austrian power in Italy.
Conscious that Spain had gained in strength by the loss of her widespread
foreign dependencies, he had no intention of conquering that country.
But he wished to restrict the Austrian power there, firstly, by the
establishment of younger branches of the Spanish house in Sicily (at
the instant belonging by the Treaty of Utrecht to Victor Amadeus of
Savoy), and in the duchies of Parma and Tuscany, where the reigning
houses were drawing towards extinction, and to which Elizabeth Farnese
had claims; and, secondly, by the increase of the territory of Savoy,
which he designed to compensate for the loss of Sicily by the cession
of a portion of Lombardy. The possession of Sicily was therefore of the
first importance to him. But Austria had already been negotiating with
the powers of the Triple Alliance for the exchange of that island for
Sardinia. Alberoni himself desired to wait till Spain had acquired more
power at home, but the apprehension by the Austrians of a newly
appointed Spanish inquisitor roused the anger of Philip V., and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_945" id="Page_945">[945]</a></span>
against his will, Alberoni was hurried into war. To prevent the
exchange of Sicily he at once took possession of Sardinia, and would
probably have proceeded to attack Sicily, when the Powers of the
Triple Alliance intervened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of the Triple Alliance.</div>

<p>Their offer of mediation involved the renunciation on the part of
Austria of all claims on the Spanish monarchy, which had never hitherto
been dropped,&mdash;on the part of Spain of all claims on the Italian
provinces. The exchange of Sicily for Sardinia was to be carried out, and
Parma and Tuscany to be given to Don Carlos. Enraged at this offer, the
work of men, as he said, "who cut and pared countries as they would Dutch
cheeses," Alberoni at once set to work all the apparatus his intrigue
had prepared. The anger of Savoy was aroused at the loss of Sicily;
the Turks, already at war with Austria, were subsidized and urged to
further exertions; Ragotski, Prince of Transylvania, was brought forward
to demand his hereditary dominions, to hamper Austria on the east; the
Spanish envoy in France busily stirred up faction there; Charles XII.
and the Czar were urged to immediate action; and an expedition against
England, headed by Ormond or the Pretender himself, was set on foot. The
whole of Europe seemed involved. The mediating Powers found themselves
likely to be drawn into war. Stanhope was removed from his position as
First Lord of the Treasury, and made Secretary of State for the Southern
Department, which included foreign affairs, and on June 4, 1718, Admiral
Byng set sail from England for the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTTEEN_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTTEEN_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE"></a>Formation of the Quadruple Alliance. August
1718.</div>

<p>The crisis was so threatening that the Austrian Emperor, who had
refused to accede to the mediation of the Powers, yielded. England
procured for him the Treaty of Passowitz, which secured him from the
Turks, bought off at the expense of the Venetians, from whom they had
conquered the Morea; and a Quadruple Alliance between England, France,
Austria, and Holland was formed on the basis of the old project of
mediation, with this difference, that Parma and Tuscany were to be held
by Don Carlos only as fiefs of the Empire. Without open declaration of
war, France and England had virtually joined the Austrian alliance.
Alberoni, however, persisted in his schemes, but fortune had turned
against him. The Spanish fleet, not knowing whether it was peace or war,
was fallen upon and destroyed by Byng off Cape Passaro; Savoy, yielding
to the pressure of the Quadruple Alliance, accepted Sardinia in exchange
for Sicily; the death of Charles XII. broke up the Northern Alliance;
the conspiracy in France was discovered when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_946" id="Page_946">[946]</a></span>
approaching maturity, the Spanish ambassador and the Duke and Duchess of
Maine apprehended; of the Pretender's expedition, scattered in the Bay of
Biscay, two frigates only reached Loch Alsh in Scotland. A few hundreds
of the Highlanders gathered to their standard, but the appearance of
English troops put them to flight; the chiefs escaped to Spain, the
Highlanders were allowed to fly <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETEEN_FALL_OF_ALBERONI" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETEEN_FALL_OF_ALBERONI"></a>Fall of Alberoni.
Dec. 1719.</span> unmolested to their hills, the Spanish troops were
taken prisoners of war. War having now been regularly declared, the
French crossed the Pyrenees, and again and again defeated the Spanish
troops; and at length Philip was compelled to dismiss his great minister,
and on the 19th of January 1720 acceded to the terms of the Quadruple
Alliance.</p>

<p>The affairs in the North of Europe were settled in a similar
high-handed fashion. There too a nation, struggling to regain its old
preponderance, had to be crushed. The death of Charles XII., and the
revolution which followed it, put an end to any chance of Sweden's
regaining its position in Europe. The new Government fell back upon the
old policy of the country; Bremen and Verden were allowed to remain in
the hands of George, and an alliance with England and France was entered
into. As a necessary consequence the late allies of Sweden again became
its enemies. But the friendship of France and England drove them to
peace. Orders were even issued to the English Admiral of the Baltic to
fall upon the fleet of the Czar without declaration of war, unless with
Denmark, his ally, he consented to a cessation of hostilities. Too weak
to resist, Denmark accepted a sum of money and retired from the contest;
and the Czar, <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_EUROPEAN_PEACE" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_EUROPEAN_PEACE"></a>European peace. 1720.</span>
now standing alone, withdrew, though still in arms, to await a better
opportunity for action. The foreign policy of Stanhope had thus been
successful, and though unjust and domineering, secured for Europe a peace
of twelve years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTEEN_STANHOPES_HOME_POLICY" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTEEN_STANHOPES_HOME_POLICY"></a>Stanhope's home policy.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the minister had carried out with consistency the politics
of his party at home. In acting thus he was met with considerable
difficulties. On the one hand he had to manage and repress the meddlesome
and rapacious German coterie which surrounded the King, on the other he
was met by a strong opposition headed by that party of the Whigs which
had left office with Townshend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of Walpole.</div>

<p>In all the chief measures of his administration he found an eager
and at times a successful antagonist in Walpole. It was
chiefly through his instrumentality that the impeachment
of Oxford came to an untimely end. The Lords were persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_947" id="Page_947">[947]</a></span>
to refuse to listen to any evidence in support of the charge of misdemeanour
<span class="sidenote">Trial of Oxford. June 1717.</span> before they
had heard that on the graver charge of treason. They knew that it was
impossible for the Commons to support the more important charge. A
quarrel between the Houses ended in the refusal of the Lower House to
proceed to the impeachment. The Lords gravely assembled on the appointed
day in Westminster Hall, sat there for a quarter of an hour, and then, as
no accusers appeared, declared the impeachment at an end. Again, Walpole,
regardless of party ties, vehemently upheld the charges of peculation
brought against Lord Cadogan by the Jacobites in the House headed by
Shippen. And again, with great inconsistency,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETEEN_REPEAL_OF_THE_SCHISM_ACT" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETEEN_REPEAL_OF_THE_SCHISM_ACT"></a>Repeal of the Schism Act. Jan. 1719.</span>
he opposed the repeal of the Schism Act. The Act for restraining
Occasional Conformity passed in the last reign, and the Schism Act
of 1714, by which it had been followed, pressed very heavily on the
Dissenters; and Stanhope, whose views appear in some respects to have
been more liberal than those in vogue at the time, went so far in his
wish to relieve them as even to dream of mitigating the severity of
the Test and Corporation Acts. However, wisely yielding to the advice
of Sunderland, he confined himself to an attempt to get the Schism Act
repealed, and succeeded, after much opposition, in both Houses; but his
narrow majorities show that a more extensive measure would have been
useless. The Test Act continued in force, though rendered practically
nugatory after the beginning of George II.'s reign by a Bill of Indemnity
passed almost every year in favour of those who had evaded it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peerage Bill rejected. Dec. 1719.</div>

<p>On the two last named occasions Walpole's opposition had been useless.
On the more important question of the limitation of the power of the
Crown to create Peers by the Peerage Bill, he fortunately proved too
strong for the minister. Like the Septennial Act, the Peerage Bill was
introduced partly on theoretical, partly on party grounds. The Revolution
had been an aristocratic rather than a popular movement. The power or
rather the influence of the Crown had not been destroyed, but was in
abeyance, the Hanoverian monarchs being as it were in a state of tutelage
to the Whig party, whose strength was in the Upper House. Popular in
language, but aristocratic in feeling, this party regarded political
liberty as best secured by its own predominance, rendered permanent by
such institutions as a Septennial Parliament and an exclusive hereditary
nobility. It feared alike the power of the King and the power of the
people, and already the adoption of the Treaty of Utrecht, carried
by the popular will and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_948" id="Page_948">[948]</a></span>
by a large creation of Peers, had shown the possibility of a union
between King and people which might sooner or later destroy its
influence. To guard against such a danger was the primary object for
which Stanhope introduced his Peerage Bill. But temporary party interests
had as much weight with him as general theory. Stanhope and his friends,
especially Sunderland, were in dread of the conduct which might be
pursued by the Prince of Wales when he came to the throne. He was on bad
terms with his father, and regarded Sunderland as the chief cause of
the royal jealousy. It was generally believed that his accession would
be followed by a creation of peers from among his own favourites. Thus
both on public and party grounds the ministry thought it desirable to
limit the royal prerogative. As was natural, the Tories, in their dislike
to restrictions on the royal prerogative, and the party of Walpole,
who opposed it because it was a Government measure, made common cause
against the Bill. By its enactments the Crown was to be restrained from
the creation of more than six beyond the existing number of 178 English
peerages (the power of creating a new peerage whenever an old one became
extinct being reserved), no new peerage was to be created with remainders
except to the original recipient and his heirs male; while, to place
the Peerage of Scotland on the same footing, the sixteen representative
Peers of that country were to give way to twenty-five hereditary Peers
nominated by the Crown. The Bill met with little opposition in the House
of Lords, but was thrown out by a large majority in the Lower House,
where Walpole pointed out "that one of the most powerful incentives to
virtue would be taken away, since there would be no arriving at honour
but through the winding-sheet of a decrepit lord, or the grave of an
extinct noble family."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_STRENGTH_OF_THE_MINISTRY" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_STRENGTH_OF_THE_MINISTRY"></a>Strength of the ministry.</div>

<p>At the present time a defeat on so important a measure must have
driven the ministry from office. But the theory of party government was
as yet so little perfected, that not only did Stanhope retain his place,
but his administration was so strong, that the Whig malcontents thought
it better to renew their old connection with it, and both Walpole and
Townshend re-entered the Government, the one as Paymaster of the Forces,
the other as Lord President. It seemed as if nothing short of some great
convulsion could shake so powerful a Government, and, though little
apprehended, such a convulsion was near at hand.</p>

<p>It was still early in the history of finance. It was only of late
years that the moneyed interest had become so important in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_949" id="Page_949">[949]</a></span>
country as to admit of the discharge of the public liabilities by means
<span class="sidenote">The South Sea Scheme.</span> of large and regular
loans. But when once the practice had been begun it had been largely
adopted, and during the wars of the reign of Queen Anne the debt had
risen from sixteen to fifty-two millions. Ignorant of the resources of
the country and of the ease with which such a debt might be supported,
the financiers of the day were in constant terror of its rapid increase.
A member of the House, a certain Mr. Broderick, was expressing the
general feeling when he said, "I agree with the ministers, that until
the National Debt is discharged, or in a fair way of being so, we cannot
properly call ourselves a nation." But besides the general dread of the
amount of the debt, there was a very well-grounded dislike to the high
terms on which much of it had been contracted. The money having been
borrowed in time of war and difficulty, the terms offered to the lender
had been proportionately favourable. A settled Government, the success of
the Hanoverian succession, and the continued and rapid increase of wealth
which had followed it, had rendered money much cheaper, and Government
was paying seven or eight per cent. upon its loans, when private
individuals could borrow on good security at four per cent. But the
manner in which much of the money had been raised forbad any effort at
changing the rate of interest. The loans had been largely contracted in
the form of annuities, many of them for ninety-nine years; and of these
a considerable portion were irredeemable, that is to say, Government was
pledged to the payment of the interest as originally arranged, unless
some change could be made with the consent of the creditors.</p>

<p>Financiers had therefore two objects in view,&mdash;to lessen the whole
amount of debt, and to lower the interest payable on what remained.
The establishment of the Bank of England had shown the value, in
a mercantile point of view, of the Government credit. It became an
understood principle that money lent to Government, and thus
secured upon the credit of Government, was an excellent form of
capital; and when advances were required, or when it became convenient
to substitute a single great creditor for a number of little
ones, this principle had been brought into use. Two such attempts
had been made, the one by Harley in 1711, the other by Walpole in
1717. Harley, when Lord Treasurer, had found a floating debt
(a debt, that is, payable on demand of the creditor) of ten millions,
and had got rid of the danger of immediate demand by forming a
company of the creditors of this floating debt. The ten millions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_950" id="Page_950">[950]</a></span>
funded, that is, the interest and not the capital was paid; the interest
was secured upon the customs, and the fund of ten millions became
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_ELEVEN_FORMATION_OF_THE_SOUTH_SEA_COMPANY" id="SEVENTEEN_ELEVEN_FORMATION_OF_THE_SOUTH_SEA_COMPANY"></a>Formation of the South Sea Company. 1711.</span>
the capital of the company of creditors, who were induced to allow their
claims to be thus funded by the promise of the monopoly in the mercantile
advantage which Spain had granted England at Utrecht. This came to but
little,&mdash;the Assiento, or supply of slaves, and the admission of
a yearly ship of 500 tons burden to the American colonies. Even this
advantage was lost in the difficulties which arose with Alberoni. The
first ship did not sail till 1717, and as far as the South Sea trade went
Harley's plan was a failure. But the credit gained by the Company in
the transaction was good, other lines of trade were opened up, and the
Company became great, flourishing and powerful.</p>

<p>In 1717 Walpole had been very desirous to diminish the National
Debt. He established the first sinking fund, borrowing £600,000 at
only four per cent., using this money to pay off liabilities bearing a
higher interest, and applying the money thus saved to the extinction
of the debt. He also, taking advantage of the value of Government
credit, induced both the Bank and the South Sea Company to accept
a lower rate of interest for the money they had already advanced,
and to advance between them nearly £5,000,000 more, for the purpose
of paying off as far as possible those holders of redeemable debts
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_THE_SOUTH_SEA_SCHEME" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTY_THE_SOUTH_SEA_SCHEME"></a>The South Sea Scheme. 1720.</span> who refused to
accept the lowered rate of interest. The great South Sea Scheme of 1720
was in principle nothing but a repetition of this man&oelig;uvre. The South
Sea Company, believing devoutly in the power of credit, was anxious to
extend itself as far as possible. The Government was so eager for the
reduction of the debt that the King had made special mention of it in
the speech with which he opened Parliament in the close of 1719. Under
these circumstances the proposition of Blunt, director of the South
Sea Company, found a ready hearing with the ministers. Between them an
arrangement was devised, perfectly justifiable and harmless as far as
the principle of it went. The bulk of the Government debt consisted in
redeemable and irredeemable annuities, on all of which large interest
was paid, and on which that interest must continue to be paid unless
the holder of the annuity voluntarily reduced it. There is said to have
been about sixteen millions of each class of security. Government wished
to bring the whole mass into one general fund, bearing a lower rate of
interest, and the South Sea Company was so greedy of the Government
credit, that it expressed itself anxious to add the whole of this
enormous amount to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_951" id="Page_951">[951]</a></span>
capital. It is plain that any transaction of the sort, as far as regarded
the irredeemable annuities, must have been entirely voluntary. All
that the Government could do was to allow the Company to persuade
the holders to exchange their annuities for shares in the Company.
With regard to the holders of redeemable annuities, payment in full
must be offered, but that payment might be given in shares of the
Company. In other words, those who accepted the exchange became
proprietors in the Joint-stock South Sea Company to the amount of
their claim on the Government. With regard to the Government,
the South Sea Company alone became creditor, instead of a multitude
of old annuitants, and was contented to receive henceforward, instead
of the seven or eight per cent. the annuitants had received, five per
cent. till the year 1727, and after that four per cent. till the capital
as well as the interest should be returned, for the fund was made a
redeemable one. If the transaction were thoroughly successful the
capital of the South Sea Company would be increased by about thirty-two
millions, advanced to Government at five per cent., and Government
would have to pay five per cent. interest instead of seven or
eight, besides having the power of redeeming the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Competition of other companies.</div>

<p>So great were the advantages understood to be gained by this accession
of capital in Government hands, that other companies wished to share
in them. It was voted by a large majority that these advantages should
be put up to public competition. The Bank of England and the South Sea
Company set to work outbidding each other, the latter finally proposing
terms which were virtually a payment to Government of seven millions
and a half. This money was to be devoted to the public service, to pay
off debts contracted to the end of the year 1722, and after that as
much as possible of the capital of the South Sea Company itself. It is
plain that for the success of this scheme two things were requisite. In
the first place, a readiness on the part of the public to accept the
Company's shares in exchange for their Government annuities; without that
Government would not be freed, nor would the Company get its increased
capital. But this exchange would of course bring in no ready money.
Secondly, therefore, a large number of new shareholders would be required
to subscribe, paying for their shares in ready money, in order to meet
the demands of those holders of redeemable annuities who refused all
exchange, and to cover the heavy premium of £7,000,000. Now both of these
objects were dependent on the popularity of the Company's shares;
and it was in this that the mistake of the arrangement lay; Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_952" id="Page_952">[952]</a></span>
had in fact made too good a bargain. By an extensive system of bribes
large sums of fictitious capital were invented and distributed gratis
among influential members of the Government, and still more largely among
the hungry Hanoverian courtiers, whose influence it was regarded as all
important to secure. All fear of the success of the scheme was almost
immediately removed. So great was the belief in the vast Company, backed
up by this huge accession of Government credit, so well had the directors
done their business, that a very large majority of the annuitants pressed
with extreme haste to accept the terms offered, though those terms were
very low. The public were then invited to subscribe the new capital. Five
separate subscriptions of upwards of a million were in succession opened,
and all filled, with equal rapidity.</p>

<p>It was however in its secondary effects, rather than in its immediate
consequences, that the scheme exerted the most extraordinary influence.
There was a great deal of money in the country, and there was no
satisfactory way of using it. Much had been hoarded, for there were not
then as now numerous industrial investments in the market in which small
sums could be employed. The apparent <span class="sidenote">The rage
for stock-jobbing.</span> success of the South Sea Company, and the
promises which it held out for rapid fortune-making, excited the spirit
of speculation to the highest degree, and companies sprang into existence
with unexampled rapidity. Some were real and serious&mdash;waterworks,
paving companies, and companies for the improvement of all branches of
manufacture. Some were mere transparent impostures&mdash;as a company
for the importation of Spanish donkeys, for the fixing of quicksilver,
or for wheels of perpetual motion. It did not matter much what they
were, for the rage for stock-jobbing was such that any hardy promoter
of a company might hope to float it at all events till he had himself
realized a handsome fortune. Change Alley became a scene of the wildest
excitement&mdash;people in all lines of life hurrying to buy and sell as
during the railway mania of our own time. But among all the companies
the South Sea Company maintained its pre-eminence, and its shares rose,
till in August the £100 share was worth £1000. The Company continued to
promise largely, even fifty per cent. profits. The absurdity and danger
of such reckless proceedings began to become obvious. The nominal value
of all the shares in all the companies then existing was held to be
£500,000,000, or twice the value of all the land in England. But many of
these companies, being unchartered, were illegal, and had no right to issue shares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_953" id="Page_953">[953]</a></span>
and the legitimate companies, especially the South Sea, looked with
jealousy at their illegal competitors. Apparently unconscious how much
their own success depended upon the universal delusion, they
<span class="sidenote">Bursting of the bubble.</span> proceeded to
prosecute some companies which had acted illegally. The effect was
instantaneous. The nation began to return to its senses; the bubble
burst, and the stocks of all unchartered companies fell with extreme
rapidity. In the universal ruin they carried with them the South Sea
Company. The panic was as rapid as the eagerness to purchase had
been. Before the end of September South Sea stock was at 175. The
difference between that sum and the £1000 which they had touched will
give some measure of the loss involved. The ruin among all classes was
unspeakable.</p>

<p>So great was the desolation that it was found necessary for
Parliament to intervene. Not that the great Company itself was in
any way bankrupt, its shares were still at a large premium, they
never fell below 175; not that any law of political economy had
been broken; Government had never pledged itself to support the
credit of the Company, or to force either its shares or its engagements
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYONE_PUNISHMENT_OF_THE_DIRECTORS" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYONE_PUNISHMENT_OF_THE_DIRECTORS"></a>Punishment of the directors.</span> on the public;
but simply because private speculation had caused so vast an amount
of misery, and because the nation was exasperated at it, interference
became absolutely necessary. Examination into all the details of the
plan no doubt proved a considerable amount of venality on the part of
the ministry, of bribery and fraud on the part of the directors. But
even thus it was freely acknowledged that under no old law had any crime
been committed, and it required a retrospective Act of Parliament and
the creation of a temporary crime to bring the directors within the
reach of punishment. As Gibbon said, the steps taken were in fact an
act of popular vengeance and contrary to justice. They consisted in the
appropriation of the private property of the directors to the amount
of £2,000,000 for distribution among the sufferers, the remission of
the £7,000,000 due by the Company to Government, the payment of all the
just liabilities to the Company, and a division of the capital that then
remained, about thirty-three per cent., among the proprietors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supremacy of Walpole. 1721.</div>

<p>These measures are due exclusively to Walpole, the one man specially
fitted from his financial abilities to deal with the present crisis, and
in whose favour it was remembered that he had been out of office when the
plan was set on foot. The official inquiries into the circumstances of the South Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_954" id="Page_954">[954]</a></span>
Scheme left him indeed in a position of undisputed supremacy in the
House. Several members of the Government were implicated in the frauds of
the Company; Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was found guilty
and expelled the House. The younger Craggs died of smallpox before the
inquiry was completed, and his father committed suicide. Charles Stanhope
was acquitted by a majority of three only, and although Sunderland was
declared innocent by a large majority, public opinion was so strong
against him that he had to leave the ministry. In the following year
he died. During the angry debates which arose on these matters Lord
Stanhope had been attacked with virulence by the Duke of Wharton, and
the anger which he had felt had been such as to cause a rush of blood to
the head, of which he died shortly before his relative Charles Stanhope
was acquitted. There remained no possible rival to Walpole, who with his
brother-in-law Townshend returned to power as First Lord of the Treasury.
Thus, when the new Parliament assembled, he found himself absolute master
of the field, at the head of an unbroken Whig party, supported by an
overwhelming majority, and for twenty years maintained his position,
to the immense advantage of England and to the lasting security of the
reigning house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of Jacobite hopes.</div>

<p>Not that the Jacobites were as yet extinct, but they were silenced
in Parliament, and had to rely upon conspiracy or foreign assistance.
Their hopes in fact were at this moment in some respects higher than
ever, for the disturbance and discontent caused by the collapse of the
South Sea Scheme, together with the birth of an heir to the House of
Stuart in the person of Prince Charles Edward, seemed to afford them an
opportunity for greater activity. The Stuart papers prove the existence
of a well-organized intrigue, under the management of a Committee of
five, Lord Orrery, the Earl of Arran Lord Orford's brother, Lord North,
Lord Gower, and Atterbury Bishop of Rochester. The letters display
in a very curious manner the false hopes with which the party were
constantly buoyed up. Atterbury indeed showed signs of considerable
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYTWO_BISHOP_ATTERBURYS_PLOT" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYTWO_BISHOP_ATTERBURYS_PLOT"></a>Bishop Atterbury's plot.</span> wisdom, the
reintroduction of Walpole and Townshend to the ministry seemed to him
a great blow to the cause. "The reconciliation," he writes, "is not
yet hearty and sincere, but I apprehend it will by degrees become so.
The Tories have no good foundation on which to stand. Disaffection and
uneasiness will continue everywhere, and probably increase. The bulk of
the nation will be ever in the true interest and on the side of justice.
The present settlement will perhaps be detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_955" id="Page_955">[955]</a></span>
every day more and more, and yet no effectual step will or can be taken
to shake it." The great South Sea Scheme also seemed to him a difficulty.
"That body of men, who have increased their capital by £40,000,000, begin
to look formidable. They cannot but be the governors of the kingdom." He
therefore urged instant action before the Whig settlement had time to
ripen or the financial plans to be brought to successful conclusion. Even
a few years later the Earl of Orrery wrote, "It is not an extravagant
computation that four out of five of the whole nation wish well to
you." Nevertheless all these Jacobite writers were obliged to confess,
even after the failure of the scheme, that the united Whigs were too
powerful, and the general prudence of all classes too great, to allow
of any successful movement without assistance from abroad. It is plain
also that there were numerous sections and much want of discipline in the
Jacobite camp. Atterbury's influence was disapproved of by many; Gower
had a band of followers of his own; and James was so alive to this source
of weakness that he earnestly pressed for the election of a responsible
head, naming the Earl of Oxford as the fittest person for the purpose.
These divisions, and the want of self-reliance in the face of the
powerful Government, constantly prevented the <span class="sidenote">Failure of the conspiracy.</span>
Jacobites from obtaining success; their agents were perpetually
soliciting foreign countries for help, and the chain of foreign diplomacy
which Stanhope had wrought was so close, that such ill-advised requests
could scarcely fail to reach the ears of the English ministry. Thus a
determination to take advantage of the confusion caused by the South Sea
Scheme, by the death of Stanhope, which was supposed to have broken the
link with France, and by the new election for Parliament, was brought
to Walpole's knowledge. The Regent had been asked to supply 5000 men,
but Dubois was not likely to overthrow the diplomatic edifice he had so
carefully built up. He at once informed the English minister at Paris.
And at the opening of the new Parliament George was able to give a short
summary of the conspiracy, involving an expedition headed by James and
Ormond from Spain and Italy, the seizure of the Tower, the Bank and the
Exchequer, and the declaration in London of King James; and at the same
time he could state that some of the chiefs, especially the Bishop of
Rochester, were already under arrest.</p>

<p>The superiority of the Whig party was now shown in the Bills
that were passed relative to this conspiracy. The Habeas Corpus
Act was suspended for a whole year, the longest time on record;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_956" id="Page_956">[956]</a></span>
sums were granted for an increase of the army; a tax of £100,000,
to be collected from all Nonjurors, was enacted; and as the evidence
was scarcely sufficient to go before a Court of Law, Bills of Pains
and Penalties were introduced against some of the subordinate
agents, and against Atterbury himself, who was forced to leave
the kingdom. At Calais he met Bolingbroke, who had just
received his pardon and was returning to England. He had
been dismissed by the Pretender after the failure of 1715, and
had vowed never again to serve so ungrateful a master. None
the less did he continue for the rest of his life to hamper by his
intrigues the Whig party. The chief cause of his irritation was
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_QUARREL_BETWEEN_CARTERET_AND_WALPOLE" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_QUARREL_BETWEEN_CARTERET_AND_WALPOLE"></a>Quarrel between Carteret and Walpole.</span>
that his overtures were rejected by Walpole, who already began to show
that thirst for power and jealousy of men of great talents which was one
of his marked characteristics, and which was the ultimate cause of his
fall. Carteret, who with Townshend was now Secretary of State, was his
first victim&mdash;a man of the most brilliant parts and of unrivalled
knowledge of foreign affairs. He had succeeded to much of the influence
as well as to the views of Stanhope. Abroad he was inclined to plunge
England into the complications of Hanoverian policy. It was in fact
natural that with his great knowledge of foreign affairs he should be
led to consider them more important than other English statesmen, who
then as now were inclined towards a policy of isolation. At home, too,
his views were less exclusively those of a Whig partisan than those of
his fellow ministers. He feared probably less than the occasion demanded
the strength of the Jacobites. He looked upon the sole possession of
power by the Whigs on the Hanoverian succession as a necessary but only
temporary evil. He was desirous of a far larger admission of the Tory
element, and would willingly have admitted Bolingbroke and those Tories
who would have accompanied him among the ranks of the ministry, or at all
events among the ranks of the ministerial supporters. But to Walpole such
views were exceedingly distasteful. He well knew Bolingbroke's ability
and feared him as a personal rival. He felt also that if Bolingbroke were
instrumental in destroying the Tory opposition, the King could not but
feel under considerable obligations to him, and that his own exclusive
influence would be shaken. Bolingbroke's overtures were therefore most
coldly received, and he withdrew again to Paris, where an intrigue was
going on, in which he took a prominent part, and which ended in the fall
of his friend Carteret. The intrigue itself was of a very despicable
character, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_957" id="Page_957">[957]</a></span>
was connected with the marriage of a daughter of Madame de Platen,
sister of the King's mistress, the Countess of Darlington. To counteract
Carteret, who was employing the English ambassador in the Countess's
interest, Townshend sent Horace Walpole as his agent to Paris. The
existence of two rival ambassadors, one only properly accredited, brought
matters to a crisis. The King, in spite of a strong personal friendship
for Carteret, was obliged to yield to the influence of Walpole, and his
rival had to withdraw to the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_EXCITEMENT_IN_IRELAND" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_EXCITEMENT_IN_IRELAND"></a>Excitement in Ireland.</div>

<p>But although the office given to Carteret was regarded as a
retirement, in the present instance it promised to be no sinecure.
Ireland was in a state of wild excitement, lashed to fury by the
exceedingly able but untrue writings of Swift, who in his Drapier's
Letters had by exaggeration and falsehood given an aspect of tyrannical
misgovernment to a commonplace and legitimate financial act. There was
great need of a new small coinage for Ireland, and Walpole had given
a patent in 1722 to a certain William Wood, giving him power to coin
farthings and halfpence to the value of £108,000. The contract and
quality had been declared satisfactory by Sir Isaac Newton, Master of
the Mint. The Irish Parliament declared that the patent would occasion a
loss to the nation of one hundred and fifty per cent., an extraordinary
assertion based upon the fact that a pound of rough copper in Ireland
was worth twelve pence, while a pound of coined fine copper was to be
worth thirty pence. But the mint in London gave eighteenpence a pound
for its copper. The charge of coinage was fourpence, the duties upon
copper imported into Ireland were twenty per cent., and the difference of
exchange between England and Ireland rendered a slight diminution of the
weight reasonable. Of course, however, it is certain that the patentee
made something by the bargain, especially as the voracious Duchess of
Kendal had been bribed to obtain it. But all facts and all reasoning were
useless against the storm raised by Swift's Letters, and it was not till
Walpole had exhibited his usual prudence in accepting inevitable defeat,
and cancelling the patent, that Ireland was quieted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYFIVE_DISTURBANCES_IN_SCOTLAND" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYFIVE_DISTURBANCES_IN_SCOTLAND"></a>Disturbances in Scotland. 1725.</div>

<p>It was not in Ireland only that the financial measures of Walpole
met with opposition. For years the tax upon malt had been with great
difficulty collected in Scotland. This tax had been changed into a charge
of threepence upon every barrel of ale. Edinburgh was in commotion, and
the brewers refused to brew. Lord Isla, the Duke of Argyle's brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_958" id="Page_958">[958]</a></span>
was acting as Walpole's agent in the matter. He prudently declined to
interfere, certain that love of profit would speedily break up the
combination. A public meeting, Walpole tells us, was held, and the
question put by the chairman, "Brew or not brew?" He began by asking the
man on his right hand. But he and many who followed him refused to vote,
till at last one bolder than the rest refused to be bound by the majority
and voted "Brew." The assembly broke up in some confusion, but before
morning there were forty brewhouses hard at work in Edinburgh and ten in
Leith.</p>

<p>The remainder of the reign offers but little of interest in domestic
history, but before Walpole could enter unchecked on that course of
peaceful policy which is the chief characteristic of his long tenure of
office, he had yet one difficulty with Spain to overcome, while at
home there was already springing up that opposition of discontented
Whigs combined with the Tory party, which, under the fostering
influence of Bolingbroke behind the scenes, and led in Parliament
by the ability of Pulteney, formed the formidable opposition to
<span class="sidenote">Spanish difficulties. 1725.</span> which Walpole
ultimately succumbed. Since the adhesion of Spain to the Quadruple
Alliance and the fall of Alberoni, a Congress had been sitting at Cambrai
to arrange the details of the final settlement of Europe. The chief
points at issue were the renunciation of the title of King of Spain, to
which the Austrian Empire fondly clung, the Grand Mastership of the Order
of the Golden Fleece, which the Emperor also claimed, and the restoration
to their owners of certain Italian provinces of which the Emperor had
taken possession. To gain these ends, Spain, absolutely renouncing the
policy of Alberoni, attached itself closely to France and England,
purchased the favour of the latter country by a treaty of commerce,
renewing the Assiento and the annual ship to the Spanish colonies, and
of the former by a marriage-treaty. This marriage-treaty Orleans was
induced to accept in pursuance of his plan for keeping continual hold of
the regency; all views of ultimate succession were gradually fading from
him as the young King improved in health. It was a threefold arrangement;
the Infanta Mary Anne, then only three years old, was to marry Louis XV.,
the two daughters of the Regent were to marry the Prince of Asturias,
heir to the Spanish crown, and Don Carlos, presumptive heir to Parma and
Tuscany. Spain had thus done so much that she awaited with confidence the
meeting of the Congress at Cambrai. But that Congress was very slow in
its operations, and the hasty Queen of Spain and her ambitious husband
began to weary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_959" id="Page_959">[959]</a></span>
ill success of their concessions, and to think that perhaps after all
matters might be brought to a more speedy termination by direct action,
without mediators, at the court of Vienna. The Spanish Government was
the more inclined to this step, because it had been persuaded that the
Austrian court would lend no unwilling ear to direct negotiations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues of Ripperda.</div>

<p>This belief had been forced upon the King and Queen by a strange,
adventurous, but very able foreigner, who was rapidly rising into
somewhat the same position in Spain that Alberoni had held. This was
the Baron Ripperda. A Dutchman by origin, a soldier by profession, he
was unusually well versed in the details of business and of political
economy. He had taken up all Alberoni's views as to the possible
expansion of the resources of Spain, and, thinking there was more
room for his ability in that country than in Holland, had had himself
naturalized there. He followed the King during his temporary resignation
of the Spanish throne, and returned with him on his son's death to the
possession of full power. There seems little doubt that throughout
Ripperda had been in the pay of the Austrian court, and it was chiefly
at his instigation that the Congress at Cambrai was deserted and direct
negotiations between the courts opened. He had set before the King and
Queen very plausible reasons not only for a negotiation but for a change
of policy, no less complete than an entire desertion of the mediating
Powers and of the principle of the Quadruple Alliance, and a close
friendship with the House of Austria. Spain would thus be freed from the
constant encroachments of England upon her trade, and the interference of
France, which had been very irksome to the Spaniards since the Bourbon
accession, would be avoided. The old question of the Barrier Treaty was
exciting the animosity of England and Austria; for Austria, in distinct
contravention of the commercial articles of that treaty, which forbade
to the Austrian Netherlands the trade of India, had established a great
Ostend India Company. And there was another object very dear to the
Emperor's heart towards which Spain could lend important aid. It could
guarantee the Pragmatic Sanction, pledge itself, that is, to preserve
the Austrian succession to the daughter of the Emperor, a pledge which
in the case of Spain meant a great deal, as Spain had fair claims to a
considerable portion of the succession on the extinction of the direct
male line of the Austrian house. With these hopes and with these offers
Ripperda set out for Vienna, with the intention of entirely
destroying the present arrangements of Europe, of breaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_960" id="Page_960">[960]</a></span>
existing marriage-treaty with the Orleans princesses, of substituting
for them the Austrian archduchesses, and of restoring Europe to
its ancient attitude by the close alliance of Austria and Spain in
opposition to France and England.</p>

<p>The success of Ripperda's scheme, the completion of his great act of
treachery, was rapidly secured by an act of a very similar description
on the part of the Duke of Bourbon. That prince had an almost
insane dread of the possible succession of the Orleans house to the
French throne; to preclude its possibility he desired the immediate
marriage of the young king. But his betrothed Spanish bride was
but a baby; regardless therefore of all treaty obligations, the Duke
sent her back almost without explanation to Spain, and married the
young King to Maria Leczinska, daughter of the ex-King of Poland.
The rage of the Spanish king knew no bounds; he sent peremptory
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Vienna. April 30, 1725.</span> orders
to Ripperda to bring the treaty with Austria to a conclusion upon any
terms. Under these circumstances the great Treaty of Vienna was made on
the 30th of April 1725. It consisted of three separate treaties, two
public and one private. By the public treaties the Pragmatic Sanction was
guaranteed; the Spanish ports opened to German commerce; the succession
of Parma and Tuscany promised to Don Carlos; and Austria pledged herself
to use her best influence to secure the restoration of Gibraltar and
Minorca. Had this been all it would have been fair enough, somewhat
humiliating to the countries left negotiating uselessly at Cambrai, but
not otherwise than in accordance with the principles of the Quadruple
Alliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The secret treaty.</div>

<p>On the supposition that there was no secret treaty the English
Opposition desired that no notice might be taken of the transaction,
and reprobated the action of the Government in forming a counter treaty
as Hanoverian. But there can be little doubt that there was a secret
treaty. Its tenor was afterwards disclosed by Ripperda. In it the
marriages between the two houses were arranged; Austria and Spain pledged
themselves to assist the restoration of the Stuarts; and to compel,
if necessary by force, the restoration of Gibraltar and Minorca. The
existence of this treaty before long reached the ears of the English
ministers. For some little time the Jacobites had been extremely active.
An envoy had come to rouse the loyalty of the clans, and had found them
not disinclined to revolt; and the Duke of Wharton, one of the Jacobite
leaders, had gone abroad and held ostentatiously secret meetings with
Ripperda. Ripperda's own tongue was none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_961" id="Page_961">[961]</a></span>
quietest, and he boasted constantly of his great plans. The threat
against the power of England was rendered more dangerous by the attitude
of Russia, where the Empress Catherine, who was receiving large subsidies
from the Spanish court, was eager to win for her son-in-law the Duke of
Holstein the province of Sleswig, which the Danes had taken from him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYSIX_THE_TREATY_OF_HANOVER" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYSIX_THE_TREATY_OF_HANOVER"></a>The Treaty of Hanover.</div>

<p>To meet this threatening alliance therefore, on the 3rd of September,
the counter Treaty of Hanover was signed between England, France and
Prussia, for mutual assistance should either of the countries be
attacked. The real intention was to compel the Emperor to relinquish
the Ostend Company, and to withstand any attempt on the part of the
Pretender. Ripperda had returned in triumph to Madrid; but his success
was shortlived. He found himself unable to fulfil the promises he had
made to the Austrians; the people of Spain hated him; he was driven
from office, and had to seek refuge at the British embassy, where his
confessions completely justified the precautions the Government had taken
in bringing about the Treaty of Hanover. In spite of his fall the treaty
he had arranged still continued effective.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excitement of Europe.</div>

<p>It seemed as if Europe was upon the verge of a great war, divided as
of old into North and South, Protestant and Catholic. The indignation
excited by the Treaty of Vienna in England was very great. As it was
well put in the King's speech, it appeared as if the appropriation of
the English trade was to be given to one country, and Gibraltar and Port
Mahon to another, as a price for assisting the Stuart Pretender to the
English throne. Very large subsidies were granted, and the army and navy
increased. A British squadron blockaded Porto Bello, another squadron
entered the Baltic to overawe the Russians; the Spanish galleons were
seized. The foolish publication of a direct appeal from the Emperor of
Austria to the English people excited the anger even of the Opposition,
and secured the speedy dismissal of Palm, the Austrian ambassador. A
Spanish army proceeded to invest Gibraltar.</p>

<p>But the skilful though selfish policy of Prussia, and the pacific
tendencies of Walpole and of the new French minister Fleury, produced an
arrangement. The Emperor found that his position was becoming dangerous.
Prussia, at once the leader of the princely opposition to the Imperial
house, and yet thoroughly German in its tendencies, determined to be
neutral. It could not assist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_962" id="Page_962">[962]</a></span>
Emperor in supporting a treaty which by its marriage clauses
threatened to put a Spanish prince on the Imperial throne. The
King had hopes of gaining from France some portion of the Juliers
succession. But the house of Brandenburg had become of great
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_PRELIMINARIES_OF_PEACE" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_PRELIMINARIES_OF_PEACE"></a>Preliminaries of peace. May 31, 1727.</span>
importance in European politics; neither party could well act without
it. Its neutrality induced the Emperor to consent to the signature of
preliminaries of peace, signed at Paris on the 31st of May 1727. He
agreed to suspend the Ostend Company for seven years, and to refer other
disputes to the general Congress. The pacific policy which had produced
this arrangement was Walpole's. The skill which had formed the Treaty of
Hanover, the dread of which had undoubtedly produced the peace, belonged
to Townshend. And here began the ill-feeling between the brothers-in-law
which ultimately produced the disruption of their friendship.</p>

<p>The period of this exciting foreign crisis was rendered interesting
in England by the rising power of the Opposition to Walpole. At
the back of that Opposition was constantly Bolingbroke. Enormous
bribes had secured for him the favour of the Duchess of
<span class="sidenote">Opposition to Walpole headed by Bolingbroke.</span>
Kendal. Great stress had been brought to bear on Walpole to consent to
his complete restitution. But Walpole would go no further than to allow
a restoration of property, the attainder and consequent exclusion from
the House of Peers was kept constantly suspended over his head. His
anger against the minister who thus thwarted him knew no bounds. He set
himself to work to form an Opposition. William Pulteney, an old friend
of Walpole's, but like Carteret cast off as too able, lent himself to
Bolingbroke's plans, and became his mouthpiece in the House of Commons.
Between them they established the Opposition paper, the <i>Craftsman</i>, and
under their influence every measure of the Government was vigorously
attacked by the Jacobite or Whig members. Underhand intrigue promised to
be even more effectual than overt opposition. The Duchess of Kendal, by
dint of bribing, had grown to be zealous in the cause of the Opposition.
She was constantly at work on the King, urging the full restoration of
Bolingbroke, urging even the admission of him and his friends to the
ministry, and the dismissal of Walpole. George indeed held bravely to his
old minister. He showed him the insidious attacks which the Duchess put
into his hands, and allowed him thus to meet and counteract them. But
Walpole himself felt that the constant importunity of the favourite
would sooner or later have its effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_963" id="Page_963">[963]</a></span>
He was even, it is said, thinking of withdrawing to the Upper
<span class="sidenote">The King's death. June 9, 1727.</span> House, when
the King's death at Osnabrück, on his return home from Hanover, put an
end for a moment to the almost successful intrigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Review of the reign.</div>

<p>England had been singularly fortunate in escaping the dangers
which generally accompany a violent change of dynasty.
The attention of the new Government is usually so
constantly directed towards the maintenance of its position in the
face of the eager opposition of its worsted rivals, that it neglects the
external interests of the country, and the nation sinks for a time
into insignificance. In the first days of the Revolution the nation
had fortunately fallen into the hands of a great statesman, whose
wide policy, carried out with consummate ability by the Duke of
<span class="sidenote">Increased importance of England abroad.</span>
Marlborough, had raised it to a very high position. At Utrecht it had
treated as one of the first European nations. The skill of Stanhope had
secured the prestige thus won. It was England which was the chief power
of the Quadruple Alliance, her fleet in the Mediterranean which gave the
first great blow to the plans of Alberoni. Twice the appearance of her
fleet in the Baltic had overawed the North, and when the new European
combination brought about by the Treaty of Vienna had threatened the
existing arrangements of Europe, it was the diplomacy of England which
called into existence the counter Treaty of Hanover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Private and public immorality.</div>

<p>At home the survey of the reign is not so satisfactory. There was deep
depravity in both domestic and public life. The licentiousness which
had marked the whole Stuart period had lost nothing of its wickedness,
but a good deal of its elegance, in its union with the corruption of
a small German court. With a king without wit, without taste for the
arts, without knowledge of literature, without perception of beauty, and
swayed by two ugly, ignorant and rapacious mistresses, we hear with no
surprise tales of the coarseness of the time. If possible, the depravity
of public life was greater than the private immorality. It is enough to
mark the character of the reign that the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Macclesfield, was towards its close convicted of disgracing the seat
of justice by receiving bribes, and was removed with ignominy from his
office; that three ministers at least, if not more, were compromised in
the iniquitous transactions of the South Sea Company, and that the King's
mistress amassed an immense fortune from the bribes by which her favour
was purchased. But even worse than this shameless venality was the
political infidelity which universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_964" id="Page_964">[964]</a></span>
prevailed. It is this which is the real danger of a disputed succession.
There is an uncertainty as to which party may ultimately be successful,
which engenders a spirit of political gambling, while for any fancied
insults, or any real loss of power, immediate revenge can be sought
by a mere transfer, and frequently a secret transfer of allegiance.
To this may be added the tendency of compulsory oaths, which men
persuade themselves that they may accept as a matter of form, and which
therefore weaken all sense of conscientious engagements. There was
hardly a statesman of note who had not more or less tampered with the
Jacobite party. Even Walpole is not quite clear of the charge, while
the whole body of High Tories were in constant danger of drifting into
Jacobitism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the Hanoverian courtiers.</div>

<p>Nor was this the only cause leading to low political morality. The
reigning King was a foreigner in all his habits and in all his tastes.
He was surrounded by a Hanoverian court, who regarded England as an
instrument for the aggrandizement of Hanover, and formed a centre for all
intrigues to win the royal favour at the expense of patriotism. It is
strange, indeed, that their influence was less directly felt in English
politics, and it is perhaps owing to those very Hanoverian predilections
of the King, which are so often urged against him, that their influence
was not greater. He was so thoroughly German in language and in thought,
he was so incapable of comprehending the English Constitution and
manners, that his real interests were entirely centred on his Hanoverian
dominions, and in all matters in which they were not concerned he left
England to work out its own revolution, and was compelled, moreover, to
throw himself wholly into the hands of that party on whom the revolution
rested, and with whom it was a matter of life and death to secure the
completion of that revolution, and to maintain the security of the
Parliamentary King. It was fortunate that that party was guided by the
wisdom of Walpole. That jealousy of power which was his chief weakness
was itself an advantage, since it tended to exclude from power the Tory
party, and gave a united character to the Government, which proved the
hopelessness of success to all who did not accept it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walpole retains his position.</div>

<p><span class="first drop">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> ascendancy of Walpole
was in great jeopardy on the death of George I. Bolingbroke's intrigues
against him, backed by all the influence of the Duchess of Kendal, had
indeed been thwarted by the straightforward manner in which George I.
had put all complaints against him into the minister's own hands&mdash;a
striking instance of that love of justice and fidelity to old friends
which were the redeeming traits of his otherwise uninteresting character.
But Walpole had now to do with a sovereign whom as Prince of Wales he
had always opposed, and who had been known to use strong expressions of
disapprobation with regard to him. George II., a little, dry man, gifted
with the hereditary bravery and obstinacy of his family, but with very
limited abilities, and a mind far more easily touched by little things
than by broad interests, could not be expected to forget Walpole's
opposition, nor to appreciate his calm, tolerant wisdom. When Walpole
brought him the news of his father's death, he was at once directed
to apply to Sir Spencer Compton, a dull, orderly man, Speaker of the
House of Commons and Treasurer to the Prince of Wales. Walpole was wise
enough to profess friendship for the new favourite, who even employed
the ability of his predecessor to draw up the speech which the King was
to deliver to the Council. For some days it was believed that Walpole's
power was gone. His usual throng of followers deserted him and crowded
to Sir Spencer Compton's levée. But before any definite arrangements had
been made, Sir Spencer unwisely gave Walpole opportunities for personally
explaining himself to the King. He was thus able to remove the bad
impression the King had received as to his foreign policy, and to outbid
his rivals in the arrangements he proposed to make for the Civil List, a
point very close to the King's heart. He completely succeeded in winning
the Queen to his interests; and when she heard that Compton had had to
appeal to his assistance in arranging the speech from the throne, she
took the opportunity of impressing upon George the absurdity of employing
a minister who was obliged to lean for support upon his rival. The
Queen's influence, which was very great, turned the scale in his favour.
The ministry continued unchanged. Compton, feeling his brief importance
at an end, withdrew from the contest, and shortly afterwards accepted the
position of President of the Council as Lord Wilmington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of the Civil List.</div>

<p>The offer which had proved so effective a means for securing
Walpole's power consisted of £130,000 to the Civil List,
and a jointure of £100,000 to Queen Caroline. The Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_967" id="Page_967">[967]</a></span>
List, which had been settled after the Revolution at £700,000 a year
from all sources, had proved insufficient, saddled as it then was with
a variety of expenses, such as the judges' and ambassadors' salaries,
beyond the mere expenses of the Court. Anne had been £1,200,000 in debt,
George I. £1,000,000. Walpole now offered to induce the House to raise it
to £800,000 a year, allowing the King to claim anything beyond that sum
which should arise from the hereditary revenues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The influence of the Queen.</div>

<p>Before long Walpole won the entire confidence of the King himself, but
it was at first chiefly on the friendship of the Queen that he relied.
She was a woman of very considerable ability. Her intellectual fault
indeed was an attempt to know too much. She collected around her men
of learning of all sorts, dabbled in divinity, dabbled in metaphysics,
patronized poetry, and delighted in listening to theological discussions,
in which she kept the part of strict neutrality, believing it is thought
but little on either side. But her influence in bringing forward men
of ability, especially in the Church, was very great. Her sense was
excellent, and by means of it, in spite of the King's royal immorality,
she contrived to rule him absolutely. She thoroughly appreciated Walpole,
and together they pursued that policy, which was no doubt the right one
<span class="sidenote">Character of Walpole's ministry.</span>
for the maintenance of the Hanoverian succession. This consisted in the
pursuit of peace in every direction&mdash;peace abroad, peace at home.
If any point was strongly contested it was given up; if any abuse was
unobserved it was suffered to rest untouched; and in general their object
was to let the nation learn by its material prosperity the advantages of
an orderly and settled Government. As a consequence of this policy the
period of Walpole's government was uneventful, and was occupied rather
with the great Parliamentary struggle between himself and the Opposition
under Pulteney than by any great national affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the Opposition.</div>

<p>The chief strength of that Opposition consisted of the discontented
Whigs, most of whom were driven to oppose Walpole by his insatiable love
of power. We have already seen Pulteney and Carteret forced from the
ranks of the Government, and all overtures with Bolingbroke rejected.
In 1730, Walpole quarrelled with his old friend and brother-in-law
Townshend, who was only restrained by his patriotism from joining the
Opposition. In 1733, Lord Chesterfield was added to the list. These
leaders had behind them a certain quantity of supporters who took the name of Patriots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_968" id="Page_968">[968]</a></span>
and wished to be regarded as the true old Whigs, looking upon Walpole
with his large majority as seceders from them. There was much
plausibility in this view: for the Whig party under Walpole seemed to
have become closely attached to the Crown, and was supported principally
by Crown influence. As the original principle of the Whigs had been
antagonism to the over-great power of the Crown, it could be plausibly
urged that they had now assumed the position of their former enemies.
The Hanoverian line had ascended the throne with a parliamentary as
contrasted with a hereditary title; it had therefore naturally found its
chief supporters among the Whigs. With the Hanoverians that party had
entered upon power. But the Revolution, while practically subordinating
the power of the King to that of Parliament, had constitutionally left
it untouched. The Hanoverian kings did not indeed employ it to its full,
but placed it in the hands of the minister, who, by means of the royal
influence, practically ruled England with as unquestioned a sway as any
great minister of the Stuarts. The difference lay in this, that the power
of the Crown consisted in the immense influence it possessed by means of
pensions, places, and the command of the public money, and worked through
the House of Commons, and not in opposition to it. The patriot Whigs were
conscious of the power of the Crown, and were true to their principles
in opposing it. Their error lay in this, that they did not understand
that that power was formidable only so long as there was a venal House
of Commons. Eager as they thought for liberty, they formed a close
connection with the High Tories and Jacobites, the greatest enemies of
liberty; and in their eagerness for office did their best to oppose that
Government, which for the present, at all events, was the only safeguard
against the restoration of the Stuarts, for the events of 1745 render
it plain that danger from the Jacobites was as yet by no means over.
In fact, however, principle had little to do with the matter, it was
personal animosity to the minister, and anger at exclusion from office,
which inspired the Opposition. Even the party names "Whig" and "Tory"
were beginning to lose their meaning. By far the greater portion of the
House was thoroughly attached to the Hanoverian succession. Some fifty
Jacobites sat in it under the guidance of Shippen, and a certain number
of country gentlemen, with Wyndham at their head, still retained the
title of Hanoverian Tories. But the Parliamentary struggle lay in fact
between different sections of the Whigs, either of which, whatever their
pretensions may have been when out of office, would probably have acted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_969" id="Page_969">[969]</a></span>
much the same way had they succeeded in obtaining it. It was not till
the close of this reign and the beginning of the next that the old party
names began again to acquire significance. It had become evident that
the power and influence of the Crown, but little diminished, as has been
said, at the Revolution, had as it were been placed in commission in the
hands of the great leaders of the Whig party, who by means of their own
Parliamentary influence, added to the King's power which they wielded,
had assumed a monopoly of the Government antagonistic at once to the
Crown and to the people. Those who regarded this condition of things as a
disturbance of the old balance of the Constitution began to rally round
the King, and when George III. resumed into his own hands the power of
the Crown and broke with the Whig oligarchy, he found his support in this
new Tory party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of the Government.</div>

<p>To oppose the many able men whom enmity to the ministers had driven
into the ranks of the Patriots, the Government had little more than the
inert strength of an unfailing majority to show. Besides Walpole himself,
whose talents were unquestioned, the Government consisted of somewhat
second-rate men, such as Newcastle, whose fussy silliness was a constant
theme of jest, Stanhope, Lord Harrington, an excellent diplomatist but
no politician, and Lord Harvey, a clever but bitter and effeminate
courtier. But the Government was supported on almost every question of
importance by a vast majority of the House, whose votes the surpassing
skill of Walpole as a manager secured&mdash;many of them by small places
and pensions, or other "considerations," as bribes were then called.
That Walpole reduced the purchase of a majority, a practice by no means
unknown, to a system must be allowed. It may be urged in his favour, that
he used, but did not cause, the venality prevalent among all public men
of the time, and employed it so as to secure what was upon the whole the
government most advantageous for England at the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depression of the Jacobites.</div>

<p>The folly of the Pretender spared the minister all trouble with
regard to the Jacobites, for James had succeeded in alienating his
ablest partisans. He had quarrelled with Atterbury as he quarrelled with
Bolingbroke, he had excited scandal by his quarrel with his wife, and
had suffered an unworthy favourite, Colonel Hay, or Lord Inverness as he
called himself, to supplant all his better partisans in his favour. And
when the death of Lord Mar was followed by that of the Duke of Wharton
and of Atterbury in 1732, the Jacobite cause fell into the hands of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_970" id="Page_970">[970]</a></span>
inferior agents, whose intrigues, insignificant as they were, seem to
have been thoroughly known by Walpole.</p>

<p>It was thus with one source of danger practically removed that Walpole
resumed the threads of foreign policy. The last reign had
<span class="sidenote">European complications.</span> closed before peace
had been concluded with Spain, and while there were still unsettled
difficulties with the court of Vienna, although preliminaries had been
signed both in Paris and in Spain by what is known as the Convention of
the Pardo. It must indeed have been obvious that the Treaty of Vienna,
plausible as it seemed, could not have been a lasting treaty. The
Bourbons were upon the throne of Spain, and the close junction of the
houses of Bourbon and Hapsburg was an impossible contradiction of all
history, especially as the desire which was really the moving passion
of the Spanish court, the establishment, namely, of a Spanish kingdom
in Italy, was fundamentally opposed to the interests of Austria. At the
same time the shadow of the approaching dissolution of his kingdom at
his death was constantly overhanging the Emperor. No ideas of present
greatness, not even the hope of restoring the Empire to the position
it had held under Charles V., appeared in his eyes so important as to
secure the reversion of his own estates for his daughter, according to
the Pragmatic Sanction, by which, in 1713, he had arranged the succession
to his hereditary kingdoms. It was impossible for him to hurry into a
general war, which must of necessity prevent the acceptance of that
arrangement. There was already a strongly expressed feeling in Germany
against the marriages on which the Vienna Treaty rested, and which
might have the effect of placing a Spaniard on the Imperial throne. The
threatened secession of his chief allies, and the fear of postponing
the acceptance of the Pragmatic Sanction, were sufficient reasons to
induce the Emperor to withdraw from his bargain. He therefore accepted
the mediation of France, where Fleury, though he probably never forgot
the old policy of the country which he governed, always apparently
exhibited a love of peace; and it was agreed that disputed points should
be referred to a general Congress to be held at Aix-la-Chapelle, but
subsequently moved to Soissons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYNINE_CONGRESS_AT_SOISSONS" id="SEVENTEEN_TWENTYNINE_CONGRESS_AT_SOISSONS"></a>Congress at Soissons.</div>

<p>At the Congress the Emperor, afraid of exciting the national
prejudices of the Germans, entirely deserted his Spanish allies, and
instead of hastening a favourable negotiation, perpetually threw
obstacles in the way. As far as England was concerned, the great point at
issue was Gibraltar, which Spain had already besieged in vain. The ministry,
both before and now, seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_971" id="Page_971">[971]</a></span>
to have regarded the surrender of it as neither impossible nor very
injurious; the view of the nation was very different. But as is so
often the case, the Congress came to very little. Spain, finding herself
deserted by Austria, and observing that the Congress was falling
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Seville. Nov. 9, 1729.</span> to pieces
by constant delays, had recourse to a direct treaty; and on the 9th of
November 1729 the celebrated Treaty of Seville was signed. It was a
defensive alliance between England, Spain and France, to which Holland
subsequently acceded. Spain revoked all the privileges granted to
Austrian subjects by the treaties of Vienna, re-established English trade
in America on its former footing, and restored all captures. The Assiento
was confirmed to the South Sea Company, and arrangements made for
securing the succession of Parma and Tuscany to the Infant Don Carlos,
by substituting Spanish troops for the neutral forces, which since the
Preliminaries had been occupying those countries.</p>

<p>The Emperor now found that he had outwitted himself. He had
clung to the Treaty of Vienna just long enough to irritate two of the
<span class="sidenote">Disappointment of the Emperor.</span> great
countries of Europe, he had put difficulties in the way of its
completion, and hesitated about fulfilling it, just long enough to
irritate the third. Old friends and old foes had made common cause.
His hopes for the Pragmatic Sanction seemed entirely gone. It was not
likely that he would sit down quietly while Spanish troops occupied
fortresses in what he considered his dominions. He broke off all
diplomatic relations with Spain, sent troops into Italy, and on the
death of the Duke of Parma seized his duchy. But all men really knew
that the bribe was ready, if they would only give it, to put an end
to all his opposition. And the impatient Queen of Spain&mdash;angry
with the shilly-shally policy of her new allies (who would not insist
with sufficient rapidity on the completion of the Seville treaty),
throwing over France, which she regarded as the chief delinquent in the
matter&mdash;joined with England and Holland to offer the long wished for
guarantee. Thus at length by the second Treaty of Vienna all the much
vexed questions were decided. Austria was glad to accept the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYONE_SECOND_TREATY_OF_VIENNA" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYONE_SECOND_TREATY_OF_VIENNA"></a>Second Treaty of Vienna. March 16, 1731.</span>
terms proposed at Seville, agreed to destroy the Ostend Company, to
establish Don Carlos in his duchies, and not again to threaten the
balance of European power. And in 1732, under the escort of English
ships, the Spanish troops took possession of the disputed fortresses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complete supremacy of Walpole.</div>

<p>Both these treaties were arranged in accordance with the pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_972" id="Page_972">[972]</a></span>
views of Walpole. When the second was concluded he was absolute master of
affairs in England; for almost immediately after the Treaty of Seville
the old jealousy which had long smouldered between him and Townshend
burst out, and Townshend had found it necessary to withdraw. Townshend
was a proud, rough man, ill fitted to play the subordinate part which
Walpole was determined to thrust upon his colleagues. Besides general
ill-feeling, several specific grounds of difference existed between
them. The first Treaty of Vienna had greatly irritated Townshend, who
would have wished to avoid all compromise and to proceed to extremities
with the Emperor. The link which had bound the brothers-in-law together
had been broken by the death of Lady Townshend, Walpole's sister; and
Walpole's conduct with regard to the Pension Bill supplied a fresh ground
of quarrel. The Opposition had discovered, without exactly tracing it to
its constitutional <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTY_REJECTION_OF__THE_PENSION_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTY_REJECTION_OF__THE_PENSION_BILL"></a>The Pension Bill.</span>
source, the power of the royal influence, and early in 1730 Mr. Sandys
introduced the first of those Bills for restraining it which became
from this time onwards one of the regular weapons of attack against the
ministry. He moved for leave to bring in a Bill to disable all persons
from sitting in Parliament who had any pension direct or indirect from
the Crown, and proposed that every member as he took his seat should
swear that he held no such pension. The attack was exceedingly well
judged, for it gave expression to a very general feeling, and Walpole,
who studiously avoided shocking the feelings of any large section of the
nation, was at some loss how to meet it. But he knew that he could rely
upon his great Whig supporters in the Upper House, and of that House
Townshend was the leader. Walpole therefore suffered the Bill to pass
the Lower House without opposition, so that it was upon Townshend and
the Lords that the whole odium fell when, as a matter of course, they
rejected it. On these and various other grounds such ill blood sprang up
between the brothers, that it is told, though upon doubtful authority,
that they nearly came to blows at an entertainment in the house of Mrs.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYONE_RETIREMENT_OF_TOWNSHEND" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYONE_RETIREMENT_OF_TOWNSHEND"></a>Retirement of Townshend. 1731.</span>
Selwyn. It was impossible that both the ministers should remain in
office; the influence of the Queen turned the scale in favour of Walpole,
and Townshend resigned, withdrawing with unusual patriotism from
political life, and devoting himself at Reynham, his house in Norfolk,
to the improvement of agriculture. It is to him that we chiefly owe the
cultivation of turnips. This change, by allowing a proper rotation of crops, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_973" id="Page_973">[973]</a></span>
thus avoiding the necessity of leaving fields to lie fallow, added nearly
a third to the cultivable area of England, while by supplying large
quantities of cattle-food from a comparatively small space of ground, it
enormously increased the food-producing resources of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walpole's home government.</div>

<p>For two years the ascendancy of Walpole was unquestioned. He was
enabled to turn his thoughts to domestic improvements. English was
substituted, certainly most reasonably, for the ancient Law Latin in all
legal proceedings, to the grief it is said of some conservative lawyers,
and against the opposition of most of the judges. There was a Committee
of Inquiry also into the condition of public prisons, which brought many
revolting horrors to light. Both in the Fleet and Marshalsea torture
by thumbscrew and otherwise was constant, and the condition of poor
prisoners who could not bribe the gaolers was inconceivably horrid. Forty
or fifty of them, for instance, were locked up for the night in a cell
not sixteen feet square. Gaol-fever and famine were constantly destroying
them, so that the deaths at one prison were frequently eight or ten a
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYTHREE_HIS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYTHREE_HIS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES"></a>His financial measures. 1733.</div>

<p>But it was as a financier that Walpole was most favourably known,
and somewhat strangely it was a great financial reform in the year 1733
that almost brought him to ruin. Walpole was desirous of lessening even
the weak opposition by which he was confronted in Parliament; and in
the hope of attracting to himself the country gentlemen, he appealed,
in accordance with his usual principle, to their love of money, and
sought some way to lessen the Land Tax. For this purpose he suggested an
excise upon salt. This must have been contrary to his own convictions.
He could not have been ignorant how important an article salt is in
many manufactures, how necessary an article of purchase even among the
poorest. He was in fact taxing the poor and the manufacturing classes for
the sake of winning the landed interest, which would be called upon to
pay a land tax of one instead of two shillings. The new duty was carried,
but by no large majority. The chief argument against it was that it was
a step towards a general excise, which, because it seemed to infringe
on the rights of the subject by giving revenue officers the right of
entering houses, was much detested, and regarded as a badge of servitude.
Although the tax upon salt was not really intended as a beginning of a
general excise, it was nevertheless true that Walpole had a scheme of
that nature in his mind: for it was found after a year's experience that
the new tax upon salt fell short by two-thirds of the sum required to admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_974" id="Page_974">[974]</a></span>
of the reduction of the Land Tax to one shilling. It was to a new
measure of excise that Walpole looked to supply the deficiency. The
excisable articles at that time were malt, salt, and distilleries, and
the produce of the tax in 1733 was about £3,200,000. When Walpole's
project of extending the excise got wind it proved most repugnant to the
people. Numerous meetings were held, and many members were instructed to
vote against any such attempt. But when the project was brought before
the House, then in Committee, it appeared that Walpole, disowning all
intention of establishing a general excise, confined himself solely to
the duties on wine and tobacco; and even on those commodities designed
no increase of the present duties, but merely a change in the manner
of collecting them. In future the dues were to be collected after the
manner of an excise from the retailers, and not as heretofore in the
form of customs at the ports. Fraud and smuggling were so prevalent that
in tobacco alone the customs, which ought to have produced £750,000 a
year, produced in fact only £160,000. As these frauds took place chiefly
at the ports or along the seaboard, Walpole hoped by taxing the retail
trade, and not the importation, much to lessen them. In addition to
this, he would have established a system of warehousing without tax
for re-exportation, thus making London a free port. It was undoubtedly
an excellent plan. As he pointed out, it was the shops and warehouses
alone which were under supervision, not the houses of the retailers;
liberty was in no way infringed; it enabled him to remit the Land Tax
to the advantage of the country gentlemen; the scheme was advantageous
to the importer, who could re-export free of duty; the price of the
commodity was not raised. But none the less did it meet with the most
violent opposition. Wyndham likened it to the unjust imposts of Empson
and Dudley, and Pulteney derided it as a vast plan to cure an almost
imaginary evil. The people beset the doors of the House during the
debate in great crowds, irritating Walpole till he let fall the unhappy
words&mdash;"It may be said that they came hither as humble suppliants,
but I know whom the law calls sturdy beggars;" an expression which was
never forgiven. The resolution was carried, but by an unusually small
majority. On this and subsequent motions a Bill was founded, and in the
course of many discussions a new cry was raised by Pulteney, that, as
most of the seaport boroughs were already in the hands of one or the
other branch of the administration, this was a plan for bringing inland
towns under the same influences; and before the Bill came to a
second reading, the ministerial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_975" id="Page_975">[975]</a></span>
majority of sixty had dwindled to sixteen. The excitement became
dangerous; even the army was infected, and Walpole, according to his
usual principle, yielded to the violence of the storm and withdrew
the Bill. But though thus thwarted, he did not forego his revenge on
the defaulters of his own party. Chesterfield, the ablest man in the
ministry, Lord-Steward of the Household, was somewhat rudely dismissed.
Lord Clinton, the Earl of Burlington, the Duke of Montrose, the Earls of
Marchmont and Stair, and by a questionable exercise of prerogative the
Duke of Bolton and Lord Cobham, were deprived of their commission in the
army,&mdash;an arbitrary act not lost sight of by the Opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYFOUR_REFUSES_TO_JOIN_EUROPEAN_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYFOUR_REFUSES_TO_JOIN_EUROPEAN_WAR"></a>His pacific foreign policy.</div>

<p>As Walpole, true to his principles, had purchased peace at home
by concession, we find him the next year for the same object keeping
entirely aloof from a new war which had broken out in Europe. The Peaces
of Seville and Vienna had apparently completed the arrangements of
the Treaty of Utrecht, and settled all differences between the courts
of Spain and Vienna; but treaties based upon arbitrary territorial
arrangements for the purpose of preserving the balance of power are
always very liable to be broken. Neither <span class="sidenote">Fresh European war.</span>
party considers itself quite fairly treated, and is ever on the
look-out for some opening to regain its lost power or to acquire some
new influence. The Peace of Utrecht had closed the War of Succession,
undertaken solely to establish the balance of power in Europe, and had
been exactly such a treaty as has been described. The Peaces of Seville
and Vienna had been necessary to modify in some degree its arrangements.
A quarrel as to the election of a new King of Poland was sufficient to
render for the time all three of them useless. It will be remembered
that the French King had married the daughter of Stanislaus, ex-King of
Poland. All French influence therefore was now employed to secure his
re-election, while the Czarina Anne of Russia and the Emperor strongly
upheld the claims of Augustus, son of the late King. A Russian and a
Saxon army were sufficient to secure the throne for Augustus; but the
Emperor's interference, although indirect, had enabled Fleury to show
himself in his true colours, to listen to that great section of his
countrymen who were weary of the lengthened peace, and to bring on a war
which promised to be far more advantageous to France than any success
in Poland could have been. In his attack upon Austria he was joined at
once by Spain: for the Queen, the real ruler of the Peninsula, was still
discontented with the losses Spain had suffered by the late treaties,
and was besides very anxious to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_976" id="Page_976">[976]</a></span>
a crown for her son Don Carlos, who was already Duke of Parma. There was
a short campaign upon the Rhine, where Berwick commanded the French,
Eugene the Imperial army. Though the French lost their general before
Philipsburg, they were everywhere successful, and when the united armies
of Spain and Sardinia threw themselves on the kingdom of Naples, they
found no great difficulty in conquering the Austrians, and completing the
conquest of that country and of Sicily by the victory of Bitonto. Don
Carlos assumed the kingdom as Charles III.</p>

<p>Nothing could induce Walpole to side with either party in this war,
although he suffered much obloquy for refraining from it; and the
Emperor, unable to secure his assistance, allowed the pacific mediation
of France and England to have its weight. Preliminaries of peace were
set on foot (Oct. 1735), which ripened in three years into the great
treaty called the Definitive Peace of Vienna, by which the Spanish house
was allowed to retain Naples and Sicily. Sardinia was rewarded with some
frontier towns, among others Novara and Tortona, Lorraine was ceded to
France, and the young Duke of Lorraine, Francis, the affianced husband of
Maria Theresa (heiress to the Austrian Empire), was persuaded to accept
Tuscany in exchange. France and Sardinia again ratified the Pragmatic
Sanction. This somewhat trivial war thus completed the incorporation of
France, established the Bourbons in Naples, and was the cause of the
connection between Tuscany and the Austrian house.</p>

<p>Walpole had been more than usually anxious to keep clear of
European wars, because the time for the dissolution of
the Parliament under the Septennial Act was rapidly
approaching, and there seemed every reason to believe
that the struggle at the coming election would be a very fierce
one. The Opposition were already supplied with several very
effective cries. The Excise scheme, the arbitrary punishment of
his opponents, and his determination to keep up a standing army,
would all powerfully excite the people against the minister.
Before the dissolution they added one more cry against him by
making a strong attack upon the Septennial Act. As most of
the Opposition Whigs had voted for this Act, they had always
shrunk from demanding its repeal. It required all the skill of
Bolingbroke, the wire-puller of the Opposition, to induce the two
parties to unite in the assault. The debate is interesting, as showing
in a great speech of Wyndham the temper of the Opposition and the
sort of charges to which Walpole was exposed. "Let us suppose,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_977" id="Page_977">[977]</a></span>
said Wyndham, "a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honour,
of no great family, and of but a mean fortune, raised to
<span class="sidenote">Wyndham's speech against Walpole.</span>
be chief Minister of State by the concurrence of many whimsical events,
afraid or unwilling to trust any but creatures of his own making, and
most of them equally abandoned to all notions of virtue or honour, a
man ignorant of the true history of his country, and consulting nothing
but that of enriching and aggrandizing himself and his favourites;
in foreign affairs trusting none but those whose education makes it
impossible for them to have such knowledge or such qualifications as can
either be of service to their country or give weight or credit to their
negotiations. Let us suppose the true interest of the nation by such
means neglected or misunderstood, her honour and credit lost, her trade
insulted, her merchants plundered, her sailors murdered; and all these
things overlooked only for fear his administration should be endangered.
Suppose him next possessed of great wealth, the plunder of the nation,
with a Parliament of his own choosing, most of their seats purchased, and
their votes bought at the public expense. Let us suppose attempts made
to inquire into his conduct, and the reasonable request rejected by a
corrupt majority of his creatures.... Upon this scandalous victory let
us suppose this chief minister pluming himself in defiances, because he
finds he has a Parliament, like a packed jury, ready to acquit him at
all adventures. Let us suppose him arrived to that degree of insolence
as to domineer over all the men of ancient families, all the men of
sense, figure, or fortune in the nation, and as he has no virtue of his
own, ridiculing it in others, and endeavouring to destroy or corrupt it
in all.... Then let us suppose a prince, ignorant and unacquainted with
the inclinations and interests of his people.... Could there any greater
curse happen to a nation than such a prince on the throne, advised and
solely advised by such a minister, supported by such a Parliament?"
Walpole replied in a speech scarcely less vigorous, unveiling the secret
influence of Bolingbroke, attributing to him the whole management of
the Opposition, and pointing out his vast ambition and unequalled
faithlessness.</p>

<p>The election, after a severe struggle, ended by giving Walpole a large
majority, although considerably smaller than he had hitherto commanded.
The depression of the Opposition was great, especially as Bolingbroke,
weary of all exclusion from power, and involved in quarrels with
Pulteney, withdrew to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYFIVE_PRINCE_OF_WALES" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYFIVE_PRINCE_OF_WALES"></a>Prince of Wales head of the Opposition. 1735.</div>

<p>The leadership which Bolingbroke thus resigned fell in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_978" id="Page_978">[978]</a></span>
degree into the hands of the Prince of Wales, not indeed that he
possessed any of the talents of a leader, but that he formed a
rallying-point for all sections of the Opposition. From his first arrival
in England, in 1728, there had been the usual differences between him and
his father. He had thought himself ill-used in the matter of his intended
marriage with Wilhelmina of Prussia, whom, though he had never seen, he
pretended to adore. The mutual dislike of the fathers of the proposed
bride and bridegroom had broken off that match. He had since married a
sensible wife, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. But it was the parsimony of his
father which had principally excited his displeasure. He held his income
of £50,000 a year entirely at his father's will, whereas his father when
Prince of Wales had £100,000 secured to him. But parsimony was the ruling
passion of George II., and nothing could persuade him to increase his
son's income. Round the Prince had collected all the great leaders of the
Opposition; Pulteney, Chesterfield, Carteret, Wyndham and Cobham were
intimate with him, and Bolingbroke was his political instructor. Nor was
this all. Although the Queen had a love of literature, and in some ways
patronized clever men (especially in the matter of Church preferment),
Walpole had always refused to show them the least favour; and as a
natural consequence, all the better writers allied themselves closely
with the clever men of the Opposition, especially with Bolingbroke, who
had always been their friend. Swift, Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot, were
constantly writing vigorously against Walpole. "Gulliver's Travels" are
full of strokes of satire against the conduct of affairs. Some of Pope's
sharpest lines refer to the Queen's implacability towards her son. The
"Beggars' Opera" of Gay was regarded as being directed almost entirely
against the Government. The "Quarrels between Peacham and Lockit" were by
some thought to allude to the quarrel between Townshend and
Walpole;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in the Craftsman,
the organ of the Opposition, letters of the most virulent description
were constantly published against Walpole. To this brilliant Court
it was natural that the younger men rising to notoriety should ally
themselves. The intellect of the political world seemed there to be
centred, and the specious name of Patriot was apt to attract
enthusiastic youth. Pitt and Lyttelton began their political career
as members of this Opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_979" id="Page_979">[979]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not till the year 1737 that a public outbreak between the King
and Prince took place. In the preceding year an event had happened,
which, though of little historical importance, has been rendered
interesting by Sir Walter Scott in his "Heart of Midlothian." During
the King's absence in Hanover the Queen was left Regent. Two smugglers,
Wilson and Robertson, were imprisoned in the Tolbooth, and tried to
escape. Wilson went first, but being a big man, could not get through the
aperture they had made. Feeling that he had injured Robertson, on the
following Sunday in church he succeeded in grasping one of his guards
in each hand, and a third with his teeth, thus giving Robertson an
opportunity of escape, of which he availed himself. A strong sympathy was
excited for Wilson, and after his execution the soldiers were attacked
with stones. Porteous, who commanded the guard, fired upon the crowd.
For this he was tried and condemned to death, but, in consideration of
the provocation, was reprieved by Queen Caroline. The people, enraged at
this, organized a riot, and though notice was given to the magistrates,
no efficient means were taken for suppressing it. The gates were locked,
and the commander of the troops, frightened by Porteous' example, refused
to act. The Tolbooth was broken open, and Porteous hanged to a barber's
pole, all with the greatest order and regularity. Having done this, and
paid for the rope with which they hanged Porteous, the crowd dispersed,
nor could any of the rioters be detected. The Queen, regarding the
disturbance as a personal insult to her authority, was extremely angry.
It was proposed to abolish the Edinburgh city guard and the city charter,
level the gates, and declare the provost incapable of holding any office.
The opposition of the Scotch members and of the Scotch nobles was however
too great to be disregarded, and ultimately the city being fined £2000,
and the provost declared incapable of office, no further punishment was
inflicted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYSEVEN_QUARREL_OF_GEORGE" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYSEVEN_QUARREL_OF_GEORGE"></a>Quarrel of the King and Prince. 1737.</div>

<p>During this year the Prince of Wales had married. But this by no means
tended, as it was hoped, to the union of the Royal Family, for the Prince
at once renewed his demands for an increase of income. He determined
at length to follow Bolingbroke's advice, and demand that the sum he
received should not depend on the King's will, but be permanent and fixed
by the Parliament. This threat induced the King to make some overtures,
with a promise to give the Princess a jointure. They were rejected,
however, and the battle fought out. The great flaw in the organization of
the Opposition was then made manifest, for the Tories (forty-five in number)
refused to vote in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_980" id="Page_980">[980]</a></span>
favour of a Hanoverian prince, and the ministers were victorious.
This dispute was followed by a still more scandalous squabble,
the Prince hurried his wife from the King's residence at Hampton
Court to the empty palace of St. James's when she was on the
point of giving birth to her first child, who would be in the direct
line of succession to the throne. This insult was never forgiven,
and the King gave his son a peremptory order to leave the Court.
He withdrew at once to Norfolk House in St. James's Square,
<span class="sidenote">Death of the Queen.</span> which became the
centre of the Opposition. The Queen remained implacable, refusing to
see him even on her deathbed. Her death happened within a few weeks
of this unhappy quarrel, to the great loss of the King, whose want of
intellect she had chiefly supplied, of Walpole, whose staunch friend
she had always been, and indeed of all England, for by seconding Sir
Robert's views she had been mainly instrumental in securing for it that
period of comparative rest which was so much wanted to re-establish its
wellbeing after the troublous time of revolution it had passed through.
It was believed that Walpole's power had rested chiefly on her influence,
and there was a general expectation that her death would be followed by
his downfall. The Opposition were much disappointed when they found his
influence with the King as great as ever. It is <span class="sidenote">Walpole retains his influence with the King.</span>
said that with her parting words she had recommended the King to continue
to trust in her favourite minister; and her advice was then as always
followed by him. For though he was not a faithful husband, having had
Lady Suffolk for his mistress during the first years of his reign,
and now allying himself with Sophia de Walmoden, created Countess of
Yarmouth, his mistresses never had any great political influence over
him&mdash;no influence at all events comparable to that exercised by the
Queen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYEIGHT_THE_OPPOSITION_ATTACKS" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYEIGHT_THE_OPPOSITION_ATTACKS"></a>The Opposition attacks his pacific policy.</div>

<p>The Opposition, though disappointed, by no means relaxed its efforts,
and found a favourable point of attack in Walpole's pacific tendencies.
There were still several points of dispute unsettled with Spain. The
limits between Georgia and Florida were undetermined. By the Treaty of
Seville trade was established on its former footing between the two
countries, and the commercial relations between them were therefore
regulated by the somewhat indefinite treaties of 1667 and 1670. By these
the right of search and the right of seizure of contraband goods was
allowed to the respective nations. This right was exercised with varying
severity by the Spaniards according to their relation with England
at the time. But the trade of English America had very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_981" id="Page_981">[981]</a></span>
increased, and would not be restrained from seeking legally or illegally
the trade of South America. There was no doubt abundant smuggling.
Even the South Sea Company, which was allowed to send one ship a year,
contrived in fact much to increase that number by sending tenders with
her, which secretly replenished her cargo as she parted with it. On the
other hand, it is equally certain that the Spanish Guarda-Costas had
exercised their authority roughly, and many tales of the ill-usage of
British subjects were current. These stories were collected and brought
up in Parliament by the Opposition, the best known being that of Jenkin's
ear. Jenkin was a captain, who asserted that his ear had been torn from
him, and that he had been bidden to take it to his king. "Then," said
he, "I recommended my soul to God and my cause to my country." The
<span class="sidenote">George desires war.</span> ear, wrapped in cotton,
he was in the habit of showing to his listeners. This claptrap story was
most effective in rousing the popular indignation. Walpole resisted the
clamour, but met with great difficulties. The King, who was at heart a
soldier, now freed from the peaceful influence of his wife, was urgent
for war; and in the Cabinet itself Newcastle began to bid for increased
power by favouring this desire of the King.</p>

<p>In this eagerness for war, which is frequently represented as a
folly on the part of the nation, the people were probably really wiser
than their rulers. The state of Europe was becoming such that war was
necessary for England, if she was to uphold her position, and to obtain
that paramount situation in commerce and on the sea which her people
then as now regarded as her due. Walpole's peace policy was certainly
directed rather to the aggrandizement of his party than to the general
interest of the nation, and in pursuit of it he had allowed himself to be
duped by the pacific language of Cardinal Fleury. His attention had been
distracted from the broader lines of European politics to the details of
the constantly shifting diplomacy of the time. It is now known that, as
early as 1733, the Family Compact had been entered into between the two
branches of the House of Bourbon, for the express purpose of hampering
the trade of England, and with a stipulation for mutual assistance both
in war-ships and privateers in case of any encroachment on the part of
England. Nor was the agreement a dead letter. M. de Maurepas had been
busily and successfully employed in reorganizing the French navy.</p>

<p>Walpole attempted at first to pursue his established policy of peace.
He opened negotiations with Spain, supported by such signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_982" id="Page_982">[982]</a></span>
coming hostilities as induced that Court to agree to a convention.
Many English prisoners and some English prizes were restored, and
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYNINE_NEGOTIATIONS_WITH_SPAIN" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTYNINE_NEGOTIATIONS_WITH_SPAIN"></a>Negotiations with Spain. 1739.</span>
compensation was promised to the amount of £200,000. Against this,
however, was set £60,000 to be paid by England for the destruction
of Spanish ships by Admiral Byng in 1718, and in his eagerness for
prompt payment Walpole suffered it to be further reduced to £95,000.
The disputed points were left for further negotiation. No mention was
made of the right of search; the limits of Georgia were not defined.
When this convention became known the popular indignation was great.
It was regarded as a resignation of our rights. The ridiculously small
sum given for compensation was pointed out, and the payment of £60,000
for what the people regarded as a glorious victory was naturally much
resented. It was in opposing this convention that Pitt seems first to
have shown his great powers of oratory. The ministerial majority was
only twenty-eight. Believing that they could now safely proceed to
extremities, the Opposition determined upon seceding from the House.
With the arguments all on one side, and the votes upon the other, it was
impossible, they said, for them to continue to do their duty there. It
was a foolish man&oelig;uvre, which, though tried more than once, has never
been successful. To the public it invariably appears factious, and as no
Opposition has been found determined enough to keep it up for any length
of time, it has always been made ridiculous by the speedy return of the
seceders. In the present instance Walpole sarcastically thanked the
Opposition for their withdrawal, and proceeded at once to pass several
measures which would otherwise have been sharply opposed; among others, a
subsidy to Denmark for a palpably Hanoverian object&mdash;the security,
namely, of the little castle of Steinhorst in Holstein.</p>

<p>But though he had carried his convention, and although the
Opposition had withdrawn, and Cardinal Fleury had offered the
mediation of France, it became obvious to Walpole that he must
either declare war or resign. His love of power prevented
<span class="sidenote">Walpole declares war rather than resign.</span>
him from taking the latter and more honourable course, and, to the
loss of both power and fame, he suffered himself to be dragged against
his convictions into war, which was declared on the 19th of October.
The joy of England was very great, although Walpole was full of gloomy
forebodings, for, as he himself said, "no man can prudently give his
advice for declaring war without knowing the whole system of the affairs
of Europe as they stand at present.... It is not the power of Spain and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_983" id="Page_983">[983]</a></span>
power of this nation only that we ought in such a case to know and to
compare. We ought also to know what allies our enemies may have, and what
assistance we may expect from our friends." He felt certain that the area
of the war would soon be extended, for, although he had successfully used
his efforts to maintain friendship with France, he knew that there was an
intimate connection between France and Spain which must sooner or later
bring the former into the field. Moreover, his information as to the
plans of the Jacobites was exceedingly accurate, and while the Opposition
were constantly deriding the notion of any formidable organization of
that party, he never ceased to be on his guard against it. The justice of
his views was at once shown, when the declaration of war called to life
the slumbering energy of the Jacobites. Intrigues were immediately set
on foot; a Committee was appointed in England; overtures were addressed
to Spain; and, as Fleury gradually grew colder and more estranged from
England, proposals were made to him also, to which he listened, and
promised that he would send a body of troops, probably the Irish Brigade,
to support any attempt in favour of the Stuarts; thus would be fulfilled
the condition without which the English Jacobites had always refused to
rise. It was hoped that the Duke of Ormond and the Earl Marischal might
make a simultaneous expedition from Spain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Walpole, having once yielded, seemed conscious that he no
longer possessed the absolute dominion over Parliament he had so long
enjoyed. Wyndham, his chief enemy, indeed had died: but in the ranks
of the Opposition were still to be found all those men of ability whom
twenty years of exclusive and jealous power had made his enemies; and
to his old foes was now added the exciting eloquence and uncompromising
energy of Pitt. To oppose this formidable body Walpole stood almost
alone in the Commons, supported only by such men as Henry Pelham, a
conscientious and sensible but not first-rate man, Wilmington, and Sir
William Young, whose ready ability scarcely atoned for his damaged
character. In the House of Lords he still counted the Duke of Newcastle,
Lord Hervey, and Lord Hardwicke among his party. But Hardwicke and
Newcastle were both opposed to his peaceful views, and the latter was
already intriguing against his chief. The Duke of Argyle had lately
become hostile to the ministry, and had been deprived of all his
employments. Walpole thus became the single object of all the Opposition
invectives. Every measure for the last twenty years which had either failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_984" id="Page_984">[984]</a></span>
or been unpopular was brought against him. The quarrel had become personal
between him and the Opposition. His efforts to retain his power were
unceasing. He yielded in the Cabinet as to the manner in which the war
was to be carried on; he gave the chief command of the expedition in the
West Indies to his political enemy Vernon; to secure the Jacobite votes
at the next election he even went so far as to enter into correspondence
with the Pretender, although probably without serious intentions. But
this conduct did but encourage his enemies, and in the last session of
Parliament (1741) Mr. Sandys brought forward a motion, which was repeated
in the Upper House, for his removal from the King's councils. Walpole so
far rebutted the charges brought against him, that, after a defence of
great eloquence, he succeeded in throwing out the motion by a very large
majority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ill success of the war.</div>

<p>Walpole's forebodings were speedily fulfilled. Not only, as we
have seen, was the Jacobite party at once again called to life, but
his expeditions against Spain were by no means great successes. Anson
indeed, although all his other ships were lost, made several successful
attacks upon treasure-ships, captured Paita, and succeeded in bringing
'The Centurion' safe home after a circumnavigation of the globe. But
Vernon, though successful in taking Porto Bello (when his conduct was
vociferously contrasted by the Opposition with that of Hozier in 1726),<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
was repulsed with heavy loss in an assault on Carthagena. France had
become thoroughly hostile, and when, on the 20th of October 1740, the
Emperor Charles VI. died, it became evident that the war would shortly
become European. In spite, however, of these proofs of Walpole's
foresight, in spite of his success against Mr. Sandys' motion, the
charges which had been brought against him had such an effect at the
next election that the Opposition found themselves with much increased
strength, and it became pretty plain that the Government would have but a
very small majority. The session opened with a series of close
divisions. The Opposition succeeded in carrying their Chairman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_985" id="Page_985">[985]</a></span>
Committees against the Government candidate, and when he found
<span class="sidenote">Walpole resigns. 1742.</span> himself at last
defeated on the Chippenham election petition, Walpole took the resolution
of resigning. A few days later he gave up all his places, and was made
Lord Orford.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYTWO_WALPOLE_RESIGNS" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYTWO_WALPOLE_RESIGNS"></a>Review of Walpole's ministry.</div>

<p>Thus closed the career of the statesman who for twenty years had
been the sole guide of English politics. It is remarkable how few great
measures can be traced to him; but he probably displayed true wisdom in
allowing all reforms, however much they may have been required, to remain
for a time in abeyance. The one thing which England required was rest.
The last hundred years had been one continual scene of political turmoil.
During the whole of that period the Revolution had been slowly working
itself out, and the English Constitution had been changing. The power had
gradually shifted from the King to the House of Commons. The ministry
had ceased to be a body of secretaries, to whom was indeed intrusted
the chief management of all national affairs, but who, inasmuch as they
were still in theory, and in a great degree in practice, merely called
upon to execute the King's commands, might be chosen indiscriminately
from all parties. Instead of this it had become, what it has practically
ever since been, a Committee of the majority in the House of Commons.
In a social point of view, during much of the same period, England had
been perplexed by a choice of masters, and in some degree by a choice of
religions. Walpole seems thoroughly to have understood this position, and
to have set himself steadily to work to complete and give stability to
the changes which had been going on. He had seen, that far more important
than any further improvements to the Constitution was the establishment
on a firm footing of what had already been done. His chief object was
therefore to make himself absolute master of the House of Commons. For
this purpose he used means which we should now consider disgraceful. He
is reported to have acted on the principle that every man had his price.
He steadily opposed all efforts for the exclusion of pensioners, not
from a wish to increase the power of the Crown, but because he wanted
to secure the power of the minister, who he saw must henceforward be
the real governor of England. He opposed the Peerage Bill because it
threatened to increase the power of the Lords as against the Commons.
He persistently refused all attempts at coalition (such as had been
contemplated by Stanhope and subsequently proposed by Bolingbroke),
because he wanted the ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_986" id="Page_986">[986]</a></span>
to be the representatives of the party which had the majority in the
House, and of that party only. He kept a tight hand throughout his
administration upon the Jacobites, conscious that the security of the
reigning house was the only way of calming the uneasiness which all
classes felt while they had any choice of rulers offered them. For
similar reasons, with regard to religion, he refused to listen to any
propositions for the relief of Roman Catholics, which Stanhope had
also contemplated; and still further to calm religious discords by the
sense of one strong paramount Church of England, he also refused all
concessions to the Dissenters, although they systematically supported
him. In saying, however, that the power had passed to the House of
Commons, we must be careful not to regard the House of Commons as a
popular assembly. The next phase of our history, the complement to that
part of the Revolution which we have now passed, is the struggle of the
people to get possession of their own House. At the time of which we
are speaking the House of Commons was so filled with nominees of great
lords, the electoral body was so limited, and the distribution of seats
so arbitrary, that the House of Commons could in no way be regarded
as a fair representation of the people, and the great Whig majority
rested not on the liberal feeling of the nation, but upon an oligarchy
of great Whig nobles. In his foreign policy Walpole was influenced by
similar principles. Though the Peace of Utrecht was a Tory peace, its
maintenance, and that of the balance of power it had established, was his
chief object. Anything was better than that England should be engaged in
war. War at once opened the door for Jacobite hopes. War at once touched
that material prosperity which was to be the surest claim of gratitude
to the reigning house. Moreover, as a financier, Walpole hated war. It
was in this capacity, if we set aside his general ability and skill in
management, that Walpole was greatest. We have seen how prudently he
re-established credit after the bursting of the South Sea bubble, and how
wise was his plan in his ill-fated Excise Bill. If some of his measures
(as the Salt Tax) were dictated by political rather than economical
necessities, it is yet certain that he inspired universal confidence,
and owed much of his power to the support of the moneyed interest. His
personal character, like that of most of his contemporaries, was not
good. A large, coarse-looking person did not belie the coarseness of his
tastes. He drank freely, joked coarsely, and had more than one natural
child. Although in one of his speeches he plumes himself on having
never been charged with corruption, his private fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_987" id="Page_987">[987]</a></span>
was certainly much increased by his ministry, and if we except his
collection of pictures at Houghton, there is no sign that he had any
appreciation of literature or of the arts. His ignorance of literature,
and his contempt for it, is indeed notorious. He spent vast sums of money
in purchasing the services of pamphleteers; scarcely one of them was
worth anything. He seems to have regarded writing like any other trade,
as being capable of being purchased by the piece. Patronage to literary
men he systematically refused; we therefore find all the able writers of
the time ranged on the side of the Opposition; and it is for the same
reason perhaps that the worst points of his character are those which are
more commonly known.</p>

<p>The chief fault of Walpole had been his jealousy of talent; on his
fall there was no one in the ministry of sufficient influence to take
up the reins which had fallen from his hands. Had there been any
<span class="sidenote">The new ministry under Wilmington.</span>
great difference of principle between him and the Opposition, a complete
change of ministry would naturally have resulted. But both the Government
and the Opposition had been in the main Whigs. Any man of commanding
intellect might have kept the late ministry together. As it was, a sort
of coalition was made. Pulteney, it is difficult to say why, avoided the
responsibility of the Premiership, and withdrew into insignificance in
the Upper House as Lord Bath. The nominal head of the new Government was
Wilmington, that same dull man who had for a moment thought to supersede
Walpole at the beginning of the reign. Under him many of the old Cabinet
were retained; Newcastle, Hardwicke, and Young keeping their offices. The
new element was represented by Argyle, who was reinstated as Master of
the Ordnance, Carteret, who succeeded Lord Harrington as Secretary, and
Sandys, who became Chancellor of the Exchequer. Of Tories there appeared
none, and Chesterfield and Pitt were excluded from the arrangement.</p>

<p>So slight a change in the construction of the Government seemed
but a poor termination to the fierce opposition to which Walpole
had been subjected. In fact, the rivalry had been one of persons
<span class="sidenote">Character of the new ministry.</span> and not of
principles. The ministry were compelled indeed, by pressure from without
excited by their own clamours, to institute a Committee to inquire
into the conduct of the great Prime Minister. But though it consisted
principally of his personal enemies, too many interests were at stake to
render their task easy; and when their report came, it appeared
so trumpery, when compared with the charges which had been lavished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_988" id="Page_988">[988]</a></span>
upon the minister in Parliament, that it was a mere object of ridicule.
It seemed as though the system of Walpole was after all to be continued.
Many of his followers still remained in the Cabinet, as the Pelhams
(Newcastle and his brother Henry Pelham), and Yorke, Lord Hardwicke,
and even the virtual Prime Minister, his enemy Carteret, was obliged
by stress of circumstances to adopt that very Hanoverian policy which
had so often been laid to the charge of the late minister. Carteret was
a man of genius, but of irregular life, and so capricious, and sudden
in his actions, that his administration has been called the drunken
administration. Disregarding home patronage for the higher and more
exciting work of foreign diplomacy, he found his influence gradually and
surely passing into the hands of the Pelhams. It was necessary for him at
all hazards to secure the King's friendship; he therefore allowed 16,000
Hanoverians to be taken into English pay, and it was strange to hear
Lord Bath, and Sandys, the accuser of Walpole, upholding the Hanoverian
connection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYTHREE_PHELHAM_SUCCEES_WILMINGTON" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYTHREE_PHELHAM_SUCCEES_WILMINGTON"></a>Pelham succeeds Wilmington. 1743.</div>

<p>A ministry which showed itself thus inconsistent with its assertions
when out of office, and in which the elements of disunion were so
evident, could not last long. The death of Wilmington (1743), the nominal
Prime Minister, was the signal for its dissolution. The candidates for
the Premiership were Pulteney on the one hand, supported by the talents
of Carteret, and by the favour which this minister's newly-found interest
for Hanover had given him with the King; and on the other hand Pelham, as
representative of the party of Walpole, and backed by the influence which
he still possessed. The question was settled in favour of Pelham, who,
though without commanding abilities and constitutionally timid, possessed
much of his late leader's love of quiet and power of management. Carteret
continued for some time in power under his new chief; but their union
could never be cordial, and before the close of 1744, Carteret&mdash;who
had by continual flattery of the King's weakness so ingratiated himself
with his master that the Pelhams thought their legitimate influence
damaged by it&mdash;was dismissed. But before the confusion which arose
on Walpole's fall had settled down one great point in his policy had at
all events been reversed&mdash;England had thrown itself vigorously into
the Continental war.</p>

<p>Such indeed was the position of Europe that it was impossible
that England should hold aloof. But Walpole had at least
tried, and with some effect, the power of diplomacy. The death
of the Emperor Charles VI. of Germany had opened two great
questions for which Europe had been long preparing. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_989" id="Page_989">[989]</a></span>
these was the succession to the Austrian dominions, which Charles
<span class="sidenote">Question of the Austrian succession.</span>
had attempted to secure for his daughter by means of the Pragmatic
Sanction, and the other was the succession to the Empire. The questions
were closely connected. The most dangerous claimant for the succession
to the Austrian dominions was the Elector of Bavaria, who alone of the
powers of Europe had refused the acceptance of the Pragmatic Sanction;
he was also the most influential candidate for the Imperial dignity. The
Elector rested his claim to the Austrian succession upon an arrangement
by which, as long ago as the middle of the sixteenth century, Ferdinand
I. was said to have substituted the heir of his daughter Anne, from whom
the Elector was descended, in the place of any other female heir. A
second claimant was the King of Spain, who regarded himself as the heir
of all the rights of a descendant of Charles V., who, when he divided
his empire with his brother, reserved the right of succession to his
own immediate posterity should the direct male line of Ferdinand become
extinct. Both Bavaria and Spain were close allies of France, and the
possession of the Empire by the Elector, or of the Austrian dominions
either by the Elector or the Spanish King, would render the influence
of France paramount in Europe. It was necessary for England to oppose
such an increase of the power of the Bourbons. For this purpose it had
appeared necessary to Walpole to re-establish something resembling the
Grand Alliance, a union at all events which should include the maritime
powers, Hanover, Prussia (rapidly rising to a first-rate power), and
Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambition of Prussia.</div>

<p>But Prussia had just fallen into the hands of the ambitious Frederick
II., supplied by his father's care with a magnificent army and with a
full treasury. He saw that the opportunity had arrived for making good
certain long pending claims upon a portion of Silesia, and without
declaration of war, occupied the disputed territory, and marching into
Bohemia, entirely defeated the Austrian troops at Molwitz. He was however
yet so far German at heart, that he was willing to guarantee the election
of Maria Theresa's husband to the Empire, and to support the Pragmatic
Sanction, if his claims in Silesia were satisfied. To induce the Austrian
princess to accept these terms became the object of English diplomacy.
It was thwarted by Maria Theresa herself. A strange infatuation had
taken possession of the Austrian ministers during the close of the late
Emperor's reign; in spite of his action in the Polish war, they
believed in the pacific tendencies of Fleury, and relied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_990" id="Page_990">[990]</a></span>
upon the friendship of France. All overtures on the part of Frederick
were therefore disregarded, all appeals from England set at naught. The
foolish dreams of Austria were dispelled when Frederick, thus repulsed,
threw away his last remnant of German feeling and entered into close
alliance with France, offering to renounce the claims which he had upon
the Duchy of Berg, and to give his vote for the election of the Bavarian
Elector to the Empire if his claims on Silesia were guaranteed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Maria Theresa.</div>

<p>Thus Maria Theresa found herself standing alone in Europe, supported
by England only, which indeed supplied her willingly with subsidies,
but still directed its chief efforts to persuading her to purchase
Frederick's friendship by the cession of Silesia. In accordance with the
convention with Prussia, in August 1741, two French armies were poured
across the Rhine, one passing through Swabia to assist the Elector in
a direct advance on Vienna, the second through Westphalia. So little
was England prepared for war, that the King, as Elector of Hanover, was
obliged to declare the neutrality of his Continental dominions for a
year, a step which excited great anger in England, where the war spirit
ran high, and which was a fresh source of complaint against Walpole. At
this crisis of her danger Maria Theresa found assistance in that part of
her dominions where she had least right to expect it. The hand of the
Hapsburgs had been heavy upon Hungary, yet thither she betook herself,
and yielding back to them almost the whole of their constitution, excited
the warlike magnates to enthusiasm by confiding to their charge her
person and that of her child. As they crowded round to kiss the infant's
hand, the hall rang with the shouts, "We will die for our king, Maria
Theresa!" A moment's breathing space would allow time to bring the levée
en masse of Hungary into the field: the opportunity was afforded by the
diplomacy of England, which induced Frederick, who saw with jealousy the
advancing power of France and Germany, to check his victorious march
and sign a secret treaty at Kleinschnellendorf. The gathering forces
of Hungary, the withdrawal of Frederick, and the errors of the Elector
and of the French, who were jealous of each other, changed the face of
the war. The march to Vienna was postponed for the capture of Prague.
The withdrawal of the invaders to Bohemia allowed the Austrians to make
a counter blow. As the Elector Charles Albert hastened to Frankfort to
secure his election as Emperor, Khevenhüller, with the Austrian troops,
was approaching his capital of Munich. Again, at the earnest
entreaties of France, Frederick deserted his late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_991" id="Page_991">[991]</a></span>
engagements and renewed the war, but, unable to hold his advanced
position at Olmutz in Moravia, he too fell back upon Bohemia,
where the war was now centred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England supports Austria.</div>

<p>The changed aspect of affairs was completed by the conduct of
England: the pride of the country had been touched by Vernon's failure
at Carthagena; the neutrality of Hanover had caused great discontent;
and when, in February 1742, Walpole had been driven from the ministry,
the first act of his successors had been to increase both army and navy,
to vote large subsidies to Maria Theresa, to induce the States-General
to follow the lead of England, and to send an army of 30,000 English and
Hanoverians into the Low Countries. It was understood that, although as
yet but auxiliaries in the main quarrel, it was the rivalry of France
and England which was again to be decided in arms. Both the arms and
diplomacy of England were successful. In the Mediterranean the fleet
under Commodore Matthews forced King Charles of Naples to neutrality,
and allowed Sardinia, driven by the ambition of Spain to side with
Austria, to defeat all the projects of the Bourbons in that country;
while the urgent instances of the ambassador at Vienna at length
prevailed, and Maria Theresa was induced to give the price which Prussia
demanded,&mdash;Silesia was conceded by the Treaties of Breslau and
Berlin in June 1742. Frederick once more threw over his allies, and the
French and Bavarians stood alone in Germany. They were unable to make
head against their enemies, their troops were shut up in Prague, and
only after a brilliant but disastrous retreat did a shattered remnant of
14,000 men reach a place of safety in January 1743.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Battle of Dettingen. June 27th 1743.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The English army in Flanders.</div>

<p>The tide of victory was then already turned when the English made
their first appearance in Europe, acting in conjunction with some 18,000
subsidized Hanoverians. The command of the English army, which to the
number of 16,000 had been all the last year lying inactive in Flanders,
was given to Lord Stair, and the object of the allies was to drive
the French entirely out of Germany, and if possible invade Alsace and
Lorraine, on which the eyes of the Austrians, who had but lately lost
them, were constantly fixed. To oppose the movement an army under the
Duke de Noailles entered Franconia, and the various divisions of the
British army and their allies from Hanover were set in motion towards
the Maine. With characteristic slowness, Stair proceeded to collect upon
the Maine an army of 40,000 men. Towards the Maine also on the south De
Noailles betook himself with about 60,000. Stair lay idly awaiting his
12,000 Hanoverians and Hessians who had not yet appeared, and thus gave
De Noailles opportunity of securing the south of the river and holding
most of the passages across it. Having waited long enough to be thus
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Dettingen.</span> outgeneralled, Stair
suddenly changed his plan, and, without receiving his reinforcements,
marched up the river towards Franconia. He passed Hanau, where he
established his chief magazines, and moved towards Aschaffenberg. Between
these two towns branches of the Spessart mountains approach the Maine,
and about half way between the two is the large village of Dettingen.
From Dettingen to Aschaffenberg extends a narrow plain, entered by a
somewhat difficult passage between the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_993" id="Page_993">[993]</a></span>
and river at Dettingen. On reaching this plain the English found
themselves outmarched by De Noailles, and thus cut off from
Aschaffenberg. It was while thus entangled that they were joined by the
King and the Duke of Cumberland. The King found the army cut off from
the supplies it had hoped to draw from Franconia, and in danger of being
separated from its magazines at Hanau also. Thither it was determined
if possible to secure a retreat. As the English believed that the enemy
was higher up the river than they were, and that they should be closely
pursued, the King took command of the rear as the post of danger, but
De Noailles had already forestalled them. He had at once moved down the
river so as to put himself between the English and Hanau, taking up his
position at Seligenstadt. He sent some 23,000 men, under his nephew the
Duc de Grammont, across the river to occupy Dettingen. These troops
occupied a very strong position behind a swamp and a ravine made by a
watercourse. De Noailles' main army lay on the southern bank, but bridges
of communication were made between the two divisions, and cannon placed
on the south bank to play upon the flank of the retreating English.
Escape seemed almost impossible, especially as the English were in
entire ignorance of these movements. On finding his advance checked at
Dettingen, George at once left the rear and put himself at the head of
the army. There seemed no course but to cut a way through De Grammont's
forces. This commander, however, believing himself engaged with the
advanced troops of the English army only, and thinking to crush them,
rashly left his strong position and crossed the ravine. He found himself
in front of the whole English army. The King's horse had run away with
him, and he had dismounted and put himself at the head of his troops, and
addressing them a few inspiriting words, led them to the attack with much
gallantry. De Noailles saw the destruction of his plans and hastened to
retrieve the error of his nephew. His efforts however were useless. The
mass of infantry, led by his Majesty in person, broke through the enemy,
whose loss was so great that De Noailles recalled them beyond the Maine.
The retreat towards the bridges became a rout, and they left more than
6000 dead and wounded upon the field. The King wisely determined to get
out of his dangerous position as soon as possible, and pushed on that
night to Hanau, leaving his wounded to the mercy of the French commander,
who treated them exceedingly well. Stair, as hasty in the moment of
victory as slow in his preliminary movements, urged immediate pursuit,
but was overruled by the King. On receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_994" id="Page_994">[994]</a></span>
expected reinforcements he again urged advance, but jealousies had
sprung up between him and the German commanders. He was disgusted at the
rejection of his advice, and talking loudly of Hanoverian influence, sent
in his resignation, which was accepted.</p>

<p>The objects of a further advance however were obtained without
bloodshed. The French army in Bavaria had been beaten backwards

into Alsace, whither De Noailles, finding himself unsupported between
two enemies, also withdrew. The victorious allies pushed on after them,
the King to Worms and Prince Charles to beyond the Rhine opposite Alt
Brisach. The new Emperor was thus left without allies, and concluded
(July 1743) a convention of neutrality with the Austrians, and withdrew
to Philipsburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations for peace. July.</div>

<p>A favourable opportunity for peaceful arrangements seemed to have
arrived. Prussia had gained its object; French intervention had failed;
the Austrian succession was secured; the only open question was what
was to be done with the expelled Emperor. George and his favourite
minister Carteret, who were at Hanover, undertook the negotiations.
George, as Elector of Hanover, and Carteret, from his general interest
in foreign politics, took a German and not an English view of the
situation. It was George's object, as Elector of Hanover, to appear
as a paramount power among the other electors, and to form a strong
alliance in the Empire entirely in his own interests. For this purpose
he had naturally,&mdash;considering the antecedents of his second
kingdom England, regarded a close alliance with Austria as of the utmost
importance. At the same time, as a Prince of the Empire, he had no strong
wish that the Imperial dignity should be constantly in Austrian hands,
and was quite willing to allow the validity of the election of the
Emperor Charles. In conjunction with Carteret, he therefore agreed that
Charles should retain the Imperial title upon condition of renouncing
all claims on Austria, of allowing the validity of the vote of Bohemia
in all affairs of the Empire, and of dismissing the French from the
fortified places they still held within the Empire. He even consented to
insist upon the restoration by Austria of Charles's hereditary dominions,
Bavaria (now to be erected into a kingdom), and upon the payment of a
large sum to the Emperor to support his dignity. Had this treaty been
completed, George would have appeared as the mediator of the peace of the
Empire, as the champion of the rights of the princes, as the defender
of the Austrian dominions, and altogether as the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_995" id="Page_995">[995]</a></span>
power in Germany. To a certain point the interests of the people of
England had been the same as that of their King. But their real enmity
was against France, and under the guidance of a Whig aristocracy, they
would have wished to pursue their traditional policy of opposing the
Bourbons chiefly at sea. The arrangements of the proposed treaty by no
means suited them. They had long been clamouring against the German
tendencies of the King, they had seen with extreme dislike the employment
of subsidized Hanoverian troops, and now positively refused to pay a
subsidy to the Emperor&mdash;a Bavarian prince and the hereditary friend
of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty of Worms. Sept. 13, 1743.</div>

<p>To the astonishment of the negotiating Powers and the shame of
Carteret, the proposed treaty was suddenly broken off. England wanted
war with France, and considered it could be best carried on by close
alliance with Austria, which was only too glad to continue the war, with
the hope of retaining its hold on Bavaria and rewinning Silesia. A treaty
known as the Treaty of Worms therefore took the place of the former
pacific arrangements. England, Holland, Austria, Saxony, and Sardinia,
agreed to assure the Pragmatic Sanction and the European balance, while
Sardinia undertook the armed defence of the Austrian dominions in Italy.
It was met by a counter treaty known as the League of Frankfort, the most
important members of <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFOUR_LEAGUE_OF_FRANKFORT" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFOUR_LEAGUE_OF_FRANKFORT"></a>League of Frankfort. April 5, 1744.</span>
which were France and Prussia; for the elevation of Hanover implied the
degradation of Prussia, and the promise of the King of Sardinia set
free Austrian troops which the Prussian King believed would be used
only for the purpose of reconquering Silesia. The European contest was
thus assuming a more general and intelligible form; England and France,
hitherto auxiliaries, appeared each at the head of a great league, and it
was their interests, and indirectly the supremacy of the sea, which were
now at issue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Threatened invasion of England.</div>

<p>Even yet no declaration of war between England and France had
been issued, but it was natural that the French, aware of the real
character of the war, should use every means for distressing England.
Early in the year it set on foot an attempted invasion of England in
favour of the Stuarts. An army of 15,000 was collected at Dunkirk, and
placed under the command of the best French general, Marshal Saxe, while
fleets were collected at Toulon and Brest for the invasion of England and
to support a Jacobite rising. The Brest fleet came out of harbour and
approached the English coast. The English fleet was drawn into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_996" id="Page_996">[996]</a></span>
pursuit; and for the moment the coast of Kent was unguarded. A
considerable portion of the French army was on board the transports and
had sailed. Once again England owed its safety to the weather. A violent
storm blowing direct upon Dunkirk, prevented the movement of the rest of
the transports, scattered those already at sea, and the loss was such
that the French ministry abandoned their design, and Marshal Saxe was
appointed to command the army in Flanders. The naval armaments and this
open support of the Pretender gave rise to warm complaints of breach of
treaty on the part of our envoy at Paris; as his complaints were listened
to with disdain, a formal declaration of war was at length made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the war.</div>

<p>On the Continent the selfish policy of the French, who could
think of nothing but the extension of their own boundaries, ruined
the success of the war. The Netherlands were invaded
and rapidly overrun; Savoy and Piedmont conquered;
but these successes on the extremity of the scene of action did not tend
to the conclusion of the war. Frederick of Prussia advanced through
Bohemia and took Prague, and thus saved France from a threatened
invasion of Alsace; but, unsupported by his allies, he fell back from
the Austrian dominions, and upon the death of the Emperor (Jan.
20, 1745) was unable to prevent the election of the Prince of
Tuscany, husband of Maria Theresa, who ascended the Imperial
throne as Francis I. Maximilian, the son of the late Emperor, had
shown himself willing to accept the views of Austria; by the
Treaty of Fuessen (April 22, 1745) he renounced all claims to the
Austrian succession, promising to recall his troops from the French
armies, and to give his vote to Francis, husband of Maria Theresa,
who on her side recognized the election of his late father, and
restored all her Bavarian conquests. Again it appeared that general
negotiations might have been possible. But Carteret had been
<span class="sidenote">Changes in the ministry. Nov. 1744.</span>
driven from office, and the Whigs under Pelham were bent on carrying on
their hostility with France. His unpopular Hanoverian tendencies, and the
offhand manner in which he had treated the Pelhams, secured Carteret's
fall. His place was taken by Walpole's old colleague Harrington. With
Carteret withdrew Lord Winchelsea and several others, thus affording Mr.
Pelham an opportunity for carrying out that form of administration to
which his timidity urged him. In exact contrast to Walpole, he dreaded
opposition, and sought to make friends of all parties, and to establish
his ministry on what was then called a broad bottom. He persuaded
Chesterfield and Pitt to give up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_997" id="Page_997">[997]</a></span>
opposition, and the former to accept the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland.
To the Tory Lord Gower he gave the Privy Seal, and even Sir John Hind
Cotton, an undoubted Jacobite, was given a place about the Court. This
was not done without great opposition from the King, who disliked
Chesterfield and Pitt for their opposition to his Hanoverian schemes,
and had a natural mistrust of Tories and Jacobites. The effect of these
changes was almost to suppress opposition in the House. The ministry, now
including most of the leaders of the Opposition, satisfied with a change
of principles, made but little change in practice. The reunited Whig
party felt that, as they were engaged in an open war with France, they
were, even while subsidizing Germans, carrying out their true policy.
Pitt openly declared that he no longer opposed subsidies in face of the
present state of affairs abroad. He pointed out that the object of the
war was somewhat changed, that, the minister who rested wholly on his
foreign influence being removed, they were no longer fighting
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFIVE_GERMAN_SUBSIDIES_GRANTED" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFIVE_GERMAN_SUBSIDIES_GRANTED"></a>German subsidies granted. 1745.</span> solely in
the interests of Austria, but to secure an equitable peace for themselves
and their allies. However this may have been, the system of German
subsidies went further and further. The Hanoverian troops were for the
present dismissed, but their pay was added to the Austrian subsidy.
Saxony was bought, the Elector of Cologne was bought, and so was the
Elector of Mayence; and next year (1746) 18,000 Hanoverians were again
taken into English pay. Robert Walpole lived just long enough to see the
dangers he had kept aloof for twenty years gathering round England. He
died in March 1745, leaving England plunged deep in a Continental war,
with constantly increasing grants for military service, and consequently
increased financial difficulties, and on the eve of the most determined
and dangerous effort which the exiled family ever made for the recovery
of their crown.</p>

<p>The war still continued under the mistaken conduct of the French. But
neither their successes against England at Fontenoy, nor the invasion
of the young Pretender which they supported, nor their victory over the
Sardinians at Basignano, were the least decisive. As Frederick, who felt
himself deserted, bitterly said, the victories might as well have been
won on the banks of the Scamander. What he could do singlehanded the
Prussian King did. He defeated the Austrians at Friedberg, and again upon
the Sohr. He conquered the Saxons at Kesseldorf and occupied Dresden. But
seeing clearly that his allies were bent upon their own ends, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_998" id="Page_998">[998]</a></span>
again listened to the anti-Bourbon diplomacy of England, made a
separate peace with Austria, and the Treaty of Dresden (Dec. 25,
1745) closed the second Silesian war. But, in spite of the withdrawal
of Prussia, the general war continued. Early in the spring
a French army under Marshal Saxe invested Tournay. The Netherlands
were occupied by an allied army of English and Dutch. There
<span class="sidenote">Campaign in Flanders.</span> should have been
28,000 English and 50,000 Dutch, but, although it was their own country
that was threatened, the Dutch were so dilatory that the allied army
numbered little more than 50,000. These were under the Duke of Cumberland
and the Dutch general the Prince of Waldeck. The Duke, who was young,
was somewhat controlled by the Austrian Marshal Konigsegg, and had with
him as his military guide General Ligonier. With these troops the Duke
advanced to the relief of Tournay. Marshal Saxe, whose forces were much
superior in numbers, could afford to leave 15,000 men to continue the
siege, while, marching southward along the river, he occupied a very
strong position to cover his operations. The position was rendered almost
unassailable. The French faced southward; on their right was the river
Scheldt, with the fortified bridge securing their communication and
retreat, and the village Antoing. A narrow and difficult valley ran along
their front from Antoing to Fontenoy, and their left was covered by the
wood of Barré, on the right of which a redoubt had been constructed. The
whole of this position was fortified with field-works and abattis, with
the exception of a gap between Fontenoy and the wood of Barré, where the
difficulties of the approach were held to be of themselves sufficient.
It was resolved to assault this terribly strong position. To the Dutch
was intrusted the attack of the French right, with the villages Antoing
and Fontenoy; to the English the attack on their left. The attack of
the Dutch was without energy, and failed, and the Prince of Waldeck,
withdrawing his troops to a safe distance, kept them unemployed the
remainder of the day. A <span class="sidenote">Battle of Fontenoy. May 11, 1745.</span>
similar want of energy was exhibited by General Ingoldsby, who had been
instructed to assault a redoubt on the left of the French and to clear
the wood of Barré. Finding more opposition than he expected, he withdrew
when the enemy were on the point of abandoning their redoubt, and
demanded further orders. The English and Hanoverians, on the other hand,
energetically assaulted the unfortified gap between Fontenoy and the
wood. Regardless of the flanking fire by which they were decimated,
they pushed across the ravine and up the opposite hill. The space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_999" id="Page_999">[999]</a></span>
was narrow, and they advanced, without deploying, in a solid column
10,000 strong with a face of about forty men. The ground was too rough
for their cavalry, which therefore advanced in their rear. In this solid
formation, with astonishing heroism and determination, they pushed on,
crushing all opposition, and unchecked by frequent cavalry charges.
They won the crown of the position, cut the enemy's centre, and were
moving onwards towards the bridge of Calonne, threatening thus to cut
off all retreat from the broken army. The victory seemed decided, and
Voltaire allows that, had the Dutch only moved, the French must have been
inevitably routed and destroyed. But the Prince of Waldeck never stirred.
Fresh troops could therefore be brought from Antoing and Fontenoy to
repel the victorious column. In this work it was the Irish Brigade which
chiefly distinguished itself, and at last when, by the advice of the
Duc de Richelieu, four cannon were placed right in front of the column
so as to fire down its whole length, finding itself wholly unsupported,
the heroic body began to give ground. It retired as it had come, slowly,
disputing every yard, and entirely without confusion. When it reached
ground where cavalry could act, that arm, hitherto useless, covered the
retreat, and the whole army fell back to Ath. Tournay was treacherously
surrendered, and the allies had to content themselves with covering
Brussels and Antwerp. This wonderful unsupported advance, though useless
for the battle, and purchased with immense loss of life, was for long a
just source of pride to the English soldier.</p>

<p>It was the necessity of withdrawing troops for the defence of
England which had rendered the campaign in Flanders after the
partial defeat of Fontenoy so disastrous. Prince Charles Edward,
though bitterly disappointed by the failure of the expedition in the
preceding year, did not leave France; and as the French ministry,
occupied with their continental affairs, refused him further assistance,
he determined to go alone and unsupported to Scotland, and throw
<span class="sidenote">Prince Charles Edward lands in Scotland.</span>
himself on the loyalty of his friends there, although in all his previous
negotiations with them they had refused to think of a rising unsupported
by foreign troops and arms. Scraping together what little money he could,
and purchasing a small supply of firearms, the Prince embarked at Nantes
in a privateer. He was escorted, without the knowledge of the Government,
by a French man-of-war, in which his stores were placed. On the passage
to England they encountered an English vessel, which, though unable to
capture the French man-of-war engaged it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1000" id="Page_1000">[1000]</a></span>
vigorously that it had to withdraw to France to refit, and it was in the
little privateer, 'La Doutelle,' thus stripped of his supplies and with
only seven companions, that the Prince reached the Hebrides. In this
plight he met but a cold reception, and it was not without considerable
persuasion that Macdonald of Clanranald and other gentlemen of that
tribe joined him. Their chief, Sir Alexander Macdonald, and the head of
the Macleods, on whose assistance he had relied, kept aloof. Of more
importance even than the Macdonalds was the adhesion of Cameron of
Lochiel. This chief seems to have been won, against his better judgment,
by the persuasive power of Charles, who undoubtedly had in an unusual
degree the art of attracting adherents. While still in the extreme west
of the mainland Charles was joined by Murray of Broughton, who had been
his chief agent, and whom he appointed his Secretary of State. The Prince
had reached the mainland on the 25th of July; it was not till the 30th
that information was received by the Government that he had left Nantes,
and he had been three weeks in Scotland before it was known in London.
On the 19th of August the insurrectionary standard was raised in the
solitary valley of Glen Finnan, where the aged Marquis of Tullibardine,
the rightful heir to the dukedom of Athol, read Prince Charles's
Commission of Regency. This ceremony was graced by the presence of a
considerable number of English prisoners, who had been captured a few
days previously by Lochiel's followers as they were marching to reinforce
Fort William.</p>

<p>Scotland is cleft in sunder by a great valley running from the Beauley
Firth in the north-east in a south-westerly direction to the salt-water
lake Loch Eil. This valley, at present occupied by the Caledonian Canal,
forms the basin of a chain of lakes, by far the largest of which is Loch
Ness, occupying nearly half of the north-east end of the valley. Between
its northern extremity and the sea lies the town of Inverness; at its
southern end was Fort Augustus, one of the forts established to keep the
Highlands in check, while, where the valley reaches Loch Eil, there was
the still more lonely post of Fort William immediately under Ben Nevis.
It was in the close neighbourhood of this fort that Charles's followers
were first collected, and it was while trying to strengthen it that the
royal troops had first come into collision with the insurgents. The
tribes to the north of Inverness, as well as Sir Alexander Macdonald and
Macleod, were either well-affected or held in neutrality chiefly by the
influence of Duncan Forbes of Culloden, Lord President, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1001" id="Page_1001">[1001]</a></span>
also contrived for the present to attach Lord Lovat, head of the Frasers,
to the Government interest, so that it was with the western clans only
that Charles began his expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cope marches against him.</div>




<p>The English military commander in Scotland was Sir John Cope, who had
altogether about 3000 men under his command. All this time the King was
absent from England, and orders had to be issued by the Lords Justices.
They approved however of Cope's plan for immediately marching into the
Highlands and crushing the insurgents if possible among the mountains.
With this intention, leaving his dragoons behind him, Cope set out from
Stirling along the direct north road towards Inverness. At Dalwhinnie,
which is now a posting-station on the great north road, the military road
made by Marshal Wade branched off to Fort Augustus, which it was Cope's
object to reach and relieve; the main road passed onwards to Inverness.
The mountain which forms the south-east side of the great valley in
which Fort Augustus lies has to be crossed. It is called in this place
Corrie-Arrack, and to cross it the road winds in steep zigzags. The
Highlanders had got possession of this difficult pass, and intended to
destroy Cope's army while ascending the zigzags. Their disappointment was
great when they found that he had turned aside at Dalwhinnie, and was in
hasty march for Inverness. By this means he probably hoped to strengthen
the loyal clans of the north and to draw the Prince's army in pursuit.
He however left the road towards the capital quite unguarded. Charles
at once pushed on and crossed the Badenoch mountains to Blair Athol,
from whence the great road runs, without any obstacle, through the Pass
of Killiecrankie <span class="sidenote">Charles avoids him, and gains
Edinburgh.</span> into the plains of Perthshire. He rested a few days at
Perth, where he was joined by Drummond, Duke of Perth, and by Lord George
Murray, the Duke of Athol's brother, a man of considerable military
experience and capacity. He then crossed the Forth a little above
Stirling, the dragoon regiments which had been left there retiring before
him, and advanced rapidly towards Edinburgh. The Castle of Edinburgh was
secure, but the town had no adequate fortifications, and the inhabitants
doubted long and painfully as to whether they should open their gates
or not. The news that Cope, on learning his mistake, had taken ship and
had already reached Dunbar, encouraged them to think of resistance, but
their determination vanished away after a skirmish called "the canter of
Colt-Brig," when two regiments of dragoons ran away, and did not stop
till they reached Dunbar. Negotiations were set on foot, but
were cut short by the surprise of the town by the Highlanders. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1002" id="Page_1002">[1002]</a></span>
the 17th of September Charles took possession of Holyrood House, and
it seemed as if the inhabitants of Edinburgh were by no means sorry to
<span class="sidenote">Cope lands at Dunbar.</span> receive him.
He could not rest long, however, as Cope was marching along the Firth
from Dunbar. He expected to meet his enemy between that town and
Edinburgh, but the Prince marched along the hills to the south of the
Firth, and Cope was surprised to find his enemy again beyond him. He
was then near Prestonpans. He changed his face at once, and lay with
his back to the Firth and his face to the hills, as he believed in an
unassailable position, separated from the Highlanders by a morass. But
Charles was bent on fighting, and a narrow pathway through the morass to
the eastward was pointed out to him. Down this he led his forces so as to
gain a position eastward of the English, who had again to change their
face, looking now directly eastward, with their backs to Edinburgh. Their
infantry were in the centre, their cavalry on
<span class="sidenote">Is defeated at Prestonpans. Sept. 21.</span>
either flank. The battle is said to have been decided in six minutes. The
rush of the Highlanders renewed the panic among the dragoons, who all
took to their heels. The infantry stood with their flanks exposed, and as
their fire did not check the Highlanders, they were soon engaged at close
quarters, where the Highland target parried the bayonet thrust, while the
right hand was free to use the claymore. The line was soon broken, and
it is said that not more than 170 escaped death or capture. The cavalry,
taking Cope with them, did not draw bridle till they reached Berwick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indifference of England.</div>

<p>Some preparations had been made in England to withstand the advance
of the rebels. Marshal Wade was at Newcastle with such troops as he
could collect, the Dutch were called upon to supply, in accordance with
their treaty, 6000 men, and some regiments were recalled from Flanders.
But throughout the population of England there was now, and through
the whole campaign, a strange carelessness as to which side should
prove victorious. The Revolution had been, comparatively speaking, an
aristocratic movement. It had moved the power from the Crown only to
put it in the hands of the nobles. Parliament was so far from being an
adequate representative body, that the disputes carried on in it excited
no very warm interest in the nation at large. At times indeed it was
necessary for the Opposition to excite the people by some national cry;
but that Opposition had uniformly employed the most violent language
against the Hanoverian influence and the minister of the Hanoverian
King. Such partial views therefore as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1003" id="Page_1003">[1003]</a></span>
the people had been allowed of what was going on among their governors
had all tended rather to direct the loyalty, which was then so inherent
a characteristic of the English, towards the exiled house. Except in
the matter of religion, the people at large were able to discover but
little difference whether their king was a Stuart or a Guelph; and on
this occasion the assurance had been carefully spread that the privileges
of the Church of England would not be touched; indeed one of Charles's
difficulties arose from the jealousy of his Protestant followers. The
class who had gained by the Revolution was that class which Walpole and
Walpole's policy had chiefly favoured&mdash;the middle class; but as
usual the middle class was apathetic and slow to risk anything unless for
some personal object. At first therefore it was the Government, unaided
by the people, which had to check the insurrection. It will be seen that
afterwards the aristocracy offered, though in a very selfish manner, to
come forward, and that some towns, especially in Scotland, awoke to their
responsibilities, but on the whole it was the Government alone which
had to act by means of its soldiers, and England had been stripped of
soldiers for its foreign wars. On the other hand, the Jacobites had seen
the insurrection of 1715 so thoroughly futile, and had during Walpole's
long administration so settled down under the existing Government,
that only a few of the more enthusiastic took a real interest in the
quarrel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles marches into England as far as Derby,</div>

<p>Had Prince Charles advanced immediately after the battle of
Prestonpans he would have found himself almost unopposed; but by the time
he had collected some money, gathered in his reinforcements, organized
his army, and persuaded the Highlanders to cross the border, Marshal
Wade's army had increased to 10,000; the Dutch and English troops had
come from abroad; there was a second army under the Duke of Cumberland
formed in the centre of England; the guards and trained bands had marched
out to Finchley and formed a third body, which the King declared he
would himself lead. To turn the position of Wade at Newcastle it was
determined, as in 1715, to march along behind the Cheviots and enter
England by Carlisle; and the clans (about 6000 strong) crossed the
Border on the 8th of November. Carlisle yielded without much difficulty,
and on the recommendation of Lord George Murray, who now assumed the
military command of the army, it was determined to advance into the heart
of England. In two bodies they marched up the Eden over Shap Fell to
Lancaster and to Preston; the Prince winning the heart of the
Highlanders by wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1004" id="Page_1004">[1004]</a></span>
their dress and marching at the head of the second division, as strong
and unwearied as the best among them, for he was gifted with a fine
athletic body, which he had further trained by constant exercise. His
carriage he insisted upon offering to the aged Lord Pitsligo. His care
for his followers, of which this is an instance, tended much to endear
him to them; he was at this part of his life adorned with many of the
best graces of a king; his clemency was the constant complaint of his
sterner counsellors. It is said indeed to have encouraged more than one
attempt at assassination. Towards his enemy, the Elector as he called
him, he was also studiously merciful and dignified. In all negotiations
with his followers or with the French the safety of the Hanoverian
Elector and his family was bargained for; and even when £30,000 was
put upon his head, dead or alive, after entirely refusing to make a
counter proclamation, he insisted on offering only £30. This was indeed
afterwards overruled, and a larger reward offered, but he even then
said he felt sure no follower of his was capable of winning it, and the
proclamation ended: "Should any fatal accident happen from hence let
the blame lie entirely at the door of those who first set the infamous
example."</p>

<p>The army passed Preston, that ill-omened town to the Stuart cause, in
all haste, entered Manchester, where they met with more recruits than
usual, skilfully deceived the Duke of Cumberland into the idea that they
were marching towards Wales, got past his army, and had nothing between
them and London except the camp at Finchley. They reached Derby, but
there Lord George Murray and all the commanders unanimously advised
retreat. It was true that they had eluded both Wade and Cumberland,
but those commanders with their armies were following them close; the
slightest check before reaching London, and their little army of 5000
would be enveloped by 30,000 men; it would surely be better to fall back
upon their supports in Scotland, where Lord Strathallan had a force of
some 3000 or 4000 men. Charles was unable to hold out against these
arguments, backed by all the men of military weight in his army, and very
sullenly and unwillingly at length gave his consent to a retreat. It is
plain that the Scotch chiefs had been thoroughly disappointed in the
neutrality of the English population, were beginning to fear for their
own heads, and thought it more prudent as well as more practicable to
separate the two kingdoms, and establish <span class="sidenote">but retreats,
to the relief of the government.</span> Charles at all events at first as
King of Scotland. This determination was an immense relief to the
Government. Whether a further march would have been successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1005" id="Page_1005">[1005]</a></span>
or not, it is certain that the Government regarded its chances of success
as very great, and London was stricken with panic; the Bank was reduced
to pay in sixpences; the Duke of Newcastle is said to have seriously
thought of declaring for the Pretender; the King sent some of his
valuables to the river ready for embarkation. The camp at Finchley was
by no means completed; Wade and Cumberland were so far behind that
they scarcely hoped to come up with the Highlanders; the occupation of
London would have been the signal for a French invasion, and probably
for a great Jacobite rising in England. The day on which the news of the
advance to Derby was known was called Black Friday.</p>

<p>The retreat was very rapid, and, as was natural, now that the
soldiers were in bad humour, by no means orderly. The insurgents
were closely pursued by the Duke of Cumberland, who came up with
them, but was checked in a skirmish near Penrith, and passing
through Carlisle, which was speedily recaptured by the English,
reached Glasgow, where they established themselves, and by means of
large requisitions succeeded in refreshing and reorganizing themselves
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYSIX_CHARLES_BESIEGES_STIRLING" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYSIX_CHARLES_BESIEGES_STIRLING"></a>Charles besieges Stirling. Jan. 3, 1746.</span>
after their rapid march. They had marched 580 miles in 56 days. After
a week's rest they advanced to besiege the Castle of Stirling, which
was defended by General Blakeney. Being joined by the Scotch army under
Strathallan, with whom were some French soldiers, and Lord John Drummond,
a general in the French service, the Pretender's army reached the number
of 9000, the largest he ever commanded. Wade, who had grown slow from
age, was superseded by General Hawley by the advice of the Duke of
Cumberland. He was an officer of some experience, but little talent, and
of a ferocious disposition. He was nicknamed the Lord Chief Justice, and
as Horace Walpole tells us, "was brave and able, with no small bias to
the brutal." He profoundly despised his enemies, and advancing to relieve
Stirling Castle, took up his position at Falkirk without even ordinary
military precaution. He was not even present with his army, but was
enjoying, with some of his officers, the civilities of Callendar House,
where the Countess of <span class="sidenote">Wins the battle of Falkirk. Jan. 17.</span>
Kilmarnock, whose husband was with the Pretender, was entertaining and
delaying them. There are two roads between Stirling and Falkirk; some
troops were sent forward by the straight road to deceive the English,
while the main body under Charles swept round to the south. They were
then separated from the English by a high rugged heath called Falkirk
Muir. When the news of their approach was brought to Hawley, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1006" id="Page_1006">[1006]</a></span>
hastened to the field, and led his cavalry rapidly forward to try
and secure the crest of this hill. It was a race between him and the
Highlanders, and they succeeded in winning it. Hawley fell back to lower
ground, and arranged his troops, with their right upon a broken ravine
which descended to the plain. His artillery got hopelessly jammed in
a morass. The battle began with a charge of the royal cavalry on the
left, which was met by a steady fire from the Highlanders, from which
the dragoons as usual fled, all but one regiment. The Highlanders, then
rushing forward, entirely broke the centre and left of the royal army,
but their rush was checked by the ravine on the right; the royal troops
there held their own, and being joined by the one steady regiment of
cavalry, were enabled to make an orderly retreat. One of the flying
regiments had fought well at Fontenoy, and Lord John Drummond, who had
been present at that battle, believed that their retreat was a feint,
and by his advice further attack was suspended. Charles had shown
considerable skill in bringing his troops with their back to the wind, so
that the driving storm and cold January wind might beat full in the faces
of the English troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cumberland takes command of the army.</div>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, who had been detained in the south of England
in expectation of a French invasion, was indignant at this defeat, and
declaring that he would himself willingly lead the broken remains of
Hawley's army against the Highlanders, got himself appointed commander.
He was a young man of great energy, with the hereditary bravery of his
family, and an active if not a very able general; he had, moreover, won
the confidence of the army at Fontenoy. He was a man however of violent
passions, and at present roused almost to ferocity by the success of
the Highlanders, which touched his pride both as a military man and a
prince of the Hanoverian house. The Pretender did not follow up his
success, but persisted, from a false sense of honour, in the siege of
Stirling, and allowed the broken English army to be reconstituted. He
was however obliged to desist from this project by a memorial signed by
all his chiefs, and presented by Lord George Murray. Some coldness had
arisen between the Prince and his followers ever since the retreat from
Derby, and the present prudent counsel tended still further to widen the
breach. The army was divided into two bodies, and marched rapidly towards
Inverness, where they were to unite. Cumberland hastened in pursuit.
Inverness was easily mastered, and the neighbouring clan, the
Mackintoshes, joined the Prince. But the English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1007" id="Page_1007">[1007]</a></span>
now fully on the alert, prevented the arrival of any supplies from
France, and the army was suffering from want of provisions and money.
Cumberland's army was meanwhile well supplied from the sea, and marched
towards Inverness along the coast from Aberdeen. The passages of the
rivers, Spey, Findhorn, and Nairn, were but weakly disputed, and on
the 14th of April the royal army entered the town of Nairn. That night
Charles slept at Culloden House, the seat of President Forbes, who
had fled on his approach. Want of provisions, and the habit of the
Highlanders of returning at times to their homes, had reduced his army
to about 5000, and of these many were absent from the standards in
Inverness and <span class="sidenote">He defeats Charles at Culloden,
April 16,</span> elsewhere searching for food. It was determined, at
the suggestion of Charles and Lord George Murray, to attempt a night
surprise, but the darkness of the night and the weariness of the men
prevented its success, and the hour proposed for the attack still found
them four miles from the English posts. They fell back to Culloden Moor.
Murray and some others wanted to retire, but Charles and some of his
more reckless followers from France, in overweening trust in the dash of
the Highlanders, insisted upon fighting. The men of Athol, the Camerons
and the Stuarts, had the right of the line under Lord George Murray,
while the Macdonalds, who claimed that position ever since the battle of
Bannockburn, sulkily received orders to occupy the left. Taught by former
experience, the Duke of Cumberland ranged his army in three lines, with
cannon between every two regiments, the second line being drawn up three
deep, and arranged as men now are when forming square to receive cavalry.
The opening cannonade was wholly in favour of the English, and observing
the loss of his followers, Murray advanced with the right. Wearied and
harassed as they were, the Highlanders broke through the first line,
and captured two cannon, but the firm formation and scathing fire of
the second line threw them into hopeless confusion. On the left of the
Highland line the Macdonalds, aggrieved at their position, remained
immoveable, in spite of the urgent entreaties of their commander, in
spite even of the touching words of Macdonald of Keppoch, who cried
as he fell, "My God, have the children of my tribe forsaken me!" They
afterwards fell back and joined the second line. They were however now
outflanked, and their retreat threatened, and though there were some
thoughts of trying to retrieve the fortunes of the day with the unbroken
left, the more prudent officers regarded the battle as lost,
and compelled Charles to fly. He went first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1008" id="Page_1008">[1008]</a></span>
all to Lord Lovat's residence, but, finding but a cold reception from
that scheming villain, who was trying to keep well with the Government,
while he had sent his son and clan to join the Prince, he fled onwards
till he reached the Castle of Glengarry, beyond Fort Augustus. The broken
fragments of his army were collected, about 1200 in number, by the skill
of Lord George Murray at Ruthven in Badenoch. But Charles gave up the
struggle, and sent orders that they should look to their own safety.
The insurrection was over: vengeance began. The cruelty with which that
vengeance was executed gained Cumberland <span class="sidenote">and
cruelly suppresses the rebellion.</span> the nickname of "The Butcher."
In the pursuit after Culloden but little quarter was given, and acts of
brutal ferocity stained the glory of the day. Some wounded Highlanders
who had crawled to a farm building were deliberately burnt to death in
it. The prisoners were kept in want of the necessaries of life, and
many of the wounded put to death in cold blood. Cumberland fixed his
headquarters at Fort Augustus, and harried the neighbouring country with
every species of military execution. Acts of cruelty and of wild license
were done chiefly at the instigation of General Hawley, but not without
Cumberland's knowledge. The Duke was however, and rightly, hailed as the
saviour of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles escapes to France.</div>

<p>For five months Charles was a solitary fugitive in the Highlands
and Hebrides. He frequently had to trust his secret to the poorest
Highlanders, but the high price set on his head never induced them
for a moment to break their faith. His best known escape took place
in South Uist, whither he had been tracked very shortly after the
battle of Culloden, and where he was surrounded by upwards of 2000 men.
Flora Macdonald, a young lady visiting Clanranald's family, succeeded
in bringing him safely through this difficulty by procuring from her
stepfather, who was an officer in the King's army, a passport for
herself and a female servant. In this disguise she took Charles with her
into Skye, where, making his secret known to the wife of Sir Alexander
Macdonald, who was in the King's interest, she by her means got him
put under the charge of Macdonald of Kingsburgh, who brought him to a
place of safety. We are told that his height and want of grace in the
management of his petticoats, especially in passing the watercourses,
very nearly betrayed him. Flora Macdonald afterwards married the son of
Macdonald of Kingsburgh. At last, on the 20th September, attended
by Lochiel and a considerable number of other fugitives, he set sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1009" id="Page_1009">[1009]</a></span>
for France from Loch-na-Nuagh, the very spot where he had landed
fourteen months before.</p>

<p>Thus terminated a most romantic piece of military history, astonishing
both in the success which the small body of Highlanders were able to gain
and the rapidity with which their successes were brought to an end. Had
Lord George Murray been a worse general, and had the Scotch chiefs had
less at heart the separation of Scotland from England, the success of the
enterprise might have been different.</p>

<p>At the two critical periods of the war, at Derby and after the battle
of Falkirk, Charles was probably right in disliking any retrograde
movements. No doubt, on purely military grounds, his opinion was wrong;
but a body of half-trained enthusiastic Highlanders are nothing unless
victorious. The marked change visible in their retreat both from Derby
and from Stirling, on both of which occasions great disorder and want
of discipline arose, shows that the moral side of the movement was not
sufficiently considered by the generals. On the other hand, Lord George
Murray showed great skill in hoodwinking and passing the armies both of
Wade and Cumberland, and much good judgment in refusing to introduce
regular drill or arms among the Highland regiments. The Lords Balmerino
and Kilmarnock were beheaded for their share in the conspiracy, and
Lord Lovat, wily though he had been, was convicted on the evidence of
the Prince's Secretary of State, Murray of Broughton, who turned King's
evidence, and executed. Many stringent measures against the Highlanders
were at once passed, such as the Disarming Act, the Act to forbid the
wearing of the Highland dress, and more important, an Act for the
abolition of heritable jurisdictions, by which the arbitrary power of
the chiefs of the clans was destroyed, and regular tribunals under
responsible judges established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ministerial crisis. Feb. 1746.</div>

<p>At the very time that the Highlanders were still in the country
England had passed through a ministerial crisis. The Pelhams had found
themselves thwarted and in danger of being supplanted by Granville
(Carteret); for although they had succeeded in driving him from the
ministry, he was still the King's favourite&mdash;a position which he had
earned by constantly seconding the royal wishes with regard to foreign
politics. The chief opponents of these views were Pitt and Chesterfield,
and the Pelhams now determined upon bringing matters to a crisis by
demanding the admission of Pitt into the ministry. The King, influenced
by Lord Granville and Lord Bath, refused to admit him, and the Pelhams,
their friend Lord Harrington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1010" id="Page_1010">[1010]</a></span>
(Stanhope), and their whole party resigned. The King at once instructed
Lord Granville to form a new Government. He undertook the task, but
three days sufficed to show that the King's favour was no match for the
Parliamentary influence of the great Whig party, of which Newcastle was
the acknowledged leader. Much against his will, the King had to receive
back his old ministry upon any terms they chose to propose, and Pitt
became first Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, and shortly afterwards Paymaster
of the Forces. In this position he was enabled much to increase his
popularity, by rejecting the vast profits which it had been the habit
hitherto for the Paymaster to make. That officer had been in the habit
of receiving a large percentage upon all foreign subsidies, and of using
as his own the interest accruing from the large balance of public money
he had constantly in hand. These profits Pitt rejected, and at once
established a reputation for disinterestedness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYSEVEN_EFFECT_OF_THE_REBELLION" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYSEVEN_EFFECT_OF_THE_REBELLION"></a>Effect of the rebellion on the continental
war.</div>

<p>The insurrection in Scotland had had considerable effect upon the
continental war. The campaign in Flanders, where the Austrians had been
deprived of English succour, had been very unfavourable, and after the
battle of Raucoux, the French, under Marshal Saxe, had mastered nearly
the whole of the Austrian Netherlands. But, deprived of their Bavarian
allies by the Treaty of Fuessen, of the Prussians by the Treaty of
Dresden, and all hearty support from Spain by the death of Philip V.,
they began to think of peace, and negotiations were opened at Breda. Lord
Harrington, having fallen under the King's displeasure for his conduct in
the ministerial crisis, had resigned, and Chesterfield was called from
the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to become Secretary of State. He at once
began to use his influence, which was very great, both from his social
gifts and from his eloquence, in favour of peace, so that there seemed
some hopes of a cessation of the war. It was pursued however without
check during the whole of the next year. In Holland the appearance of
20,000 French within the frontier roused the national spirit, and the
people, disgusted with the dilatory conduct of their republican chiefs,
rose in revolution; they again looked for safety to the house of Nassau,
and the young Prince of Orange, a son-in-law of George II., was made
hereditary Stadtholder. In conjunction with the Duke of Cumberland
he took command of the army in Flanders, but was defeated with much
loss to the English at the battle of Laufeldt. The great fortress of
Bergen-op-Zoom was taken, and at length Maestricht, on the safety of
which Holland depended, was itself besieged. To balance these disasters,
the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1011" id="Page_1011">[1011]</a></span>
war in Italy had been constantly disastrous to France. The Austrians,
freed from the pressure of Frederick on the north, were able to act
with vigour. They were so successful that Genoa was taken, and Provence
itself invaded; and though in the following year the Austrians were
driven from France and Genoa regained, the war in that direction closed
with a complete victory over the French at Exiles, and the French troops
withdrew to their own country, not to appear in Italy again till the
renewed vigour of the Revolution plunged them afresh into a career of
conquest. Meanwhile, however, in spite of these disasters upon land,
England had been steadily gaining its real object. Holland, whose
political importance had almost disappeared, and which had become a
faithful follower of England, was still more closely joined to that
country by its late revolution. Upon the sea disaster everywhere met
the French. Their colonial empire was attacked, Cape Breton Island was
captured, and the St. Lawrence and Canada thus laid open to the English.
Their navy gradually dwindled away, till it was represented by three
or four ships only. They were wearied of the war, and alarmed at the
immense addition to their debt. The Dutch were disappointed at the want
of success which had attended their revolution; and the English were
satisfied with the destruction of the French marine. All parties were
thus at length ready to listen to a reasonable peace.</p>

<p>It was therefore determined to hold a congress at Aix-la-Chapelle.
Moreover, the Pelhams had now resumed in some degree the pacific policy
of Walpole, and the apparent certainty of the fall of Maestricht brought
matters to a crisis. On the 30th of April the preliminaries were signed
between France, England and Holland, <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYEIGHT_TREATY_OF_AIX_LA_CHAPELLE" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYEIGHT_TREATY_OF_AIX_LA_CHAPELLE"></a>Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle. Oct. 1748.</span> without waiting for the agreement
of Austria and Spain. The terms of those preliminaries befitted the
causeless war which they terminated. The chief condition was the complete
mutual restoration of all conquests, and the return of each party to its
position before the war. There were, however, some slight changes; Parma
was to be given to the Infant Don Philip; the cessions of Austria to
both Prussia and Sardinia were to be secured, and Spain was to restore
the Assiento Treaty and the right of a periodical vessel in the South
Seas to the English, while the fortifications of Dunkirk towards the sea
were to be destroyed; in exchange for its losses Austria received the
complete guarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction and the acknowledgment of
the Emperor. The restoration of conquests <span class="sidenote">Results
of the war.</span> touched even India, where the conquest of Madras and
the resistance of Pondicherry to the English arms had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1012" id="Page_1012">[1012]</a></span>
raised in the minds of the French well-grounded hopes of founding a
colonial empire. Taking the war as a whole its results were these:
Holland had disappeared from the rank of great nations; it was evident
that it could not defend itself against France. Austria, though it had
lost Silesia, had learnt the strength to be derived from the military
resources of its eastern provinces. Prussia had proved itself a
predominant power in Europe. England had secured its maritime supremacy.
France had exhibited its growing weakness, had lost its best opportunity
of re-establishing itself upon the sea, and under a show of magnanimous
generosity had made plain to the world its total absence of good
government, of good administration, or good diplomacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pelham's conciliatory government.</div>

<p>The period of the premiership of Henry Pelham is marked by the absence
of parliamentary contest. Taught by the stormy close of Walpole's career,
he so far deviated from his master's precepts, that, instead of wishing
to stand alone in his government, his chief object was to conciliate all
parties, and the broad ministry over which he presided included nearly
all the men of striking talent in Parliament. There was no opposition
worth mentioning, except a little clique who gathered round the Prince of
Wales, and at whose head was Doddington. It was not till the death of Mr.
Pelham in 1754 that the strife of parties again began.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTY_HIS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTY_HIS_FINANCIAL_MEASURES"></a>His financial measures. 1750.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the system of subsidies to foreign powers was quietly
carried on, even Pitt ceasing to raise his voice against them. The lull
of party strife, and the strength of his position, enabled the minister,
who was a good financier, to alleviate what was then considered a very
threatening danger to the country, and at the same time to demonstrate
the firm and constant increase of the national wealth. He determined to
introduce a measure (1750) for the reduction of the debt, which was at
that time about £78,000,000, paying an interest of £3,000,000 a year.
This sum was at that time regarded as very formidable. But Pelham,
rightly thinking that the country could well bear the amount of debt,
directed his attention not to diminishing the capital but to lowering
the rate of interest. This plan had indeed been carried out constantly
since the time of William III., and as the operation had been always
successful, it marks the increased confidence of the nation in the
Government, and the increased wealth of the nation, since money could be
procured at gradually cheapening rates. Under William III. eight per cent.
had been given: under Queen Anne the interest had been reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1013" id="Page_1013">[1013]</a></span>
to six: under George I. to five and to four; Pelham now proposed to
reduce it to three per cent. In spite of some natural opposition the Bill
was carried. Those who were unwilling to receive the reduced interest,
and there were few such, received their capital from money borrowed
at three per cent. The rest accepted the terms, which were three and
a half, for the next eight years, and three per cent. after 1758. The
annual saving was more than half a million, and Smollett says that Europe
saw with wonder England reducing the national obligations immediately
after a war which had almost ruined Europe. Three millions was indeed a
considerable charge upon a revenue amounting to about £8,523,540. This
was derived from four principal sources;&mdash;more than £3,800,000 from
Excise and Malt Tax, £1,900,000 and over from the customs; £1,637,608
from the Land Tax, and the rest from the stamp duties and other small
sources. The late war had cost the nation upwards of £30,000,000, and
many financiers, not foreseeing the enormous development of the national
resources which the next half century would produce, took a gloomy view
of the financial position of England. But, as we have seen, the ease with
which Pelham completed the reduction of the interest proved that there
was considerable wealth in the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of wealth and trade.</div>

<p>Indeed, although the great industrial period had not yet quite
arrived, both commerce and manufactures were making considerable strides,
and that wealth was accumulating which was to find its employment in
the next decade. Several branches of foreign trade had been relieved
from restrictions&mdash;whale and herring fisheries, the African trade
and the silk trade had all been relieved, while manufactures had been
steadily increasing. As early as 1715 silk spinning had been introduced
at Derby; and the woollen manufactures, which, with the silk, were
heavily protected, were of great and increasing importance. The use of
cotton, which was to change the whole face of Lancashire, was regarded
most unwisely as injurious, and but little use was made of it except
for mixing with silk and wool, and in a small degree for exportation.
Protection of silk and wool even went so far that penalties were laid on
the wearing and selling of calico goods. Both in Birmingham and Sheffield
metal works were largely established, and silver plated upon other
metals, which was introduced at Sheffield in 1742, was soon widely used
under the title of Sheffield plate. Improvements, too, had also been made
in the stocking-frame, and, in 1738, John Kaye had invented his shuttle,
which doubled the amount of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">[1014]</a></span>
which could be done. But while cotton was as yet scarcely thought of, and
improvements in the old manufactures were only introduced by degrees,
the second great source of English wealth was discovered and set to
work. The quantity of iron in the United Kingdom is very large, but keen
observers complained that, while there was plenty for our own supply
and for exportation, we still imported largely from America, where it
could be worked cheaper. This was because it had been thought necessary
that iron should be smelted with charcoal, and as carriage was as yet
wholly by land and expensive, it was only when iron occurred in woody
districts, such as Surrey and Sussex, that it could be worked with
advantage. The occurrence of the termination <i>Hammer</i> in the name of
several villages in Surrey marks this old state of things. The railings
round St. Paul's Cathedral were regarded as the great achievement of the
southern ironworks. In 1740 means were discovered of working iron with
pit-coal, which at once opened an almost unbounded sphere for industry.
The discovery is attributed to Dr. John Roebuck of Birmingham, who, in
the year 1759, established the great Carron ironworks in Stirlingshire.
It is curious that a similar plan should have been regarded as one of
the bubbles of the South Sea year. Agriculture was still in a backward
condition, especially with regard to implements. The plough was still
a rude machine, chiefly of wood. Turnips were still crushed with the
beetle. Cultivators, and other means of assisting or saving the trouble
of ploughing, were unknown. But in the east of England, at all events,
the value of frequent manuring was understood;&mdash;turnips and other
root-crops had taken the place of fallow, and a limited rotation of crops
was in vogue. The use of the drill, although invented in 1732, was little
known. All these improvements were however gradually getting introduced,
as the waste lands or great common fields were by degrees enclosed.
Suffolk, where this had been early done, was at the head of agricultural
improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYONE_REFORM_OF_THE_CALAENDAR" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYONE_REFORM_OF_THE_CALAENDAR"></a>Reform of the Calendar. 1751.</div>

<p>During the period of parliamentary quiet which preceded Pelham's
death, two or three measures of permanent interest were passed. In 1751
the reform of the Calendar was proposed and carried triumphantly through
Parliament, chiefly by the exertions of Chesterfield, Lord Macclesfield,
and Bradley the astronomer. The Julian Calendar, in which the length of
year was slightly miscalculated, had been reformed by Pope Gregory XIII.
in 1582, and this reform had been gradually adopted in all countries in
Europe except England, Russia, and Sweden. England is said to have
rejected it from hatred of the Papacy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1015" id="Page_1015">[1015]</a></span>
effect was, that while the year in every other country began upon the 1st
of January, in England it began on the 25th of March; while, as compared
with other countries, there was a difference of eleven days in computing
the days of the month. The change proposed was, that the year 1752 should
begin upon the 1st of January, and that eleven days should be suppressed
between the 2nd and 14th of September, so that the third of that month
should be called the 14th, and that henceforward such changes should be
introduced as would make the solar and legal year coincident. The chief
practical difficulty was in the matter of payments. It was settled that
these should not be put forward. It is thus that the 5th of April, the
5th of July, the 10th of October, and the 5th of January, still remain
the days on which the dividends of the public funds are paid. This change
met with a good deal of ignorant opposition. The common Opposition
election cry was, "Give us back our eleven days."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYTHREE_LORD_HARADWICKES_MARRIAGE_ACT" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYTHREE_LORD_HARADWICKES_MARRIAGE_ACT"></a>Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act. 1753.</div>

<p>In 1753 a Marriage Act, usually known as Lord Hardwicke's Act, was
brought in, to decrease the number of the formal acts which constituted
a pre-engagement, in which a man might be entangled by carelessness and
against his own will, and, secondly, to check very rapid marriages. At
this time the facilities given to marriage enabled heirs and heiresses
to marry without consent of their natural guardians&mdash;a practice
still further supported by a quantity of broken and disreputable parsons
who hung about the Fleet Prison, and were known as Fleet Parsons, whose
performance of the ceremony was binding, and who could of course always
be procured for money. By the new Act marriages must be performed in
the parish church, after publication of banns, or by special licenses
granted by the Archbishop, and on payment of a heavy sum. Any clergyman
solemnizing a marriage in contravention of these restrictions is liable
to seven years' transportation. A Bill for the naturalization of
Jews, although carried, had to be repealed before the popular uproar.
The Bishops, who had supported the measure, drew upon themselves the
larger share of the popular indignation. They <span class="sidenote">Decay of the Church.</span>
were indeed at this time unusually liberal in their views. In the earlier
part of the reign Queen Caroline, in whose hands the appointments had
chiefly been, had carefully selected men of good repute and of liberal
tendencies; in opposition to the general feeling of the clergy, she
confined her appointments almost exclusively to Whigs. It is possible
that this conduct, however praiseworthy in itself, may have tended to
increase the general laxity among Churchmen and Dissenters,
which had already begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1016" id="Page_1016">[1016]</a></span>
be visible before the death of Bishop Burnet. Since that time a variety
of causes had combined to increase it. Thus, the separation of the
Church from the State in their political views, the Church being chiefly
Jacobite while the State was Whig; a similar division between the Bishops
and their clergy, and between the Universities, and the Government,
and the Bishops, all tended, by loosening the bonds of authority, to
the decay of the Church. The falling away of the Dissenters, and the
entire defeat of the Roman Catholics, had also removed all competition;
and while thus unnerved, the Church had been called upon to answer the
requirements of an increasing population and of growing towns. It had,
moreover, to combat the very general growth of that scepticism which was
so rife in France, and which was one of the remarkable symptoms of the
coming revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_THIRTY_RISE_OF_THE_WESLEYANS" id="SEVENTEEN_THIRTY_RISE_OF_THE_WESLEYANS"></a>Rise of the Wesleyans. 1730.</div>

<p>It was this state of public morality which induced the Wesleys to
begin their effort at a revival of religion, and to establish and
organize the great body of Wesleyan Methodists. They began their
career at Oxford, where they collected a small band of followers,
deeply impressed with the necessity of heartfelt religion. The most
prominent among them was Whitfield, who, after a youth passed in the
humble avocations of a waiter in the "Bell Inn" at Gloucester, was now
struggling to educate himself for the Church as a servitor at Pembroke
College. In his zeal for religion, Wesley went as a missionary to
Georgia. He met with no great success there; but on his return, in
1738, he found that his society had grown, and had reached even London.
Whitfield had been ordained, and had become renowned for his eloquence.
He it was who, while working at first among the colliers at Kingswood
near Bristol, introduced that field preaching which became the main
instrument in the spread of Methodism. It was some time before Wesley
could bring himself to adopt this custom; but it afterwards became his
constant practice. A separation soon occurred between Whitfield, who
was extreme in his views, and Wesley, who had separated himself from
the Moravians, with whom he had at first worked, but who in England at
least were guilty of many extravagances. The withdrawal of Whitfield
made Wesley undisputed chief of the new sect, and to him was left its
organization. His agents were for the most part energetic, half-educated
laymen, who all looked to Wesley as their absolute chief. His object was
not to separate from the Church, he himself said, "Our service is not
such as supersedes the Church service: we never designed it should;"
and only a very little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1017" id="Page_1017">[1017]</a></span>
before his death, he said, "I declare once more that I live and die a
member of the Church of England, and that none who regard my judgment
or advice will ever separate from it." What he tried to do was to bring
religion within the reach of those who, either by character or by the
line of life they pursued, were unlikely to be reached by the ordinary
apparatus of the Church, and to excite among his hearers a more true
and enthusiastic religion than the formalism at that time prevalent.
His society was to be not the enemy, but the handmaid of the Church.
Its organization was strict and admirable. The preachers moved on in
constant succession from district to district, so that neither preacher
nor hearer should grow weary of monotonous work. A conference, consisting
of preachers whom he selected, was held every year. The Methodists
were divided into classes, with a leader to each class, and a weekly
class-meeting was held. Love-feasts were also established, and any
grave sin was visited by exclusion from the society. The effect of this
earnest and well-arranged effort at reform was very great; not only on
the Methodists themselves, who were principally among the poorer classes,
especially miners and people out of reach of ordinary Church influences,
and who at his death in England and America numbered nearly 110,000,
but also on the Church, by exciting that warmth and emulation which we
have seen was at the time so much wanted. Although its influence was
thus great and excellent, it must not be concealed that, as was natural,
enthusiasm produced some eccentricities which will explain a good deal of
the opposition which Wesley undoubtedly met with among the higher classes
and among careless Churchmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nation asserts its opinion in opposition to
Parliament.</div>

<p>As in wealth and religion, so in its political tendencies, this
period was one of growth and of preparation for the more important half
century which was to follow. In that period was to begin the second
phase of the political change introduced at the Revolution:&mdash;the
gradual assertion by the nation of their right to proper representation
in Parliament. There were signs that the people at large were already
growing weary of the influence of a few great nobles, of the squabbles
of aristocratic parties for their own personal aggrandizement, and of
the secresy in which the conduct of their nominal representatives was
veiled. It is thus that the Opposition could generally rouse an almost
irresistible expression of feeling by appealing from the overwhelming
majority of Parliament to the passions of the nation. It was thus that
Pitt, regarded as a disinterested and patriotic man, without any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1018" id="Page_1018">[1018]</a></span>
usual sources of influence, became the most popular and powerful
statesman in the country; and thus when, in 1752, Mr. Murray charged with
interrupting the high bailiff at a Westminster election, refused to kneel
to the House, and was consequently imprisoned during the session, he was
led in triumphal procession by the sheriffs of London and Middlesex.
Indeed, the privileges claimed for the members of the House might alone
have sufficed to excite opposition. We hear that the very rabbits, fish,
and footmen of the members were taken under the august protection of the
House.</p>

<p>The term of the existing Parliament was just over, and it seemed
as if the same quiet course would be pursued in the following one,
when all such ideas were overthrown by the unexpected death of
Henry Pelham. His death broke the tie which connected so many

1754.</span> able men of varying opinions, and it became evident that
parliamentary and party struggles would again occur. The King is said
to have exclaimed, "Now I shall have no more peace." Upon the Duke
of Newcastle fell the task of attempting to continue the existing
Government. He himself took his brother's place at the head of the
Treasury; he appointed Henry Legge as his Chancellor of the Exchequer.
But it was not easy to supply Pelham's place as leader of the House of
Commons. The choice seemed to lie between Henry Fox, who was Secretary
at War, a friend and protégé of the Duke of Cumberland, Pitt, who was
Paymaster, and Murray, who was Attorney-General. Pitt, personally
disagreeable to the King, and moreover at this time in ill health, was
not to be thought of; Murray's ambition was confined to the law; the Duke
therefore applied to Fox. But they quarrelled about the arrangement of
patronage, of which Newcastle was very jealous; and ultimately Sir Thomas
Robinson, a man of no mark, was made Secretary, and given the management
of the House. Pitt and Fox combined to render his position ridiculous
and miserable. "The Duke might as well send his jackboot to lead us,"
said Pitt to Fox. Before the new Parliament had been assembled a month
it was found necessary to make terms with Fox, who was given a seat in
the Cabinet, although remaining in his subordinate place. This caused a
permanent estrangement between the two statesmen. With Fox's assistance
Newcastle got through the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approaching danger from India</div>

<p>But Newcastle was not the man to uphold a ministry during a
time of such difficulty as was evidently approaching.
Everything pointed to a speedy renewal of war. At the
Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the limits of our American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1019" id="Page_1019">[1019]</a></span>
colonies had been left undefined; while in India, where Dupleix and
Labourdonnais had inflicted heavy blows on the English during the
war, although the nations were at peace, the French and English
contrived to continue their rivalry by allying themselves with native
princes, and Clive had already rendered his name famous by
the defence of Arcot and the restoration of English power in the
<span class="sidenote">and America.</span> Carnatic.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Thus there were dangers both in the East and in the West. In America the
main object of the French was to secure the valley of the Mississippi,
to connect by this channel their Canadian colonies with those upon the
Gulf of Mexico, and thus to confine the English to the strip of country
between the Alleghany mountains and the sea. The English would thus be
constantly threatened on all sides, cut off from direct intercourse with
the Indians, and from all hope of any extension of their settlements
towards the west. The French began their encroachments by erecting
forts on the Ohio river, which were to secure the connection between
the Mississippi valley and Canada. A colonial war, in which the name of
Washington first becomes prominent, arose from these encroachments. And
this local warfare continued, till it became necessary for the Government
to take the matter up. A force under General Braddock was therefore
despatched against Fort Duquesne on the Ohio; but his careless stupidity
led him into an ambush, where he himself and a great number of his troops
were killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newcastle tries to confine the war to the
colonies.</div>

<p>In spite of these hostilities, and although the existence of unsettled
questions had caused a very uneasy feeling between them, France and
England were as yet nominally at peace. And Newcastle, wholly unfit to
conduct a great war, and eager to temporize as long as possible, seems
to have tried to confine the war to matters affecting the prosperity of
the American colonies. Thus Admiral Boscawen was sent out with orders
to watch the French fleet, and attack it if it appeared bound for the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. The consequence was an engagement, in which the
French lost two ships. The rest of the fleet, to the disappointment of
the English people, reached its destination. So again, Hawke's fleet in
the Channel received strange and contradictory orders. One party in the
Council wished to act openly and declare war. Newcastle suggested that
no orders should be given to Hawke, but that he should be sent out to
cruise, and that he should be ordered not to attack the French fleet
unless he thought it worth while. Finally, instructions were given him
to attack line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1020" id="Page_1020">[1020]</a></span>
battle ships, but nothing smaller, and to spare trading vessels. He had
not been gone a week when orders reached him to destroy everything large
and small between Cape Ortegal and Cape Clear. The consequence was a
large capture of prizes, and a not unfair outcry from France and the rest
of Europe against the strange conduct of the English in seizing vessels
without a declaration of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George's anxiety for Hanover.</div>

<p>It was plain that war could not much longer be delayed; and the King's
thoughts turned as usual to his continental dominions. Although the
importance of the crisis was universally felt, he was content to leave
England in the hands of a regency; and as soon as Parliament was over,
just before Boscawen sailed, he hurried to Hanover. Next to France, the
object of George's dread was Prussia. More than one cause of quarrel had
arisen with that country. Frederick had refused to assist in securing
the election of the Archduke Joseph (afterwards Joseph II.) as King of
the Romans, a project which Newcastle and George had deeply at heart,
believing that it would preserve the European balance and strengthen
Austria against the French. Deprived of Frederick's assistance, the plan
came to nothing. In 1753, again, a dispute had arisen about some ships
captured in the late war, and condemned, as Frederick asserted, unjustly
by the English Admiralty courts. To such an extent had the irritation
against Prussia increased, that it <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYFIVE_HIS_SUBSIDIARY_TREATIES" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYFIVE_HIS_SUBSIDIARY_TREATIES"></a>He makes
subsidiary treaties against Prussia. 1755.</span> was confidently
believed that Frederick intended to assist the Pretender in another
attack upon England, taking advantage of the disturbance to secure
Hanover for himself. Against Prussia, therefore, George began contracting
great subsidiary treaties with the continental princes. The most
important of these were with Hesse and with the Czarina of Russia. A
factory, says Horace Walpole, was opened at Herrnhausen, where every
prince that could muster and clothe a regiment might traffic with it to
advantage.</p>

<p>It became Newcastle's duty to carry these contracts through
Parliament. He knew the opposition they were certain to meet
<span class="sidenote">They are opposed by Pitt.</span> with, and the
necessity of finding some strong support in the Lower House; but his
Cabinet was there represented by no man of mark. He had recourse to Pitt,
who held the office of Paymaster, but he positively refused to support
the subsidies. His colleague Legge went further, and refused to sign the
warrants which were to open the Treasury. Newcastle had then recourse to
Fox, and succeeded in securing his services by removing Robinson,
and making Fox Secretary of State. But the introduction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1021" id="Page_1021">[1021]</a></span>
address at the opening of Parliament in the autumn, when the Russian and
Hessian subsidies were recommended, was the signal for an open mutiny in
the ministerial camp. It was attacked in vehement words by Pitt, who, in
a well-known passage, likened the new coalition to the junction he had
once seen of the Rhone and the Saône; the one a gentle, feeble, languid
stream of no depth, and the other a boisterous, impetuous torrent.
Newcastle had no alternative but to discharge both Pitt and Legge from
their offices.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_FRENCH_CAPTURE_MINORCA" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_FRENCH_CAPTURE_MINORCA"></a>The French capture Minorca. May 1756.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the courage of the nation had sunk very low. There was a
dread of an immediate French invasion; and the Government so thoroughly
lost heart as to request the King to garrison England with Hanoverian
troops. This dread was kept alive by a simulated collection of French
troops in the north. But, under cover of this threat, a fleet was being
collected at Toulon, with the real design of capturing Minorca. The
ministry were at last roused to this danger, and Byng was despatched
with ten sail of the line to prevent it. Three days after he set sail
the Duke de Richelieu, with 16,000 men, slipped across into the island,
and compelled General Blakeney, who was somewhat old and infirm, to
withdraw into the castle of St. Philip, which was at once besieged.
On the 19th of May&mdash;much too late to prevent the landing of
Richelieu&mdash;Byng arrived within view of St. Philip, which was still
in the possession of the English. The French Admiral, La Galissonnière,
sailed out to cover the siege, and Byng, who apparently felt himself
unequally matched&mdash;although West, his second in command, behaved
with gallantry and success&mdash;called a council of war, and withdrew.
Blakeney, who had defended his position with great bravery, had to
surrender.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newcastle resigns. Nov. 1756.</div>

<p>The failure of Byng, and the general weakness and incapacity of
the ministry, roused the temper of the people to rage; and Newcastle,
trembling for himself, threw all the blame upon the Admiral, hoping by
this means to satisfy the popular cry. But Fox, his chief supporter, was
in no mood to risk anything by fidelity to so weak a chief. He therefore
resigned the Seals; and as Murray insisted upon either resigning or being
made Lord Chief Justice (which office was given him), Newcastle, without
support in the Commons, found himself obliged to resign also.</p>

<p>It was hoped that Fox and Pitt might come in together, but their
quarrel was irreconcilable. After some negotiations, therefore, the
Duke of Devonshire was made First Lord of the Treasury, and Pitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1022" id="Page_1022">[1022]</a></span>
First Secretary of State and real Prime Minister. The measures
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_PITTS_VIGOROUS_GOVERNMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_PITTS_VIGOROUS_GOVERNMENT"></a>Pitt's vigorous government. 1757.</span> of the
new Government were in strict accordance with the principles of the
party which Pitt represented. The Hessians were dismissed, a Bill was
passed for increasing the militia, by which 32,000 men were to be called
out; reinforcements were sent to America; the enterprising and warlike
character of the Highlanders was enlisted on the side of order by the
formation of Highland regiments, a step which did more towards the
pacification of the country than any measures of coercion. Pitt also did
what he could to dissociate himself from the conduct of Newcastle with
regard to Admiral Byng. A court martial held upon that officer had been
bound by strict instructions, and had found itself obliged to bring in a
verdict of guilty, though without casting any imputation on the personal
courage of the Admiral. On his accession to power Pitt was courageous
enough, although he rested on the popular favour, to do his best to get
Byng pardoned, and urged on the King that the House of Commons seemed
to wish the sentence to be mitigated. The King is said to have answered
in words that fairly describe Pitt's position, "Sir, you have taught me
to look for the sense of my subjects in another place than the House
of Commons." The sentence was carried out, and Byng was shot on the
quarter-deck of the 'Monarque' at Portsmouth (March 14, 1757). But the
new ministry was of short duration. Pitt found himself unable to stand
up against the dislike of the King, and the want of that Parliamentary
influence which Newcastle's position as head of the Whigs, and his long
course of corruption, had gained him. He was summarily dismissed. The
King tried to get back Newcastle and his subservient ministry (whom
he used to speak of as "Newcastle's footmen"), and, after a period of
intrigue, Pitt had to consent to a compromise, giving his own talents and
popularity, and accepting in exchange the great Parliamentary support of
Newcastle. To this ministry Fox was persuaded to give his adhesion, and
to accept the lucrative post of Paymaster-General. Thus was formed that
strong Government so gloriously known as Pitt's ministry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret treaties of Maria Theresa.</div>

<p>While these ministerial changes had been going on in England,
our dispute with France as to the limits of our American colonies
had become blended with a quarrel of quite a different
origin, which was to plunge Europe into a general
war for several years. As early as 1745, before the signature
of the Treaty of Dresden, the Courts of Berlin and Dresden
had entered into some sort of arrangement for curtailing what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1023" id="Page_1023">[1023]</a></span>
regarded as the undue pre-eminence of Prussia. After that treaty
the Empress Queen seems to have been still more anxious for some
similar plan, and almost immediately after the termination of the
War of Succession, had entered into relations with the Czarina
Elizabeth of Russia; a treaty had been agreed to, to which there
were added secret clauses, providing that any movement on the
part of Prussia against either Russia, Austria, or Poland, should be
held wholly to invalidate the Treaty of Dresden; and in the result
of a success of their arms, it was arranged that Prussia should be
divided between the three countries. These arrangements are sometimes
spoken of as the Treaties of Warsaw and of St. Petersburg. To
this treaty the Elector of Saxony, who was also King of Poland, was a
party, though without signing. In 1754, magazines and armies were
prepared in Bohemia and Moravia; the Saxon army was collected at
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYFOUR_EUROPE_PREPARES_FOR_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYFOUR_EUROPE_PREPARES_FOR_WAR"></a>Europe prepares for war.</span> Pirna; and
finally, in 1756, adroit flattery addressed to Madame de Pampadour, the
reigning mistress at the French Court, induced France to join in the
alliance. Louis and his ministry, ignoring the really vital question
which was then at issue with England, reversed the traditional policy
of France, rejected the proffered alliance with Prussia, and threw the
country headlong into a European war, in close alliance with its old
enemy the Austrian House.</p>

<p><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_SEVEN_YEARS_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_SEVEN_YEARS_WAR"></a>In accordance with the traditions of European policy it was England,
not France, who should have appeared as the ally of Austria. But
a coldness had been gradually springing up between the Courts.
The Barrier Treaty of Utrecht, by which the Austrian Netherlands
<span class="sidenote">Alliance between England and Prussia.</span>
were debarred from the Indian trade, was a constant cause of uneasiness.
The part which England had taken in mediating the Treaties of Breslau
and Dresden, which ceded Silesia to Prussia, had been mistaken by
the Austrian Court; although in fact both wise and friendly, it had
excited deep displeasure. Thus, when an alliance was mentioned, the
terms proposed by Austria were so high that the English Government had
no choice but to refuse them. Under these circumstances, as Hanover
could not be left exposed wholly without friends, England turned to the
opposite party and allied itself with Prussia.</p>

<p>Frederick had already entered upon the war. The appearance of
hostile preparations had aroused his suspicions. He demanded a
plain answer as to the intentions of the Empress Queen, and on
<span class="sidenote">Frederick's first campaign.</span>
receiving an evasive reply, he determined upon striking
the first blow, although he knew that his nation numbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1024" id="Page_1024">[1024]</a></span>
but 5,000,000, while the number of the allies could not be estimated
at less than 90,000,000. He passed rapidly through Saxony, blockaded
the Saxon army in Pirna, and, collecting all his forces, defeated the
Austrians under Marshal Braun at Lowositz (Oct. 1, 1756). After this
victory he rendered the relief of the Saxons impossible, and the whole
army surrendered at Pirna. Frederick occupied Dresden, and there found
and published copies of the secret treaties, which fully justified
his conduct. The French had made a false step in plunging into the
continental war. They were already successful in the Mediterranean;
already the overbearing conduct of the English, in laying a nominal
blockade on all the ports of France, had excited the general indignation
of the Continent. The real policy of that country was to direct all their
energies to the colonial and maritime war with England. It is probable
that they thought to wring from George concessions in the colonies in
exchange for the security of Hanover, which lay exactly between the
contending parties. But Pitt at once apprehended the error they had made,
and saw a great opportunity for raising the power of England. He knew
that when France was busied in the endless difficulties of the European
war, England, while subsidizing foreign troops, could employ her real
power in completing her <span class="sidenote">Supported by Pitt.</span>
colonial empire. He therefore braved the charge of inconsistency, and
threw himself heart and soul into the defence of Hanover and the support
of Frederick. To understand how complete his apparent change of views
was, and his courage in openly avowing them, the principles of the
party which he had hitherto represented must be remembered. Though a
section of the great Whig party, they differed in their views both as to
foreign and domestic policy from the main body of the Whigs. To both the
power of France was an object of dread. But,&mdash;while the official
Whigs desired to check it by the preservation of the balance of power
in Europe, by close connection with the continental powers, by money
subsidies, and by occasional assistance of troops,&mdash;Pitt
<span class="sidenote">Foreign policy of the various parties in
England.</span> and his friends thought that, as England was an island,
its natural policy was to depend upon the navy; that as trade was our
proper business, so the navy was our proper strength; that we did but
weaken ourselves by entangling ourselves with foreign politics; that
our army should be entirely defensive, and that we need have no fear of
invasion while we commanded the sea. Thus while one party upheld the
necessity of subsidies and a considerable standing army, the other wished
for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1025" id="Page_1025">[1025]</a></span>
subsidies, a strong militia, and a powerful navy. The differences were
not less in their respective views of home policy. The main body of
the Whigs were desirous of retaining quite unchanged the Constitution
as settled by the Revolution, and held that power must be secured
by parliamentary influence and the distribution of patronage. In
Pitt's more liberal view, parliamentary influence should have been
unnecessary&mdash;a Government pleasing to the people, which a good
Government would naturally be, would want no other support. Pitt's
alliance with Newcastle and his acceptance of his parliamentary influence
was as entirely opposed to this view as his maintenance of subsidies to
the European powers was to all appearance opposed to his former views of
foreign politics. But circumstances had arisen which to his mind entirely
altered the position of England, and he frankly declared that it was for
the sake of England that Hanover was threatened, and that he would win
America for them in Germany.</p>

<p>The object Pitt set before him in his new ministry was to raise
the national spirit. For this purpose he threw himself with all
his vehemence into the war, and his energy became visible in every
department. He at once assumed the whole conduct of foreign affairs,
leaving to Newcastle the jobbery he so much liked; it is even said <span
class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_DISASTERS_OF_THE_YEAR" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_DISASTERS_OF_THE_YEAR"></a>Disasters of the year 1757.</span> that the Admiralty
had orders to sign his despatches and instructions without reading them.
But he was met with difficulties arising from the bad Government and the
bad appointments which he found on entering office. It was thus, with
wholly inefficient generals, that he set to work to do what he could in
the year 1757. True to his general view of employing England chiefly
on the sea, it was to expeditions to the French coast that he at first
looked for success. Before he was well seated in the ministry such an
expedition had been despatched against Rochefort under Admiral Hawke
and General Mordaunt. The fleet acted well enough, but Mordaunt and his
soldiers brought the expedition to ruin, though Wolfe volunteered to
capture the town if he might be intrusted with 500 men. In America the
same want of success met the English. Lord Loudon was there commanding
in chief, a man who was incessantly busy and never did anything; he was
graphically described by Franklin as resembling a St. George and the
dragon on the sign of an inn, always mounted on a galloping horse, but
never advancing a step. Under such leadership the attack on Louisburg
failed. Worse than this was the disaster which attended our troops
in Germany. The Duke of Cumberland, bold and active,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">[1026]</a></span>
but no general, allowed himself to be outman&oelig;uvred by Marshal
D'Estrées, suffered the French to cross the Weser unopposed, was beaten
at Hastenbach, and while attempting to cover the fortress of Stade,
was surrounded by the French and compelled to sign the Convention of
Klosterseven, by which it was agreed that his army should be entirely
broken up, the auxiliaries sent to their homes, and the Hanoverian troops
go into cantonments. To complete the misery of the situation, Frederick
had himself suffered a disastrous defeat at Kolin, in Bohemia, while
covering the siege of Prague. The extraordinary campaign which saved
Prussia does not belong to our history; it is enough to understand, that
with extreme rapidity he threw himself towards the western extremity of
his widespread dominions, and filled the gap which Cumberland had left
open. The great victory of Rosbach, in the neighbourhood of the Saale,
over the French and Imperialists, rendered that flank secure for the
present. Suddenly darting back again into Silesia, where his affairs had
not been going prosperously in his absence, he completely defeated the
Austrians at the battle of Lissa, north of the river Schneidwitz, and
thus rendered that flank secure also.</p>

<p>This year, so disastrous in Europe, had been marked by the signal
success of our arms in India, whither Clive, who had come home after his
brilliant successes in the Carnatic, had again returned as Governor of
Fort St. David. He had been summoned to Bengal to revenge the horrors of
the Black Hole of Calcutta, and had there laid the foundation of the
English power by the brilliant victory of Plassy.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYEIGHT_CHANGE_OF_GENERALS" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYEIGHT_CHANGE_OF_GENERALS"></a>Change of generals. 1758.</div>

<p>The disasters which had met the English arms in all directions moved
the anger of Pitt, and he determined on a thorough change of generals.
In the place of Cumberland, who had shown his inefficiency in the last
campaign, Ferdinand of Brunswick, a worthy disciple of Frederick's,
was appointed to command the army of Hanover; and as the Convention of
Klosterseven was repudiated by the English, he found the defeated army at
Stade ready to receive him. Loudon gave place to Amherst and Wolfe. It
was in America that the English troops were chiefly employed. The mouth
of the St. Lawrence was guarded by Cape Breton Island and Louisburg.
At New York the Hudson falls into <span class="sidenote">Success in
America.</span> the sea, and from its mouth there runs northward, nearly
into the valley of the St. Lawrence, a valley and chain of lakes, of
which the first is Lake Champlain. The fortress which holds the road is
Ticonderoga. On the Ohio, as already mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[1027]</a></span>
was Fort Duquesne, where Fort Pittsburg now is. The French possessions
were to be attacked by each of these three points. Amherst and Wolfe,
with a fleet under Boscawen, were to capture Louisburg. Abercrombie was
to push up the Hudson and take Ticonderoga, while to Forbes was intrusted
the capture of Fort Duquesne. Working hand in hand, without jealousy,
Amherst and Boscawen succeeded at once in capturing Louisburg, which
had last year been supposed unassailable. Fort Duquesne was also taken.
Ticonderoga, strong from its situation in the midst of water and marshes,
resisted all efforts, but the line of junction between Canada and the
Mississippi was effectually cut.</p>

<p>In Europe the same energy was visible. The army of Ferdinand was
reinforced by a considerable number of English troops. Prince Ferdinand
was opposed by the Count of Clermont, an unusually incapable general,
who had in fact never before seen troops in the field. He succeeded in
clearing Hanover and driving the French behind the Rhine at Creveld. He
there <span class="sidenote">Victory of Creveld. June 23, 1758.</span>
defeated them with a loss of some 6000 men, but found himself unable to
retain his advanced position, and recrossed the river. Pitt had often
asserted that, much as he wished to uphold the cause of Frederick,
nothing would induce him to send British blood to "the Elbe, to be
lost in that ocean of gore." But this successful campaign induced him
to change his view, and a considerable body of troops, about 12,000 in
number, under the Duke of Marlborough and Lord George Sackville, were
sent to join Prince Ferdinand. These same officers had just been employed
in executing one of those joint military and naval expeditions which Pitt
seems at first to have thought the proper means by which England should
assist in a continental war. Like all such isolated expeditions, it was
of little value. St. Malo, against which it was directed,
<span class="sidenote">Expeditions to Cherbourg and St. Malo.</span>
was found too strong to be taken, but a large quantity of shipping and
naval stores was destroyed. The fleet also approached Cherbourg, but
although the troops were actually in their boats ready to land, they were
ordered to re-embark, and the fleet came home. Another somewhat similar
expedition was sent out later in the year. In July General Bligh and
Commodore Howe took and destroyed Cherbourg, but on attempting a similar
assault on St. Malo, they found it too strong for them. The army had been
landed in the Bay of St. Cast, and, while engaged in re-embarkation,
it was attacked by some French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[1028]</a></span>
troops which had been hastily collected, and severely handled. In
spite of this slight check it was plain that the tide of victory had
<span class="sidenote">Campaign of Frederick.</span> changed. The
campaign of King Frederick had been marked by chequered fortune. He had
found the siege of Olmutz, in Moravia, beyond his strength, but upon the
east of his dominions had won a great victory over the Russians, under
General Fermor, at Zörndorf (August 25); and though he suffered a heavy
defeat by a night surprise at Hofkirchen, he managed his retreat so ably,
that before the end of the year he had rid Saxony of the Austrians and
again secured Silesia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYNINE_NAVAL_VICTORIES_OF_LAGOS" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYNINE_NAVAL_VICTORIES_OF_LAGOS"></a>Victories of the year 1759.</div>

<p>The success which had marked the course of the British arms in all
parts of the world continued to attend them, and this year (1759) is one
of the most glorious in our military annals. Horace Walpole remarks, that
"it was necessary to ask every morning what new victory there was for
fear of missing one." In January came the news of the capture of Goree in
Africa, in June the news of the capture of Guadaloupe, in August of the
victory of Minden, in September of Lagos, in October of Quebec, and in
November of Quiberon. The contrast between the England of 1757, crouching
in fear within its own limits and crying for help to Hanover and Hesse,
and the England of 1759 is indeed striking. There was again a threatened
descent of the French upon England, but there was now no craven fear of
such an event. Pitt had raised the temper of the people. The threat was
regarded not only with indifference, but as a means of acquiring further
triumph. England could well defend itself. The militia was called out
and mobilized; the fleet was so large and in such order that it could
efficiently watch all the French ports. Boats for the expedition were
building at Havre; Rodney anchored in the harbour and bombarded it for
fifty hours, destroying most of the boats; Boscawen was watching De la
Clue at Toulon; Hawke was watching Conflans at Brest. Thurot, in Dunkirk,
was also blockaded. This arrangement of fleets produced in the course of
the year two great naval victories.</p>

<p>The French desired to connect their scattered squadrons. For this
purpose De la Clue attempted to come out of Toulon and to join the
fleets in the north of France. As he passed round Spain, Boscawen,
<span class="sidenote">Naval victories of Lagos and Quiberon.</span>
whose duty it had been to watch him, fell upon his fleet off Lagos. Three
of his ships were taken and two destroyed, while eight vessels, which had
been separated from him, were lost as they came through the straits; so
that, with the exception of two ships, the whole of his squadron was annihilated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[1029]</a></span>
This was in September. In the following month a still greater success
met the English navy. Sir Edward Hawke attacked the Brest fleet under
Conflans off the point of Quiberon. He had been driven from his watch by
stress of weather, and Conflans had taken the opportunity to come out of
harbour, hoping to destroy a detached squadron which was off the coast.
But Hawke's return was too quick for him. He made a junction with the
detached squadron, and thus, superior in force to the French, drove them
back towards the coast. The French withdrew among the rocky islets near
the mouth of the Vilaine. It was blowing a gale, and the rocky coast was
full of danger. But Hawke replied to the representations of his pilot by
giving him peremptory orders, that whatever the risk might be, he was
to lay his ship alongside of the French admiral's. "You have done your
duty in showing me the danger, now you are to obey my orders and lay me
alongside the Soleil Royal." The victory was complete: two French ships
struck, four were sunk, and the rest, all damaged, ran for shelter to the
Vilaine. This blow, together with the complete destruction of Thurot's
squadron, which had come out of Dunkirk and made a landing in Ireland,
completed the practical annihilation of the French fleet. The total loss
up to this time of the French navy was sixty-four ships, without counting
Thurot's squadron. During the same time the English had lost but nine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of Quebec.</div>

<p>But the great victory of the year was the capture of Quebec. To secure
Canada was one of Pitt's chief objects. Louisburg and Duquesne had
already fallen, and the country itself was thus open to his attack. The
French army was under the command of an excellent general, the Marquis
de Montcalm, who had his headquarters at Quebec. General Amherst was
the English commander-in-chief, but subordinates of more than usual
vigour were necessary for him, and Pitt, who had kept his eye on Wolfe
since the attack on Rochefort, and had seen his energy at the siege of
Louisburg, disregarding all claims of seniority, intrusted to him the
attack on Quebec. This was originally to be a combined movement. Amherst
was to march up by Lakes Champlain and George, take Ticonderoga and Crown
Point, where Abercrombie had failed last year, and thus reach the St.
Lawrence. Generals Prideaux and Johnson were to take Fort Niagara, and
then, passing down Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence, to join in the
attack on Quebec, securing Montreal on the way. Though both these latter
expeditions were successful, the difficulties met with rendered them
so slow that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">[1030]</a></span>
combination failed. The plan was Pitt's own, and was probably too
extensive; it may be doubted whether he had sufficient knowledge of
what it is possible for an army to do. Wolfe, with 8000 men, embarked
in the squadron of Admiral Saunders, and reached the Isle of Orleans in
the St. Lawrence river on the 13th of June. The expedition experienced
no disasters in the way, having fortunately captured a vessel with some
excellent charts of the river.</p>

<p>Quebec lies on and below the rocky edge of a plateau on the left or
northern bank of the St. Lawrence, just above the junction of the St.
Charles river, which thus covers its eastern side. On the other side of
the St. Charles the ground again rises and continues in a rugged and
difficult mass, till it sinks where the river Montmorency falls into the
St. Lawrence in a lofty waterfall. The ridge between the Montmorency
and the St. Charles is called Beauport. On this Montcalm's army was in
position, precluding the possibility of investing Quebec, to which he had
access by a bridge across the St. Charles. On the other or Quebec side
of the St. Charles, the heights on the edge of which the town is built
extend up the St. Lawrence, and are called the Heights of Abraham. They
were believed to be inaccessible to an army. The Isle of Orleans lies in
the St. Lawrence from the mouth of the Montmorency till almost opposite
Quebec harbour. As long as Montcalm's army occupied the line of Beauport
Quebec could not be invested. In that position the army was unassailable.
To draw him from it therefore was Wolfe's great object. For this purpose
frequent feints were made, but were all unavailing. One assault indeed
near the mouth of the Montmorency was attempted, but the English were
beaten off. Nor were the defenders of the town idle; again and again were
fire-ships sent down, but the skilful vigilance of Saunders rendered all
such efforts unavailing. A battery or two were erected and the town was
bombarded, but this did little or no good. It seemed plain that from the
Isle of Orleans nothing could be done. The army was moved in succession
to two points higher up the river and above Quebec. But Montcalm would
not move; he was content to send an army of observation up the river,
and the besiegers lost all hope of the succours they had expected from
Amherst and Johnson. On the 9th of September, Wolfe wrote a despatch
in which he seemed quite to despair of success. Within a week Quebec
was taken. The bold design occurred to him of surprising the Heights of
Abraham, and thus compelling Montcalm to fight. He ordered feints to be
made both up and down the river while he quietly collected boats.
As it was, they were so few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">[1031]</a></span>
number that his army had to cross in two divisions. Very early in the
morning of the 13th of September he began his attempt. With immense toil,
up a passage so narrow that at times only one could pass, his soldiers
forced their way, and even dragged up one piece of artillery, and when
the morning came Montcalm found between three and four thousand men
in position opposite to him upon the heights. To cover Quebec it was
necessary for him to withdraw his troops from Beauport and to cross the
St. Charles. This he at once proceeded to do, and the battle began. Early
in the day Wolfe, who was on the right wing, was wounded and carried to
the rear, but before he died he had the gratification of knowing that the
victory was secured. Both armies lost their first and second in command.
Five days afterwards Quebec was surrendered. Wolfe was but thirty-three
when he died; he entered the army at fourteen, and had seen much service;
a shy, retiring, domestic man, of unprepossessing exterior and weak
frame, he owed his promotion entirely to the feeling of confidence which
his sound sense and chivalrous energy inspired. It is much to the credit
of Pitt that he should have found out his merits, and having found them
out have ventured to place so great a responsibility upon so young and
unprepossessing a person.</p>

<p>While all the efforts in which the English were engaged singlehanded
had thus been successfully carried out, they had also, in conjunction
<span class="sidenote">Victory of Minden.</span> with their German
allies, won on the 1st of August the great battle of Minden. The French
had early in the year taken possession of Frankfort. Their army, strongly
reinforced&mdash;for the new ministry of the Duc de Choiseul began by
being very energetic,&mdash;was divided into two; the northern corps
under Marshal Contades, the southern army about Frankfort under De
Broglie. An attempt of Ferdinand to regain Frankfort was frustrated by De
Broglie, who beat him at the battle of Bergen. The two French armies then
joined, and pressed upon the Prince till they drove him behind Minden,
a town on the left or French side of the river Weser. It became clear
to Ferdinand that a battle must be fought to save Hanover. He therefore
advanced southwards up the Weser, carefully keeping his communications
with that river open, while the object of the French seems to have been
chiefly to separate him from it. By spreading his army so as to give it
the appearance of weakness, though it was in reality capable of rapid
concentration, he induced the French to leave an extremely strong position
they had taken up upon Minden Heath, with their right covered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1032" id="Page_1032">[1032]</a></span>
the town, which was in their possession. A body of troops, apparently
detached, upon the extreme left of the allies, and close to the Weser,
was the bait by which the French were attracted. They hoped by destroying
this ill-supported detachment to cut the Prince off from the river. But
as De Broglie approached what he believed to be the weak point, he was
surprised to find the whole allied army in array before him. Ferdinand by
this clever trap brought his enemy to an engagement upon his own ground.
The battle consisted in great part of a series of charges of French
cavalry on compact bodies of the English and Hanoverian infantry. Weary
with their futile exertions, the cavalry, who formed the centre of the
French line, gave way. The line was broken, and a charge of cavalry alone
was wanted to complete the destruction of the army. Three aide-de-camps
were sent in succession to Lord George Sackville, bidding him charge.
He pretended not to understand the order, and said he must consult the
Prince in person. The same order was given to the Marquis of Granby,
who commanded in the second line, and a vigorous charge made, but time
had been wasted, and it was too late. The victory was however rendered
tolerably complete by a body of 10,000 men, whom Prince Ferdinand had
had the courage and foresight to detach from his army, although he was
already numerically weaker than his enemy, for the purpose of cutting the
enemy's communications. Lord George Sackville was tried by court martial
and dismissed from all his military appointments.</p>

<p>The story of the British victories of the year is completed by the
success of their arms in India, where the siege of Madras was raised,
much of the Carnatic secured, and Wandewash taken by Colonel Coote.</p>

<p>It is necessary to say a few words about the war carried on under
Frederick's own eye. The plan of the campaign was much the same
as the last. The Russians advanced to gain the Oder, and fought
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTY_FREDERICKS_CAMPAIGN" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTY_FREDERICKS_CAMPAIGN"></a>Frederick's fourth campaign.</span> and won the
battle of Zullichau over General Wedel, after which they were joined
by an Austrian army under Loudon. Against this united force the King
advanced, leaving Daun's army already threatening Berlin. He met Saltikow
and Loudon at Kunersdorf. The Russian position was forced, seventy
cannon taken, and the victory appeared complete, when suddenly Loudon
advanced with his troops and altered the fate of the day. In these two
last battles the Prussian forces had been weakened by 30,000 men, and the
King, feeling certain that he was at the end of his resources, made
every arrangement for committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1033" id="Page_1033">[1033]</a></span>
suicide. Unaccountably the enemy did not advance, and he had time to
collect a few troops. But fortune was still against him; his general,
Fink, with 12,000 men, was surrounded, and had to surrender at Maxen;
Dresden had fallen into the hands of Daun. After this reinforcements
from the army of Prince Ferdinand enabled the King to continue the
campaign, till the extreme cold of winter made it necessary to go into
winter quarters. The following year Frederick still made head against his
gathering enemies. He was unable indeed to save Berlin from the hands of
the Russians, but he rescued Silesia by the victory which he gained over
Loudon <span class="sidenote">Battle of Torgau. 1760.</span> at Liegnitz,
and at his approach the Russians fled from his capital. He then turned
his arms against Daun, who was still master of Saxony. The fearful battle
of Torgau was fought, where the victory was secured to the Prussians, but
at the cost of 14,000 men; the Austrians are said to have lost 20,000.
This was the last pitched battle of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pre-eminence of Pitt.</div>

<p>The constant success of his schemes raised Pitt to the highest
eminence of power. His ministry was unopposed. Year by year he was
enabled, without difficulty, to carry through the House a subsidy of
£670,000 to the Prussian King, and to set his estimates at from twelve
to twenty millions, a sum before this unheard of. His power over the
House was absolute; members were actually afraid of replying to him, and
the only difficulty which met him was the temper of his relative Temple,
who insisted upon receiving the Garter, and almost shipwrecked the
ministry by <span class="sidenote">The King dies. Oct. 25, 1760.</span>
his selfish claims. It was at this moment of prosperity that the King
suddenly died, and, as had long been expected, a change took place in the
counsels of the Sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="first drop">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the 25th of October news was brought to the Prince of Wales that
his grandfather was dead. It was an event which must have been for some
time expected, and George III. and his friends were prepared for it.
His training had been somewhat peculiar. <span class="sidenote">Bute's
influence over the young King. 1760.</span> The Princess of Wales, his
mother, had kept him much secluded, and his education had been chiefly
withdrawn from the hands of the distinguished men whom the King had given
him as governors, and intrusted to sub-preceptors of the Princess's
own choosing. Her constant friend and adviser in this and other family
matters had been Lord Bute, who had thereby acquired the greatest
influence over the young King. It was understood that henceforth his
advice would chiefly regulate the policy of the Crown. His influence
and that of the teachers he had selected, some of them it is believed
nominated by Bolingbroke, had all tended politically in one direction, so
much so that complaints had been made, though uselessly, to the late King
of the unconstitutional precepts which his heir was being taught. The
views with which the young Prince's mind was filled were those which Bolingbroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1036" id="Page_1036">[1036]</a></span>
had developed in "The Patriot King." The beneficent rule of a powerful
monarch governing his people by his own will, but for their good, was
the ideal he had been taught to set before him. It was pointed out to
him that since 1688 the will of the sovereign had been held captive by
that great Whig party which had produced the Revolution and secured the
Hanoverian succession. And it had been impressed upon him that it was
his duty to free the prerogative from this state of servitude, and to
annihilate party government by restoring to the Crown its freedom of
choice and action. It was with the deliberate intention of carrying out
this plan that the King began his reign. Nor was the plan, had it been
properly executed, either impossible or unjust. It was felt that the old
party divisions were in fact obsolete, that Whig and Tory, in the sense
of Hanoverian <span class="sidenote">George's view of royalty.</span> and
Jacobite, were things of the past; and that it was highly detrimental
to the public service that able and loyal men should be excluded from
all share of the Government because, very frequently on only hereditary
grounds, they belonged to a party opposed to the great Whig connection.
Yet such had been the case. Parliamentary contests had, till Pitt's
accession to power, been nothing but greedy struggles for place and power
between two sections of the Whig party which had separated in 1716. Had
the King made use of his present popularity, and of that advantage which
he possessed over his predecessors in his English birth, to exercise
his prerogative of choice in selecting eminent men from all parties for
his ministry, and had he taken for his chief minister a man who stood
well with the nation, the feeling of the country would almost certainly
have gone with him. Unfortunately his somewhat narrow intellect and his
restricted education made him unable to take a wide view of his position,
filled him with a vehement prejudice against the whole Whig party, and
made him rest for support on the personal friendship of a second-rate
man, who laboured under the unpopularity attending his Scotch birth and
his supposed favour with the Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the young King was at first all that could be
desired. In his family relations indeed he was nearly always
respectable. He still further added to his popularity by directing a
change in the law with regard to the judges, so that their commissions
no longer terminated with the death of the King. They henceforward
held their commissions for life, unless deprived of them at the

rendered absolutely independent of Court favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYONE_SIGNS__OF_A_CHANGE" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYONE_SIGNS__OF_A_CHANGE"></a>First signs of change. 1761.</div>

<p>The six months which elapsed before the dissolution of Parliament
passed without any great changes, although there was no lack of
indication of what was coming. The King's name was constantly put
forward. Newcastle, who had kept all patronage in his hands, found places
filled without his knowledge, and complained that he was met with the
uniform answer that it was the King's desire; and Bute openly rebuked
Lord Anson for filling the Admiralty boroughs without consulting the
King. With the dissolution of Parliament the changes in the ministry
began. Legge gave place at the Exchequer to Lord Barrington; Charles
Townshend became Secretary at War, and Dashwood, another follower of
Bute's, took the place that Townshend vacated, while four days afterwards
(March 25th) Bute was appointed one of the Secretaries of State in
the place of Lord Holderness, who had been removed and handsomely
compensated. The admission of Bute to the ministry could hardly fail to
produce the dismissal of Pitt, for on the great question of the day they
were in direct antagonism. Bute, in pursuance of his policy of opposition
to all that the Whigs had done, was determined if possible to break
off the English connection with the Continent; and, unable to see the
difference between buying troops from a Prince of Hesse and assisting
the greatest monarch of the time in a war from which England was reaping
nothing but benefit, he intended to refuse the payment of the King of
Prussia's subsidy, and was strongly bent upon peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The campaign of 1761 produces a desire for
peace.</div>

<p>Frederick's own campaign of 1760 had closed, as has been already said,
with the dreadful battle of Torgau, and the same year Prince Ferdinand
had held the French in check, worsting them at Warburg, but had been
unable to keep them out of Göttingen and Cassel; and the hereditary
Prince of Brunswick, detached to the siege of Wesel, had been defeated
at Kloster-Campen. In 1761 the campaign was continued, and the Duke of
Broglie was driven back to the Maine and beaten at Langen-Saltza. But
Prince Ferdinand was not strong enough to keep what he had regained.
The French again advanced, and in June the Prince of Soubise joined the
Duke de Broglie, and they together moved forward to the Lippe. They were
defeated at Kirch-Denkern, but the effect of the victory was small, and
both armies closed the year in much the same position as they began it.
These campaigns, resulting in little but loss of life, and the exertions
which they entailed, and which had brought France to the verge of
bankruptcy, had become intolerable; and early in the year De Choiseul had induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">[1038]</a></span>
both Austria and Russia to consent to negotiations at Augsburg.
But as the connection of England with the continental question was
accidental, and her quarrel with France quite separate from it, it
was thought expedient that a separate arrangement should be made
between the two countries. For this purpose M. de Bussy was in
June sent to England and Mr. Hans Stanley to Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Separate negotiations between France and England.
June 1761.</div>

<p>The terms offered by the French were not unreasonable. The
difficulties lay in Pitt's views as to the rights of England, which were
undoubtedly very high. He had, as he said that he was able to do, raised
England from her degradation. He had done this by means of a successful
war, and had no mind to lose his work or to consent to what would be but
a mere cessation of hostilities. He would have, he said, no new Peace of
Utrecht. Choiseul's first offer (on the 26th of March) was, that each of
the belligerents should keep what they held in Europe on the 1st of May,
in West India and Africa on the 1st of July, and in India on the 1st of
September. Pitt refused this, insisting that <span class="sidenote">Pitt opposes peace.</span>
the date fixed in all cases should be that of the signature of the
treaty. He was hoping in fact that fresh victories would improve his
position; nor was he disappointed. Before the end of July Belleisle,
an island which must be considered an integral part of France,
Dominique in the West Indies, and Pondicherry in the East, were added
to our conquests. The territorial arrangements were for the most part
easily settled; but three demands of the French Pitt obstinately
refused to grant. These were the restoration of one of her African
settlements and Belleisle in exchange for portions of Germany then in
her possession&mdash;these Pitt demanded without exchange; secondly,
compensation for prizes taken before the declaration of war, and lastly,
the withdrawal of all English troops from Germany. As the first of these
demands was not unreasonable, as the second was obviously just, and the
third belonged, and could probably have been transferred, to the general
Congress, Pitt would scarcely have refused them had he not seen reason
for believing that the propositions of the French were hollow. The fact
is, he was already beginning to suspect, and more than suspect, the
existence of a treaty inimical to English interests between France and
Spain. Ever since the accession of Charles III. to the Spanish throne, in
the year 1759, the two Courts had been gradually approaching one
<span class="sidenote">Suspecting the existence of the Family
Compact.</span> another; and the policy which Marlborough's wars had
been designed to check was gradually winning its object.
In July De Bussy, on presenting the draft of the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1039" id="Page_1039">[1039]</a></span>
treaty, appended to it certain claims on the part of Spain, desiring
that these might be settled at the same time as the French claims. Pitt
was naturally indignant at this, and haughtily replied, that France was
"not at any time to presume a right of intermeddling in such disputes
between Great Britain and Spain." The Spanish minister, General Wall,
owned that he was cognizant of the measure, but expressed peaceful wishes
with regard to England. However, though Bristol, the English minister
at Madrid, had been so completely deceived that he continued to assert
the friendly disposition of the Spanish Court, the correctness of Pitt's
surmises became evident, when in August the arrangement known as the
Family Compact was signed. By this treaty the Bourbon houses of Spain
and France contracted a close and perpetual alliance. Besides France and
Spain the Bourbon Princes of Naples and Parma were to be admitted to it.
There was a secret clause binding Spain to declare war on England if
peace was not made before May 1762. The knowledge of this treaty induced
Pitt not only to break off negotiations, but to determine upon war with
Spain, for which he immediately made preparations, planning a great
expedition against Havannah in the West and Manilla in the East Indies.
With his usual haughtiness, he urged these measures
<span class="sidenote">Pitt resigns. Oct. 5, 1761.</span> upon the
Council, but Temple alone supported him. He indignantly declared that
he would not be responsible for measures he did not manage, and on the
5th of October resigned. Thus terminated that splendid administration
which had raised England from the depths of degradation to a position of
first-rate importance in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bute virtual minister.</div>

<p>Bute was at once practically supreme in the Council, although he had
yet to rid himself of Newcastle. He was afraid of Pitt's popularity, and
did his best to injure him by persuading him to accept a pension, and
the title of Lady Chatham for his wife, hoping by that means to make it
appear that Pitt was not hostile to his Government, or at all events
to wreck his popularity, which rested largely on the public belief in
his disinterestedness. Lord Egremont became Secretary in his place.
Before the year was over Pitt's wisdom was vindicated. The change of
ministry in England and the safe arrival of the treasure-ships, which
Pitt would have forestalled, changed the tone of the Spanish Government,
and even the pacific Bute found it necessary to declare war in January
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTWO_WAR_WITH_SPAIN" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTWO_WAR_WITH_SPAIN"></a>War with Spain. 1762.</span> 1762. Already the
impossibility of Bute's peaceful view was demonstrated, but he none the
less prevented the payment of the Prussian subsidy; although this looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">[1040]</a></span>
very like a breach of faith, it could be urged in extenuation that
Frederick's need was much lessened by the death of the Czarina and the
accession of Peter III., a devoted friend and admirer of the Prussian
King. Bute's policy was indeed so completely opposed to that of his
predecessors, that there is reason to believe that he even used his
influence to induce Russia to withdraw from its new alliance. This change
of policy afforded Newcastle, who was conscious that he was sooner or
later to be got rid of, an opportunity of leaving the ministry with
dignity. On his resignation Bute at once named himself Prime Minister,
and proceeded to carry out, in some points at least, his favourite
principles. These were peace at almost any price, and the abandonment of
continental connections, the increase and restoration of the power of the
Crown, and Government without bribery. But these aspirations degenerated
in practice into a war, which was successful owing to his predecessor's
arrangements, a vindictive assault upon the Whig party, and the most
shameless corruption ever practised in England. The expeditions which
Pitt had planned were carried out. Martinique, held to be impregnable,
and with it Granada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, were captured by a
squadron under Rodney, and this was but a stepping-stone to the capture
of the still greater prize&mdash;Havannah. The expedition against the
Philippine Islands was equally successful.</p>

<p>But Bute, in his eagerness for peace, did not even wait to hear the
result of the expeditions, but at once reopened peace negotiations
with France. Left to himself, he would have taken no account of the
last great conquests. Councillors less anxious for peace succeeded in
getting them exchanged for Florida. In November the peace was
<span class="sidenote">Terms of the peace. Nov. 3, 1762.</span>
signed. The conditions were much the same as those of the preceding
year. America passed wholly to the English, the French keeping the
rights of fishing round Newfoundland. England kept Tobago, Dominica, St.
Vincent, and Granada, but restored Martinique and St. Lucia. Minorca and
Belleisle were to be exchanged. The French evacuated their conquests in
Germany, but on the other hand&mdash;and this was a concession Pitt had
refused&mdash;Goree was restored to France, and the English army was
withdrawn from Germany. In India the French were to have no military
establishment, but their factories were restored. All claims on the part
of Spain were entirely rejected. On the whole, the peace, though it did
not destroy the House of Bourbon, as Pitt would have wished, probably
gave England as much as she had a right to expect. The conclusion of the treaty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1041" id="Page_1041">[1041]</a></span>
rendered easier by Frederick's continued successes in Germany.
Although the Czarina Catherine, who had succeeded Peter, had
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTHREE_CLOSE_OF_THE_SEVEN_YEARS_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTHREE_CLOSE_OF_THE_SEVEN_YEARS_WAR"></a>Close of the Seven Years' War.</span>
reverted to the old policy of Russia, and withdrawn her troops from
Frederick's assistance, he had been able to retain his superiority
throughout the campaign. Prince Ferdinand had gained fresh successes in
Westphalia, and had taken Cassel from the French; while Prince Henry, the
King's brother, had won a victory at Freiberg, which closed the Seven
Years' War.</p>

<p>Bute, while thus obtaining peace, though in a way so irritating to
our German friends that England stood henceforward absolutely
without allies, had been carrying on his vindictive attack upon the
Whigs. The opportunity selected for this purpose was the passage
of the peace through Parliament. Grenville, a man of firmness, but
<span class="sidenote">Attack on the Whigs. Feb. 10, 1763.</span>
without commanding abilities, and deficient in tact, had taken Pitt's
place as Leader of the House of Commons. But he was not regarded as
strong enough to make head against the opposition which was expected,
for the Whigs of all sections, conscious of Bute's designs against them,
were beginning to combine. Bute selected a man of greater powers to
assist him. He bargained with Fox (whose conscience was not scrupulous
when money was to be made) to assume the lead of the House. It was hoped
that he might bring some Whigs with him. This he found himself unable
to do, and with consummate audacity set to work to purchase a majority.
The Paymaster's office became in fact a shop for the purchase of votes,
£200 being the least price given. Against such a majority all efforts
were of course useless, and the peace received the approbation of
Parliament. After this victory vengeance began. The Duke of Devonshire,
the head of the great Whig house of Cavendish, for declining to attend
a Cabinet Council, was rudely deprived of the office of Chamberlain,
and the King with his own hand scratched his name off the list of Privy
Councillors. All placemen who had voted against the peace were dismissed.
Newcastle and Rockingham were removed from their Lord Lieutenancies,
and even the meanest officers of the administration&mdash;tax-gatherers
and customhouse officers, who owed their places to Whig patronage, were
removed. Bute appeared triumphant. Even the cider tax, a ridiculously
unfair excise suggested <span class="sidenote">Bute resigns. April 8, 1763.</span>
by the ignorance of Dashwood, his Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
carried by a large majority in his venal House. Suddenly Bute resigned.
It is difficult to explain why. Perhaps it was because he was
conscious of the unpopularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1042" id="Page_1042">[1042]</a></span>
he had incurred. His Peace of Paris was distasteful to the nation; he
had driven from office Pitt, the favourite of the people; he was a
Scotchman; the voice of scandal constantly coupled his name with that
of the Princess Dowager of Wales, and the odious name of favourite
was indissolubly attached to him. Whether well or ill founded, his
unpopularity had reached such a pitch, that he was afraid to leave his
house without a bodyguard of prize-fighters. Perhaps experience had
taught him his unfitness to conduct the Government. Perhaps, and this was
the general belief of the time, he preferred the irresponsible power of
the favourite to the dangers and responsibility of
<span class="sidenote">He names Grenville as his successor.</span> the
minister. He named Grenville for his successor, and as he had always used
him as his creature, he probably still hoped to find him a pliant tool.
In this he was disappointed; and though for a few years he doubtless
had much private influence with the King, this part of his career has
been much exaggerated, and he himself complained bitterly of the King's
ingratitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Triumvirate ministry. 1763.</div>

<p>With Grenville the Secretaries of State, Lord Egremont and Lord
Halifax, were regarded as holding the direction of public affairs. This
ministry has therefore been sometimes called The Triumvirate. Bute found
them by no means ready to accept his interference, and soon began to
intrigue against them. Grenville more than once complained to the King
of his want of confidence. The sudden death of Lord Egremont gave an
opportunity for a change in the ministry, and Bute so far changed his
former policy as to recommend the King to send for Pitt. A long interview
with the King, in which Pitt stated the necessity of bringing back some
of the Whig connection to power, left him with the impression that he was
to be minister, and he wrote to the Whig chiefs accordingly. But two days
after, on a second interview, he found matters changed. The King wished
the Earl of Northumberland, Bute's intended son-in-law, to be Prime
Minister, and desired several of the present ministry to be retained.
This Pitt would not hear of, designating Temple, Devonshire, and others
who had just fallen under the King's displeasure, as his colleagues. The
negotiation <span class="sidenote">Bedford joins the ministry.</span>
was broken off. Probably on the day which intervened between the two
interviews Bute had changed his mind. In carrying through the peace
negotiations he had been assisted by that section of the Whigs which was
under the influence of the Duke of Bedford. It is to this section that
Fox belonged. The Duke, though of a retiring character, was now induced to accept office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1043" id="Page_1043">[1043]</a></span>
by a false rumour, that Pitt had expressly declared that he would not
admit him to any Government of which he was the chief. A mixed
ministry of the followers of Grenville and Bedford was formed, and
is generally known by the name of the Bedford Ministry. The
Secretaries of State were Halifax and Lord Sandwich, a man of
mean character and licentious morals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The trial of Wilkes. 1763.</div>

<p>The new ministry met Parliament on the 15th of November, and both
Houses were at once occupied with questions with regard to Wilkes.
The unpopularity of Bute had found expression in numerous pamphlets.
Among the Opposition writers was Wilkes, member for Aylesbury, who, in
conjunction with an author of the name of Churchill, had established a
paper, <i>The North Briton</i>, in which the favourite and his Government
had been very roughly handled, and which won popularity by unreasoning
general assaults upon the Scotch nation. He had so far exceeded the
usual practice of pamphleteers of the time as to write the names of
his opponents at full length, instead of employing initials. When the
King had prorogued Parliament (April 23rd) on Bute's resignation, he
had spoken of the peace as honourable to his crown and beneficial
to the people. This produced an attack in the famous No. 45 of <cite>The
North Briton</cite>. Grenville had at once proceeded against the author. A
general warrant (that is, a warrant in which no individual names are
mentioned) was issued against the authors, printers, and publishers of
the paper, and under it Wilkes was apprehended, his house and papers
being also ransacked. He at once became a political martyr. The chiefs
of the Opposition, Temple and Grafton, visited him in his prison, and
he proceeded to try the validity of his arrest. Chief Justice Pratt,
before whom the case came, held that Wilkes was exempted from arrest
by his privilege as a member; for a member of Parliament is free from
arrest on all charges except those of treason, felony, and breach of the
peace, and a libel, he said, could not be construed as a breach of the
peace. But though the law had failed to punish him, he was pursued by the
vengeance of the Government; he was deprived of his commission in the
militia, and his supporter, Temple, was removed from the Lord Lieutenancy
of Buckinghamshire. The result of the trial was received with public
rejoicings in all corners of England. This dispute between Government and
a scurrilous writer, of most licentious morals, would be scarcely worth
mentioning, although it occupied nearly the whole session, were it not
one of the proofs of the want of harmony existing between Parliament
and those whom Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1044" id="Page_1044">[1044]</a></span>
was held to represent. It was one of several incidents which showed
that the venal House of Commons, consisting of nominees of the
Court or great families, was rapidly ceasing to command the
obedience of the people, and that the machinery of the Constitution
was thereby becoming dislocated.</p>

<p>The question at once came before both Houses. In the House of Lords it
assumed a personal form. Lord Sandwich, a former friend of Wilkes, and
his associate in his greatest debauchery, but now Secretary of State, did
not think it unbecoming to produce an obscene parody on Pope's "Essay on
Man," of which Wilkes was the author, and demand his punishment. The book
had never been published; fourteen copies had been privately printed; it
had come into Sandwich's possession when Wilkes's house was ransacked,
and afterwards by tampering with Wilkes's printer. Sandwich complained
of it as a breach of privilege, for it was addressed to him. "Awake, my
Sandwich!" it began, instead of "Awake, my St. John!" of Pope's Essay,
and ridiculous notes were added, attributed to Warburton, Bishop of
Gloucester, who had annotated Pope's work. In the House of Commons Wilkes
rose and complained of his imprisonment as a breach of privilege, but
he met with little sympathy. By a large majority No. 45 was voted to
be a seditious libel, and ordered to be burnt by the common hangman. A
dangerous riot was the consequence, nor was the operation completed till
a jackboot and petticoat, the popular emblems of the Princess of Wales
and Lord Bute, were committed to the flames to share the fate of the
obnoxious publication. Further proceedings against Wilkes were postponed
by a duel in which he was engaged <span class="sidenote">Wilkes is expelled by the Lower House.</span>
with a Mr. Martin, who had grossly insulted him, and in which he was
wounded; but he was eventually expelled from his place in the House.
On the two constitutional questions which were involved in this
quarrel&mdash;the construction to be given to the privilege of members
and the legality of general warrants&mdash;the popular party was
defeated, in spite of the powerful support of Pitt. In opposition to the
Courts of Law, Parliament held that privilege could not cover a seditious
libel; and Grenville and his majority contrived to shelve a resolution
which was introduced declaring the illegality of general warrants. The
whole question excited the intensest interest; the House is said to
have once sat for seventeen hours. Wilkes, unable to withstand all the
assaults upon him, had, in spite of his popularity, been obliged to
withdraw to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">[1045]</a></span></p>

<p>Grenville and his ministry had hardly completed this quarrel, in
which they had wantonly embroiled Parliament and people, when
they took a fresh step which, though well intentioned, was destined,
from the way in which it was carried out, to lose England the best of
her colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the American provinces.</div>

<p>The thirteen American provinces owed their origin to many different
causes, and were very distinct both in their character and laws. There
was, in the first place, the group of New England provinces, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire (which included what is now called Vermont),
and Rhode Island; these owed their origin to the Pilgrim Fathers, and
though the first zeal of their Puritan religion had died away, much
of the stern character of their original founders remained among the
population: their capital was Boston, almost surrounded by the sea,
and already a port of very considerable importance and wealth; the
Hudson formed their boundary towards the west. Then there came a group
of provinces originally belonging to the Dutch, and known as the New
Netherlands. These had come into the hands of England during the war
between Holland and England in the reign of Charles II., and had been
granted to the Duke of York. New Amsterdam became New York, and Fort
Orange, higher up the stream, Albany. Another part of the same grant was
New Jersey, lying between the Hudson and the Delaware. This had been
given for payment by the Duke of York to Lord Berkeley and Sir George
Carteret; the western part had been subsequently parted with by Berkeley
to the Quakers, and the whole province, which was surrendered to the
Crown in the reign of Queen Anne, was therefore known commonly as the
Jerseys, and was peopled almost exclusively by Quakers, Presbyterians
and Anabaptists. Spreading from their colony in New Jersey, the Quakers,
under their great leader William Penn, had occupied the large province
of Pennsylvania, with its capital Philadelphia lying inland to the west.
One other province belongs to this group, Maryland, which was regarded
as a sort of appendage to Pennsylvania, but had a separate assembly of
its own; the governor however was generally the same as the Pennsylvanian
governor. Below these two groups were three great colonies, owing their
origin to less easily defined sources. Virginia, south of the Potomac,
originally founded by Raleigh, had then (by a grant of King James I.)
passed into the hands of merchant adventurers. Behaving badly, and
quarrelling with their colonists, they were deprived of their rights,
and in 1624 the colony became a Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">[1046]</a></span>
colony. It had been peopled principally by Church of England men and
by men of good English birth. As the oldest colony it was the best
peopled, while the birth and character of its proprietors, who resembled
English gentlemen, caused them to be regarded as the aristocracy of the
colonies. The two Carolinas had been granted to a number of proprietors
in the reign of Charles II., but, as in most other cases, the original
proprietors had quarrelled with the people, and sold their rights to
the Crown. Below these Carolinas was Georgia, founded for philanthropic
purposes as a refuge for insolvent debtors and persecuted Germans by
General Oglethorpe, the originator of the inquiry into the English
prisons in 1728. The only power not English now in North America was that
of Spain, which had received a portion of Louisiana from the French in
exchange for Florida, which they had been obliged to cede to the English.
French influence had disappeared after the Peace of Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitution of the provinces.</div>

<p>There was an infinite variety of religion, law and government in these
provinces, but in all a certain assimilation to the English Constitution;
a house of assembly, an upper house or council, sometimes elected,
sometimes nominated by the governor, and the governor himself in the
Crown colonies nominated by the King and the proprietors in conjunction.
The population appears to have been about two and a half millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restrictions on colonial trade.</div>

<p>The old view of the use of colonies was that they should be employed
entirely for the advantage of the mother country. It was held that, by
the mere fact of their existence, and for the protection they received,
they were bound by a debt of gratitude. They were thus the constant
subject of mercantile legislation in favour of the mother country, and
by the existing navigation laws very close restrictions were laid upon
their trade. By those laws the colonies were prohibited from procuring
a large number of articles&mdash;those, namely, which formed the chief
manufactures of England&mdash;anywhere except from the mother country.
They thus became naturally one of our principal purchasers. Although
their imports into England were considerable, the balance of trade was
constantly against them&mdash;that is, taken as a whole, they constantly
owed large sums of money to England. This balance had, of course, from
time to time to be made up by payments in actual money, which was chiefly
procured by the colonies by means of illicit trade, carried on partly
with the West India Islands, but chiefly with the Spanish colonies of
America, and was illicit chiefly in that it broke the customhouse regulations of Spain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[1047]</a></span>
colonial illicit or free trade, as it was called, was regarded in point
of morality as something quite different from European smuggling.
It was carried on openly and systematically by the best colonial
merchants, and enabled the colonies to get rid of their timber and
those wooden products known under the name of lumber, and also of
a considerable quantity of their farm produce which would otherwise
have been wasted. A wise minister would not have thought of
meddling with such a business, which was in fact the only means by
which the colonists were enabled to carry on conveniently their
trade with England. But Grenville, with his narrow and legal turn
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFOUR_SUPPRESSION_OF_SMUGGLING" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFOUR_SUPPRESSION_OF_SMUGGLING"></a>General suppression of smuggling.</span> of
mind, could see no difference between colonial smuggling and smuggling
in England. This he was determined to put down, and not content with
the ordinary means of repression, English men-of-war were employed in
all directions as customhouse vessels, and naval officers, people said,
were degraded into customhouse officers of the King of Spain. The effect
was a crushing blow to the trade of America. And, as if to render the
position of the colonists still more distressing, in 1764 a series of
enactments were made, laying duties upon various articles for the benefit
of England,&mdash;at the same time declaring for the first time the right
of England to raise a revenue from her colonies; and while the quantity
of money in America had been considerably diminished by the stoppage of
the free trade, the present Act was rendered more irksome by ordering all
the duties imposed to be paid in hard cash into the English Exchequer.
It was coupled, too, with another Act stopping the use of paper money
in America. Taken together, this series of arrangements had therefore
produced the following effects&mdash;a large branch of commerce, the
chief source of ready money, was destroyed; at the same time more ready
money was demanded by England; and the colonists saw themselves prevented
even from carrying on their domestic trade in the ordinary channels.</p>

<p>These measures had produced retaliation from the Americans; it
had been determined that as little trade as possible should be carried
on with England. Lamb was not to be eaten, and lambs were not
killed, in order to increase the stock of sheep for the supply of
the wool which was England's great manufacture; and in all other
possible ways men denied themselves European luxuries. It has
been said that the preamble of the Act for the new duties stated the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFIVE_THE_STAMP_ACT" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFIVE_THE_STAMP_ACT"></a>The Stamp Act.</span> necessity for raising a
revenue from the English colonies, and at the same time Grenville had proposed a Stamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1048" id="Page_1048">[1048]</a></span>
Act as one of the means of raising such revenue. With singular want of
wisdom, though with kindly feeling, he put off bringing in a Bill for
the establishment of this tax, which would be an article of excise or
inland duty, till the assemblies of the different colonies had stated
their views with regard to it. The Americans, though probably without any
real legal grounds, drew a line between the levying of customs and the
imposing of an inland tax. It is probable that by the strict letter of
the law they were liable to both, for even the Long Parliament had only
granted temporary exemptions from taxation. But when their attention was
drawn to the intentions and claims of the English Parliament, and when
a tax, new in fact though perhaps not in principle, was suggested to
them, and a year given them to talk it over, it was natural that their
opposition should be roused. Five colonies sent petitions against the
new measures, but they were wholly disregarded, and the Stamp Act passed
without much opposition in Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFIVE_THE_KINGS_ILLNESS" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFIVE_THE_KINGS_ILLNESS"></a>The King's illness.</div>

<p>The ministry seemed unusually strong&mdash;it had triumphed
over Wilkes; and its financial policy, though ruinous, had been
accepted&mdash;when suddenly the King became alarmingly ill, suffering
from that loss of intellect which afterwards incapacitated him from
reigning. In alarm at this illness, on his recovery he desired a Regency
Bill to be passed. The natural person to have appointed Regent would have
been the Queen. The King had been hastily married in the first year of
his reign (1761) to the Princess Sophia of Mecklenburg, a marriage which,
as it was contracted chiefly by the influence of the Princess Dowager
and Lord Bute, and without the will of the King, for the purpose of
withdrawing him from his dangerous love for Lady Sarah Lennox, might have
been expected to turn out ill, but which became in fact a happy life-long
union. The King however, instead of suggesting, as was natural, that his
wife should be Regent, desired to keep the appointment in
<span class="sidenote">The Regency Bill. 1755.</span> his own hands. The
Government objected to this, without limitations, and suggested that the
King's choice should lie among the Queen and the members of the Royal
Family resident in England. When this Bill was brought forward it was
pertinently asked who the Royal Family were? and it became evident that
the ministry did not themselves know how to define it. They ultimately
concluded, however, that the Princess Dowager was not a relation of her
own son. In making this ridiculous assertion, and insulting the Princess
by excluding her name, they were probably instigated by the dread of a Bute ministry in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1049" id="Page_1049">[1049]</a></span>
case anything should happen to the King. In pursuance of this policy,
Halifax hurried to the King, and persuaded him that the unpopularity of
the Princess Dowager was such that the introduction of her name in the
Bill would infallibly be followed by its omission on the demand of the
Commons, and the Princess thus exposed to public insult. The King, taken
off his guard, and naturally wishing to spare his mother so public a
mark of disrespect, consented to the omission of her name. The Bill was
brought into the House of Lords and passed, limiting the regency to the
Queen and the descendants of the late King and Queen resident in England.
When the Lord Chancellor&mdash;an honest man&mdash;explained to the King
what he had done, he was much disturbed, but no entreaties of his could
move Grenville to change the Bill. Upon its introduction into the Lower
House the absence of the name of the Princess was at once remarked, and
a large majority voted for its introduction; thus making obvious to the
King the shameless trick of which he had been the victim. For this he
could not forgive Grenville and Bedford, and at once began arrangements
for getting rid of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations for a change of ministry.</div>



<p>For this purpose he called in the assistance and experience of
his uncle the Duke of Cumberland, whose upright and consistent
conduct had given him an authority and importance
which he had not sought. He was a firm Whig, and
had of late years regarded Pitt as the real head of that
great party. To him therefore the Duke now applied. In a long interview
Pitt explained his views and stated his terms. He demanded
that an alliance with the Protestant powers of Europe should be
entered into, to balance the Family Compact, that general warrants
should henceforward be declared illegal, and that officers
dismissed for political reasons should be restored. Everything
seemed to promise success, but Pitt wished to see Temple, to
whom he was bound by ties of relationship, party, personal friendship,
and even pecuniary assistance. After his interview with
Temple it was evident that some obstacle had arisen, and the
negotiation was broken off. The fact is, that Temple, infinitely Pitt's
inferior, had come to terms with George Grenville, and was planning
a family Grenville ministry; and Pitt's lofty view of his obligations
to his brother-in-law prevented him from breaking with him. The
King was thus thrown back, bound hand and foot, into the hands of
his old ministry. They would consent to remain in their places if the
King would pledge himself to dismiss Bute from his friendship, to get
rid of Fox, now Lord Holland, from the Paymastership, turn Mr. Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">[1050]</a></span>
Mackenzie out of his place as Privy Seal for Scotland, make Lord Granby
Commander-in-Chief instead of the Duke of Cumberland, and give Ireland to
the ministry, which meant the dismissal of the Earl of Northumberland,
Bute's son-in-law, from the Lord-Lieutenancy&mdash;a mere set of personal
and vindictive conditions, contrasting finely with Pitt's political
demands. Such as they were the King was obliged to accept them, but
he could not bring himself to like or trust his ministry, and after a
strong, though not perhaps unduly strong, representation from Bedford
against the underhand employment of the King's influence against his own
ministers, he determined that he would rid himself of them, even at the
cost of accepting the Whig Houses. Pitt was again applied to, talked
honestly and simply to the Duke of Cumberland, stating as his terms an
European alliance, the abolition of general warrants, the repeal of the
cider tax, and a change in American taxation, thus in his two sets of
terms clearing himself of all complicity with the follies of the present
Government. But Temple refused to take the position of Prime Minister
except <span class="sidenote">Pitt retires into private life.</span>
as the head of a Grenville administration, and Pitt with infinite sorrow
gave up the negotiation, sold his house at Hayes, and declared his
intention of retiring to Somersetshire, where an admiring stranger had
lately left him the house of Burton-Pynsent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ministry of the Whig Houses.</div>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, finding that Pitt was by some means separated
from the great Whig party, applied directly to its acknowledged family
chiefs, who agreed to form a ministry, putting forward as their head Lord
Rockingham, a sporting man of sound sense and large possessions, but no
power of language or popular government.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Under him were the Duke of Grafton
with no parliamentary experience, General Conway, a sensible man, but
without any of the gifts of leadership, to whom was intrusted the
management of the House of Commons, and the veteran Duke of Newcastle, to
whom was given the Privy Seal, with a special perquisite of the patronage
of the Church. With the exception of Lord Chancellor Northington, there
was in fact scarcely any one of the requisite degree of efficiency in
the ministry. Its life could not be a long one. It is fair to say that
Burke, who was now first introduced to public life by Lord Rockingham,
speaks highly of him for enlargement of mind, clear sense, and unshaken
fortitude.</p>

<p>This weak Government found on its hands a question of difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1051" id="Page_1051">[1051]</a></span>
too great for it. The Stamp Act had been very badly received in
America; there had been riots in many of the towns, involving much
loss of property; the collectors had been obliged to renounce their
offices, and the stamped paper had been destroyed. Virginia had
solemnly protested in regular form through the House of Burgesses;
and a Congress of delegates of nine or ten of the States had met at
<span class="sidenote">Question of American taxation.</span>
New York (October), and passed resolutions, claiming for the provincial
assemblies the exclusive right of taxation. At home the merchants had
begun to feel the effects of the self-denying determination of the
Americans, in a diminution of their trade, and of the enforcement of
the laws against smuggling, in the impossibility of getting money
payments for their goods. The sum due is stated variously at two to three
millions. During the recess of Parliament the writings and proceedings
of the ministry had an air of weakness, and finally, unable to act
vigorously themselves, they determined to put the matter into the hands
of Parliament.</p>

<p>In January Parliament met, and on the 14th the subject was
brought before the House. There was a great debate. Burke then
made his maiden speech, and was followed by Pitt, who had not yet
expressed his views, and had indeed absented himself from the House
for a year. Expectation was raised to the highest pitch, and in a

1766.</span> magnificent speech he declared, what till that moment had
in England been scarcely thought of, that Parliament had <i>no right</i>
to tax the colonies, for taxation and representation went hand in
hand. He however, like the Americans, drew a line between taxation and
customs. Customs he regarded in the light of trade regulations, and
therefore in the hands of the Imperial Legislature. After a speech of
weak acquiescence from Conway, Grenville made an able reply; he exposed
the fallacy of distinguishing between taxes and duties, alleged many
instances of the taxation of unrepresented bodies, and charged the
Americans with ingratitude for declining to pay for a war so entirely
in their own interest as the last. Pitt, though he had spoken, was,
contrary to the rules of the House, called upon by the general voice to
speak again. He rose, and declared himself ready to answer Grenville on
every point. His reply was such as a statesman must make to a lawyer. "I
rejoice," he cried, "that America has resisted; three millions of people
so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be
slaves would have been fit instruments to have made slaves of the rest."
He had not come down with the "statute book doubled down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">[1052]</a></span>
dog's ears to defend the cause of liberty," and as to gratitude, he
supposed that all the bounties to America were for English purposes.
There was a trade with America of £3,000,000 a year, and it was trade
which carried England through the last war. "This you owe to America,
and shall a miserable financier come with a boast that he can fetch a
peppercorn into the Exchequer to the loss of millions to the nation?" He
closed by stating his belief that England could crush America to atoms,
but the triumph would be hazardous. If she fell she would fall like the
strong man; she would embrace the pillars of the State, and pull down
the Constitution with her. He advised the immediate and entire repeal
of the Stamp Act, but that the other rights of Parliament, apart from
taxation, should be clearly declared. There was no doubt much weight in
Grenville's instances of imperfect representation, but they were not
wisely urged against Pitt, who in his first speech had himself pointed
out in very trenchant words the wretched state of the representative
system in England. Indeed, he almost alone seems to have understood
the real meaning of the Wilkes riots, and to have wished to bring
Parliament and the people into harmony. Pitt's bold speech encouraged
the ministers to act, and after a long examination of witnesses, among
<span class="sidenote">The Stamp Act repealed.</span> whom Franklin, who
had come over as an agent to oppose the Act, was the most important, the
Repeal of the Stamp Act was proposed and carried amid the enthusiasm of
the mercantile and liberal world on the 21st of February. For this time
Pitt's political wisdom had saved England from a disastrous breach with
her colonies.</p>

<p>Once embarked on a policy of repeal, the Rockingham ministry
continued to reverse the acts of its predecessors. The trade of
America was again fostered, and Dominique and Jamaica were
made free ports; the obnoxious cider tax was ameliorated, general
warrants were condemned, as was also the practice of depriving
military officers of their commands for political opposition. General
Conway was himself the last victim of this practice. Foreign
manufactured silks were also prohibited, and thus the clamours of
the Spitalfields weavers were silenced, which, during Grenville's
administration, had produced a riot directed chiefly against the Duke
of Bedford. But, in spite of these healing measures, the Government
was never strong. The King detested it as being distinctly a party
<span class="sidenote">Weakness of the Government.</span>
Government, and the abilities of the ministry were not
conspicuous. They tried in vain to induce Pitt to join
them. Upon the failure of this negotiation the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1053" id="Page_1053">[1053]</a></span>
was glad to have recourse again to that great man. For the third time
since the close of his administration Pitt had the destinies of the
nation in his hand. Twice his Quixotic attachment to his friend Lord
Temple had ruined his plans. He had always aimed at a broader basis
of government than mere personal or party connection, and during his
great administration had succeeded in acting independently. There was
something therefore in common between him and the King, though no doubt
their view of the destruction of party was different. To Pitt it meant
the selection of able men of all political connections, under his own
pre-eminent guidance, to form a ministry, which should work for the
national good, and be responsible to the nation. To the King it meant the
selection of efficient administrators, without any pre-eminent minister,
and answerable to himself. There was apparently, however, enough in
common between them to induce Pitt to accept the administration, and to
break off his connection with Temple, who insisted, as a condition of
his support, that the whole of the Rockingham party should be dismissed.
Pitt, on the other hand, determined on a fusion with that party.
<span class="sidenote">Pitt becomes Lord Chatham and Prime Minister. July
1766.</span> Rockingham himself left the ministry, but his chief supporters
remained under Pitt. Grafton was nominally Prime Minister and First
Lord of the Treasury, Conway and Shelburne were the Secretaries of
State, Charles Townshend Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Northington
became Lord President, and was succeeded as Chancellor by Pitt's friend
Pratt, Lord Camden. Pitt himself surprised the world by taking a peerage
as Lord Chatham and the small office of Privy Seal. In acting thus
he no doubt miscalculated his strength; he felt himself unable from
his growing infirmities to continue to lead the House of Commons, and
believed, as he had indeed good right to believe, that his personal
character and influence would enable him, in whatever position he might
be, to blend the ministry from whatever party he chose them into an
harmonious administration. The effect did not answer his expectations.
His acceptance of a peerage was regarded as the acceptance of a bribe,
especially as his avowed principle in the selection of his colleagues was
the same as that rendered so unpopular by Bute and the King&mdash;the
destruction of party. He thus lost his popularity; of party influence he
had little or none; he was deficient in knowledge of party tactics, which
during his great administration had been in the hands of Newcastle. His
natural arrogance had grown on him, and was rendered worse by his
<a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYSEVEN_HIS_ILLNESS" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYSEVEN_HIS_ILLNESS"></a>irritable state of health. He tried to win the Bedford party, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">[1054]</a></span>
would not give them enough. He introduced a number of Tories and
courtiers into the administration, and thus shocked the great Whig party;
and when, as shortly happened, illness obscured for a time his intellect,
the ministry lost all cohesion and fell to pieces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chatham's comprehensive plans.</div>

<p>But though thus failing as a tactician, it was impossible for Pitt
to be in office without setting on foot magnificent and beneficial
plans. He immediately began the new foreign policy which he had so often
sketched. Mr. Hans Stanley was despatched to the Courts of Berlin and
St. Petersburg to cement an alliance against the house of Bourbon. But
at Berlin he met but a cold reception. Frederick, whose character was as
mean and selfish as his abilities were great, did not care in the least
for the defence of Protestantism or for the safety of England, now that
his own safety did not depend upon her friendship. Indeed, since Bute's
withdrawal from the war he had hated England heartily, and alleged the
want of continuity in English policy as a reason for engaging in no
alliances. In truth, his mind was already fixed upon his wicked plan for
the dismemberment of Poland. Pitt, now Lord Chatham, was thus foiled
at the outset, and his foreign policy failed. Two other great schemes
he was unable to bring to completion; one for the better government of
Ireland, and the other for what he saw would speedily become a matter of
the greatest importance&mdash;the regulation of our Indian conquests. He
intended to do what we have but lately seen done,&mdash;assume for the
Crown the sovereignty of India, and confine the Company to their proper
and mercantile pursuits.</p>

<p>In the midst of these vast schemes, having given indications that he
contemplated a Reform Bill, an India Bill, the pacification and better
government of Ireland, alliances which would have forestalled the great
alliances of his son, and a plan which might perhaps have retained
America, Chatham fell ill at Bath, and the Government ceased to have a
natural head.</p>

<p>While Chatham was thus absent from his post his reckless Chancellor
<span class="sidenote">Chatham's illness and mental failure. Jan.

revenue from America. The sum was indeed a very small one&mdash;£40,000,
and raised upon tea, glass, and paper, and therefore falling, it might be
urged, under the head of those mercantile arrangements which the colonies
admitted the <span class="sidenote">Townshend's financial measures.</span>
right of Parliament to make; but in the present state of affairs in
America it was a mere act of madness. The repeal of the Stamp Act had been made conditional on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1055" id="Page_1055">[1055]</a></span>
the repayment of property injured in the riots. This the Assemblies had
agreed to only with much grumbling, and the Assembly of New York had
gone so far in its opposition to a requisition for supplying necessaries
to the troops that it had been suspended. While America was in this
irritable condition Townshend's measure came to inflame the smouldering
mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYEIGHT_CORRUPTION_OF_PARLIAMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYEIGHT_CORRUPTION_OF_PARLIAMENT"></a>Corruption of Parliament. 1768.</div>

<p>What Chatham had spoken of as the rotten part of the Constitution
was, early in the year 1768, brought into full play. There was a
general election, in which bribery and the purchase of seats were
shamelessly employed. £4000 is said to have been the average price of
a small borough. Oxford offered to re-elect its members for £7500, to
be applied to the liquidation of a corporation debt; and to show how
ridiculously inefficient the representation was, it may be mentioned
that in a population of eight millions there were only a hundred and
sixty thousand voters. The people were by this time beginning, though
perhaps somewhat blindly, to feel that the representative body did not
really represent them, and, as usual, they fixed upon one individual,
and that not a very worthy one, as a representative of this feeling.
Wilkes had already been a popular martyr and the victim of <span
class="sidenote">Wilkes elected for Middlesex. 1768.</span>
the vengeance both of King and Parliament. He now presented himself for
election in London. He was there rejected, but immediately afterwards
elected by a large majority in the county of Middlesex. His election
produced riots in London, and the Government&mdash;contrary probably
to their own judgment, and urged by the King&mdash;determined to
interfere. Wilkes was apprehended as an outlaw, and riots ensued,
which were suppressed only by the use of the troops. Twenty people
were killed and wounded. The military were not only acquitted when
tried upon the charge of murder, but were rewarded by Government. The
anger of the people increased, and in the riots which ensued in various
parts of England the point immediately at issue was complicated with
other social questions, many depressed trades taking the opportunity
of exhibiting their discontent. The Government which had to deal with
this difficulty was the Duke of Grafton's&mdash;Chatham immediately
upon his recovery had retired from it, and Lord Shelburne had also left
it. Grafton, without views of his own, had become the mere tool in the
hands of the King and his party. George was set with dogged obstinacy
upon the suppression of insubordination in America and the destruction
of Wilkes in England. Under such circumstances the war with the people was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1056" id="Page_1056">[1056]</a></span>
carried to extremes. When a vacancy occurred in the representation
for Middlesex there was a fresh contest, and Glyn, a partisan of
Wilkes, was elected. In the attendant riots blood had been shed. The
murderers were convicted, but again pardoned and rewarded, and the
anger of the people became still greater. Wilkes's petitions were
neglected, and on his publishing a severe letter against Lord Weymouth,
Secretary of State, the House, instead of leaving the matter to the Law
Courts, declared it a breach of privilege, and unable to pronounce a
libel against a Peer a breach of the privileges of the Commons, they
proceeded, perfectly illegally, to have Wilkes arrested and brought
to the bar of the House, and there tried for libel. Wilkes avowed the
letter, and Lord Barrington, Secretary of War, and one of the "King's
friends," moved his expulsion. A new writ was issued for Middlesex, and
Wilkes was re-elected almost unanimously. The House voted that he could
not sit, and a fresh writ was issued, and Wilkes was again unanimously
elected. Another election was ordered, and this time the Government
contrived to get about three hundred votes for Colonel Luttrell against
eleven hundred given for Wilkes. The House declared that Luttrell was
the member. So iniquitous a decision raised Wilkes into the position
of a great popular leader, and was not carried without many vigorous
protests from the most influential members of the Liberal party. It
tended much to lessen the power of the ministry; both great cities and
great counties held meetings to express their want of confidence in the
present representation and to ask for a dissolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYEIGHT_INCREASE_OF_AMERICAN_DIFFICULTIES" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYEIGHT_INCREASE_OF_AMERICAN_DIFFICULTIES"></a>The difficulties in America.</div>

<p>Nor did the ministry strengthen itself by its dealings with America.
The new imposts of 1767 had been received with great indignation
by the colonists, especially in Massachusetts. There the governor,
Francis Barnard, seems to have been totally destitute of all power
of conciliation. He was backed up by Lord Hillsborough, Colonial
Secretary, scarcely more temperate than himself. The Assembly, in
its quarrel with the governor, issued a circular letter to the other
colonies, calling for their co-operation against the new taxes. They
refused to retract this step at the command of Lord Hillsborough, and
were dissolved. The difficulties of the crisis went on increasing. The
customhouse commissioners were foolish enough to capture and detain an
illicit trader; serious riots were the consequence; the commissioners
were mobbed and their houses robbed. The spirit of resistance spread.
The Society of Sons and Daughters of Liberty, who refused to use imported goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1057" id="Page_1057">[1057]</a></span>
multiplied in other colonies. The view of the Government was not
conciliation, but coercion. Troops and ships of war were crowded into
Boston. In England the feeling was strongly against the Americans.
Coercive measures were recommended and applauded; Francis Barnard was
raised to the rank of a Baronet; the conduct of the people of Boston
gravely censured in Parliament; and at length Bedford's section of the
Whigs produced a motion which could hardly fail to excite resistance.
The Duke moved, and the Parliament applauded his motion, that as it was
probable that American juries would sympathize with their countrymen,
the rioters might be withdrawn from their country, in accordance with
an obsolete law of treason of the reign of Henry VIII. This measure,
which seemed to deprive the colonists of their first rights as
Englishmen, met with deserved execration both at home and in America.
But to crown all, and to put the ministers quite in the wrong, some
general action on their part was wanting. This want was supplied when
the conciliatory efforts of Grafton were defeated in his own Cabinet.
He suggested the removal of all taxation of America. English pride
forbade the Council to accept a measure which they thought derogatory
to the rights of an Imperial nation. Therefore, for the mere purpose
of asserting the right, they agreed to the removal of all taxes but
one, and insisted that the tax on tea should be kept. Thus the original
principle of the right to tax was upheld, and the sting still left to
rankle in the minds of the Americans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters of Junius.</div>

<p>The unpopularity which their conduct had brought on the ministry was
increased by the vigorous and bitter assaults of Junius. This anonymous
writer, probably Sir Philip Francis, lost no opportunity of attacking,
with the greatest animosity, the Duke of Grafton and his supporters,
not even sparing the King, and by his bold assaults, excellent style,
and by the mystery which hung over him, drew upon himself much public
attention, and directed men's minds to all the weaknesses of the
administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of the ministry.</div>

<p>The incompetency of the ministry was indeed becoming obvious. In
the first place it was divided within itself. The Prime Minister, with
the Chancellor and some others, were remnants of the Chatham ministry
and admirers of Chatham's policy. The rest of the Cabinet were either
men who represented Bedford's party, or members of that class whose
views are sufficiently explained by their name, "the King's friends."
Grafton, fonder of hunting and the turf than of politics, had by his
indolence suffered himself to fall under the influence of the
last-named party, and unconstitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1058" id="Page_1058">[1058]</a></span>
action had been the result which had brought discontent in England to
the verge of open outbreak. Hillsborough, under the same influence, was
hurrying along the road which led to the loss of America. On this point
the Prime Minister had found himself in a minority in his own Cabinet.
France too, under Choiseul, in alliance with Spain, was beginning to
think of revenge for the losses of the Seven Years' War. A crisis was
evidently approaching, and the Opposition began to close their ranks.
Chatham, yielding again to the necessities of party, made a public
profession of friendship with Temple and George Grenville; and though
there was no cordial connection, there was external alliance between
the brothers and the old Whigs under Rockingham. In the first session
of 1770 the storm broke. Notwithstanding the state of public affairs,
the chief topic of the King's speech was the murrain among "horned
beasts,"&mdash;a speech not of a king, but, said Junius, of "a ruined
grazier." Chatham at once moved an amendment when the address in answer
to this speech was proposed. He deplored the want of all European
alliances, the fruit of our desertion of our allies at the Peace of
Paris; he blamed the conduct of the ministry with regard to America,
which, he thought, needed much gentle handling, inveighed strongly
against the action of the Lower House in the case of Wilkes, and ended
by moving that that action should at once be taken into consideration.
At the sound of their old leader's voice his followers in the Cabinet
could no longer be silent. Camden declared he had been a most unwilling
party to the persecution of Wilkes, and though retaining the Seals,
attacked and voted against the ministry. In the Lower House, Granby,
one of the most popular men in England, followed the same course. James
Grenville and Dunning, the Solicitor-General, also resigned. Chatham's
motion was lost, but was followed up by
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTY_CAMDEN_AND_GRAFTON" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTY_CAMDEN_AND_GRAFTON"></a>Camden, Granby and Grafton resign.</span>
Rockingham, who asked for a night to consider the state of the nation.
Grafton found it nearly impossible to prop up his falling ministry; the
Great Seal went, as Lord Shelburne said, a-begging. Charles Yorke was
indeed induced to take it in spite of his former political connections,
but, overwhelmed apparently by the coldness of his former friends, he
committed suicide. Grafton thus found himself in no state to meet the
Opposition, and in his heart still admiring Chatham, and much disliking
business, he suddenly and unexpectedly gave in his resignation the very
day fixed for Rockingham's motion.</p>

<p>The Opposition seemed to have everything in their own hands,
but there was no real cordiality between the two sections. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1059" id="Page_1059">[1059]</a></span>
Rockingham party despised the City friends of Chatham, who, under <span
class="sidenote">Want of cordial alliance among the Opposition.</span>
the leadership of Lord Mayor Beckford, had become prominent in the
Wilkite riots, and since that time by a somewhat impertinent use of
the right which the City possessed of directly approaching the King
with petitions. They dreaded also the paramount influence the Grenville
party were nearly sure to possess in any joint Government. On the other
hand, Chatham despised the half measures and moderation constantly
advocated by the Rockingham party. The King, with much quickness and
decision, took advantage of this disunion. To him it was of paramount
importance to retain his friends in office, and to avoid a new
Parliament elected in the present excited state of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King sends for Lord North and avoids a
dissolution.</div>

<p>There was only one of the late ministry capable of assuming the
position of Prime Minister. This was Lord North, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and to him the King immediately and successfully applied,
so that while the different sections of the Opposition were still
unable to decide on any united action, they were astonished to find
the old ministry reconstituted and their opportunity gone. The new
Prime Minister was a man whose unwieldy person and want of grace seemed
little to fit him for the command of a popular assembly. His frame was
bulky, his action very awkward, and his shortsighted, protruding eyes,
swollen cheeks and over-large tongue, enabled Walpole to compare him
to a blind trumpeter. But under this awkward exterior he had great
capacity for business and administration, and much sound sense; he
was a first-rate debater, and gifted with a wonderful sweetness of
temper, which enabled him to listen unmoved, or even to sleep, during
the most violent attacks upon himself, and to turn aside the bitterest
invectives with a happy joke. With his accession to the Premiership
the unstable character of the Government ceased. Resting on the King,
making himself no more than an instrument of the King's will, and thus
commanding the support of all royal influence, from whatever source
derived, North was able to bid defiance to all enemies, till the ill
effects of such a system of government and of the King's policy became
so evident, that the clamour for a really responsible minister grew too
loud to be disregarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triumph of the King's policy.</div>

<p>Thus is closed the great constitutional struggle of the early
part of the reign&mdash;the struggle of the King, supported by the
unrepresented masses, and the more liberal and independent of those who
were represented, against the domination of the House of Commons.
It was an attempt to break those trammels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1060" id="Page_1060">[1060]</a></span>
which, under the guise of liberty, the upper classes, the great lords
and landed aristocracy, had succeeded after the Revolution in laying on
both Crown and people. In that struggle the King had been victorious.
But he did not recognize the alliance which had enabled him to succeed.
He did not understand that the people had other objects much beyond
his own. He saw that they felt thus far with him, that they disliked
the comparative servitude in which he was placed, that they felt hurt
at the coercion frequently brought to bear upon him by the dominant
faction, that they were willing and anxious to assist him in breaking
those ties of party, which were little else than the ties of faction
and class. Seeing this, he did not recognize that the people were
equally disinclined for the establishment of personal government,
that they wanted to strengthen the Crown and to weaken the Whig
party, chiefly as a means of attaining to a more complete system of
self-government. He believed that his own power and his own skill had
been chiefly instrumental in the success which had met his efforts.
He had no intention of allowing any of the fruits of that success to
fall to any but himself. Kind-hearted and well-meaning, he wished to
govern for the good of his people, but he distinctly wished to govern
for them and not to let them govern for themselves. It is thus that
during the ministry of North, and of those who preceded him, the royal
influence was constantly employed in repression,&mdash;repression of
all popular movements at home, repression of all attempts at liberty in
the colonies; and this principle Lord North, backed by a servile House
of Commons, was able to uphold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grenville's reform of election petitions.
1770.</div>

<p>The House was indeed notoriously under ministerial influence, and
one of the last acts of Grenville was to attempt a reform in one
particular at least. Disputed elections had hitherto been referred
to a Committee of the whole House, and had thus become the merest
party questions, in which the right and wrong of the case was
never thought of. Grenville's measure, which was carried against
considerable opposition, gave the cognizance of such questions to
a select Committee, with judicial powers, and themselves bound by
oath. Even thus justice was not secured, and though the number of the
Committee was subsequently again decreased and fresh measures taken to
secure fair decisions, it has lately been found necessary to put the
settlement of election petitions into the hands of some of the regular
judges. This important measure closed the career of Grenville; before
the year was out he died. Thus Lord North found himself relieved from an able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1061" id="Page_1061">[1061]</a></span>
opponent, while the Opposition lost one of its chiefs, and became still
more disorganized. About the same time the death of the Marquis of
Granby, who by his popularity had formed a link between Chatham's party
and the rest of the Opposition, still further weakened that body, and
left North with comparatively easy work on his hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased irritation in America.</div>



<p>It was the American question which still pressed for solution.
Profound anger had been aroused by Bedford's vindictive proposal, and
by the maintenance even in a single instance of the right to tax.
Hitherto the quarrel had been principally with the New Englanders,
but a more general opposition was evidently approaching when the
aristocratic province of Virginia came forward to take the lead. When a
solemn demand in the House of Burgesses for the repeal of the obnoxious
measures of the English Parliament had only produced a dissolution of
the House by the Governor, Lord Bottetort, an organized opposition
was formed by men who subsequently became the chief actors in the War
of Independence. A declaration, signed by Washington, Patrick Henry,
Randolph and Jefferson, was issued against importing British goods till
the restrictions of 1767 had been withdrawn. In Massachusetts the cry
against the troops and the King's ships was continued, and there too
the legislative assembly was prorogued. The complaint made against the
number of soldiers kept in the province, and the consequent danger of
collision, was not groundless. On the 5th of March a riot took place;
and though Captain Preston, who commanded the soldiers, gave no orders
to fire, the troops were unable to command their temper, and some blood
was shed. This "massacre," as it was called, did much still further to
embitter the feelings of the people of Boston. It is pleasant to see
that even amidst the wild political excitement Preston and his soldiers
got a fair trial, and, being defended by John Adams (afterwards
President), were <span class="sidenote">Lord North upholds Lord Hillsborough's
policy.</span> acquitted. This fray happened the very day that Lord
North in England announced his determination of clinging to the policy
of Lord Hillsborough, and said he was ready to remove all taxes except
that on tea. In vain was it pointed out to him that the value of the
tax was little more than £300 a year, and that the Americans had
now made up their minds on the principle, and did not care for the
mere lessening of burdens. He persisted in his view, saying that the
Americans deserved no indulgence, and his motion was supported in the
House, by 204 against 142. For a brief space the American question seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1062" id="Page_1062">[1062]</a></span>
settled. Massachusetts and Virginia still continued loud in their
expressions of discontent, but in most parts of the continent the
question now seemed rather a small one, and the hostile measures
against English trade were generally disregarded.</p>

<p>This period of quiet lasted about three years, during which the
ministry of Lord North constantly acquired strength, though there
were not wanting signs of the great faults which characterized its
policy. In the affair of the Falkland Islands, indeed, in spite of
the outcries of the Opposition, there seems to have been no real lack
either of prudence or firmness. These desert islands had been occupied by
<span class="sidenote">Affair of the Falkland Islands.</span>
the English as a point of importance in the South Seas. Both French
and Spaniards had turned their attention to them also, and a Spanish
settlement, called Fort Soledad, had been formed on one of the islands.
The English had, however, no idea that their neighbours intended to
dispossess them, when, in June 1770, a force of Spaniards from Buenos
Ayres arrived off Fort Egmont, and obliged the garrison to retire. This
outrage in the midst of peace very nearly plunged the nation into war
with Spain and France; for it was Choiseul who was the instigator of
the difficulty, and the skill of Harris (afterwards Lord Malmesbury),
Chargé d'affaires in Spain, would probably have failed to avert it
had not Madame Dubarry, who had lately gained complete influence
over Louis XV., seized the opportunity to overthrow the minister. On
his fall Madame Dubarry's clique, D'Aiguillon, Terray, and Maupeou,
became paramount in France, and, as might be expected under such
circumstances, that country ceased for a time to have much influence in
European politics.</p>

<p>Though this affair had on the whole been carried through with
success, there had been a certain quantity of opposition in London,
showing the unpopular character of the Government. Murmurs
against the press warrants had been heard, and opposition to them
had been overruled chiefly by Chatham's influence. But the feeling
of discontent broke out in full force the following year. Great
jealousy had always been felt in Parliament as to reports of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYONE_THE_LIBERTY_OF_REPORTING" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYONE_THE_LIBERTY_OF_REPORTING"></a>The liberty of reporting Parliamentary
debates.</span> debates held there, and such meagre accounts as had
been published, from the memory of hearers or other private sources,
had habitually been brought out under some disguise and with an
affectation of secrecy. In 1770 this habit had passed into disuse. The
Commons, already angry with the House of Lords for having excluded
strangers, and indignant that, while the Lords secured secrecy their
own debates were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1063" id="Page_1063">[1063]</a></span>
publicly reported, resolved to enforce the existing orders against some
of the printers of reports. Among others, one Miller was summoned to
be reprimanded. He however refused to come, saying he was a livery-man
of the City. A messenger sent to fetch him was himself apprehended and
taken before the Lord Mayor, Brass Crosby, and Aldermen Oliver and
Wilkes. These magistrates supported the arrest and held the messenger
to bail. The House was very indignant. As the Mayor and Oliver were
members, they justified in their places in Parliament what they had
done, and were committed to the Tower. This was a sign for a renewal of
the riots attending the Wilkite difficulties. Mobs filled the streets,
and Lord North was ill used. The City took up the part of its members,
who lived in prison at the public expense; and although the law courts
held that the City was in the wrong, appearances became so threatening
that the House let the matter quietly drop; and on the prorogation in
May the prisoners were allowed to leave their confinement in triumphal
procession, and the question was not again raised. This secured for
ever the liberty of reporting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord North's ministry gathers strength.</div>

<p>In spite of this victory the popular party in the City was losing
ground, and Wilkes was not the name of power it once had been; while
within the walls of Parliament the ministry was constantly acquiring
strength and the Opposition becoming more and more broken up. Grafton
had again consented to return to office; Lord Sandwich, a follower of
the Duke of Bedford, accepted the Admiralty. Lord Suffolk, the leader
of what was left of Grenville's party, became Secretary of State. The
Opposition was thus reduced to the party of Rockingham and such few
followers as consistently clung to Lord Chatham, but these two sections
could never work well together, and the three Whig propositions of the
year were all lost by want of union. The want of harmony between the
Parliament and the country, and the consequent need of some reform,
had been shown by the late quarrels in the City. Chatham brought in
a Bill with that object, embodying his old plan of increased county
representation. This, as it seemed the only manner of securing an
addition of independent members, and as there was not yet in existence
an important manufacturing and industrial element unrepresented, was
probably the best measure that could have been taken. But it did not
find favour with the Rockingham party, and was put aside. The same fate
attended an effort on the part of the Rockingham party to define the
law of libel, and to give the jury in such cases the right of settling
not only the fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1064" id="Page_1064">[1064]</a></span>
publication, but the character of the libel. Chatham thought that
measure should have been left for him, and a ridiculous struggle
between the two Whig sections in the House was the result. On the
third question, the dissolution of the present Parliament, which had
been the favourite object of all the City opposition and addresses,
Chatham found himself almost alone. While thus all effective opposition
disappeared, Lord North found his chief parliamentary support in his
law officers. Thurlow, his Attorney-General, and Wedderburn, his
Solicitor, afterwards Lord Loughborough, brought&mdash;the one the
weight of great legal knowledge, very strong sense, a wonderful power
of invective, and a determination of character almost brutal; the other
a time-serving readiness and facile elegant eloquence which was always
at the service of his chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTWO_ROYAL_MARRIAGE_LAW" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTWO_ROYAL_MARRIAGE_LAW"></a>Royal Marriage Law. 1772.</div>

<p>Excellent as the King's domestic life was, he did not escape the
family discomforts which so constantly attended the
house of Hanover. Two of his brothers gave him much
displeasure by their marriages. The Duke of Cumberland,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
a man of libertine life, after scandalizing the world by appearing as
defendant in a case of criminal conversation, married Mrs. Horton, a
sister of that Colonel Luttrell who had been forced upon the electors
of Middlesex; while the Duke of Gloucester now declared his marriage
with Lady Waldegrave, an illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole.
To guard against such marriages in future, the Royal Marriage Bill
was passed, which forbids any member of the Royal Family, unless
children of princesses married abroad, to marry before the age of
twenty-five without the King's consent. After that age they must give a
twelvemonth's notice of their intended marriage, which may be completed
unless it be petitioned against by both <span class="sidenote">Fate of
the Queen of Denmark.</span> Houses of Parliament. A more real disgrace
than these marriages was the fate of George's sister, Caroline Matilda,
Queen of Denmark. Her husband was a disgusting and licentious sot,
whose villanous conduct so changed her naturally good disposition,
that it was not found difficult for her enemies to gain credence for a
story which connected her name in a disreputable manner with a certain
Struensee, at that time favourite and Prime Minister in Denmark. This
man, a physician by profession, had acquired absolute control over
the King's mind, and had speedily risen to power. His enemies were of
course numerous, and the opportunity offered them by the Queen's conduct
only too favourable. Struensee and the Queen were suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1065" id="Page_1065">[1065]</a></span>
apprehended by night, and the Queen, after some remonstrance from
King George, allowed to retire to Zell, where she died after a few
years, protesting her innocence. Struensee, however, was executed, and
confessed the crime with which he and the Queen were charged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division of Poland.</div>

<p>From such comparatively trivial matters as royal marriages and
misconduct it is necessary to turn to what forms one of the darkest
passages in the political history of Europe. England, under the
guidance of a ministry bound to support the selfish policy of a King
whose real aim was solely the aggrandizement of the Crown, had held
selfishly aloof from foreign affairs. France had just disgraced the
last capable and vigorous minister she possessed, and lay supine
under the hands of the King's scandalous mistress. So these two
great countries, to their eternal disgrace, looked calmly on while
the Eastern powers, without reason or plea of reason, dismembered an
old kingdom and reduced a noble people to slavery. The institutions
of Poland were very different from those of the rest of Europe,
and such as lent themselves easily to the plans of encroaching
neighbours. Since the failure of the house of Jagellon <span
class="sidenote">Constitution of Poland.</span> (1572) the monarchy had
been elective. So great a prize had naturally attracted the notice of
foreign powers, who sought to secure the advancement of their own interests
by obtaining the election of some favourite candidate of their own.
Faction within the country was the inevitable consequence, and the
arrangements of the constitution made faction permanent. There
was no middle class. The nation had not gone through the same
processes as other Western people. Nobility was easily obtained, and
<span class="sidenote">Its peculiar institutions.</span> each member
of the nobility ranked as the peer of all the rest. Below the ranks
of the nobility came the serfs. Political power, and also most of the
executive, was vested in this wide aristocratical democracy. Usually
delegates of the nobles constituted a governing house. Sometimes the
whole body could, and did, claim the right of legislating. In the
delegates' house one veto could check the progress of any law. If to
this is added that the nation was divided by fierce differences in
religion, it will be seen that no fairer field for foreign intrigue can
be conceived. Nor, in spite of their individual bravery, were the Poles
in a position to withstand force; the nobility still clung to their old
habit of fighting on horseback, so that, at a time when modern warfare
had fairly begun, there was no infantry but such as consisted of serfs.
The strength of the army still consisted in an irregular body of light horse. Well might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1066" id="Page_1066">[1066]</a></span>
the Czarina Catherine say that anything might be had from Poland for
the trouble of picking it up. She had made the experiment. On the
death of Augustus of Saxony, in 1764, Russia had compelled the Poles
to elect a late favourite of the Empress, Stanislas Poniatowsky, and
from the time of his election had in fact treated Poland as her own
property. It had been the hereditary policy of France to withstand
Russian influence in Poland, and during Choiseul's ministry this
policy was continued. The Turks were induced to make a war with
Russia, which, though disastrous to them, no doubt somewhat lengthened
the dying agonies of Poland. The confederates, who opposed in arms
the reigning king and the Russian party, chiefly on the ground that
they had insisted on the rights of the dissidents or dissenters in
opposition to the orthodox Catholics, received constant though secret
help from France. The conduct of Austria also was as yet ambiguous,
and, judging by its natural interests, should have been opposed to
that of Russia. On such hopes the confederates rested. Occasional
success lured them on more rapidly to inevitable ruin. But France was
too far away to give real help. Choiseul fell before the intrigues of
the Dubarry party, and neither nation nor ministry was in a temper or
position to pursue with energy a distant and unselfish policy. On the
other hand, Austria speedily began to see more advantage in joining the
prosperous and rising powers of Eastern Europe than in trying to prop
up against them a falling cause. It became evident that Russia would
soon be absolute master of the kingdom. Frederick of Prussia could not
see such an accession to the power of his dangerous neighbour without
taking some corresponding measures, and as a Prussian army entered and
pillaged ruthlessly all the northern provinces, it became plain that
there existed some understanding between Frederick and the Empress. The
movement of Austrian troops, at first supposed to be friendly to the
confederates, soon proved that Maria Theresa, however grandly she might
write <span class="sidenote">Treaty of Partition.</span>
and speak, had joined in the conspiracy of robbers; and before the
year 1772 was over the treaty made early in the year was declared;
and the necessary concessions were wrung with much violence from the
King and legislature, absolutely unable to assert any will of their
own. The final ratification took place in May 1773. The kingdom was to
be partitioned. Each of the three great neighbours was to receive a
portion somewhat in proportion to its size. Russia got 87,500 square
miles; Austria 62,500; Prussia only 9,465 square
miles, but these containing the best and most industrious part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1067" id="Page_1067">[1067]</a></span>
of the nation. What remained was formed into an hereditary monarchy
in the house of Stanislas. It is fair to say, as an excuse for the
supineness with which England looked on at this vast national crime,
that the best and wisest of her statesmen had systematically directed
their attention to the depression of the house of Bourbon. In the
system of balance of power, as then understood, nothing was regarded as
so likely to prove a check on the power of that house as the increase
of the influence of Russia. Any movement in favour of Poland must have
been in union with France and in opposition to Russia, and would have
tended at first to reverse that action, which was generally regarded
as most consistent with the safety of English interests. In the face
of recent facts (1871), it may be clearly evident that the dangers of
Europe come from the East and not from the West; but it is not fair
to blame statesmen or nations because they did not foresee the French
Revolution and its consequences, nor to throw indiscriminate censure on
the whole system of the balance of power because it has sometimes
<span class="sidenote">Balance of Power.</span> produced disasters.
As long as the social constitution of Europe remains the same as it
has been since the breaking up of the feudal system, as long as the
feeling of nationality survives, in some form or other the balance of
power is a necessary safeguard to national independence. The fictitious
divisions into which Europe has by dynastic influences been forced,
and the maintenance of which has been the chief cause of the disrepute
into which the system of balance has fallen, have disappeared, or
are disappearing, before more natural and truly national divisions;
but until these in their turn give way to some wholly new industrial
organization the undue preponderance of one nation must be an object of
dread to all the rest, and their efforts must be directed, as events
afford opportunity, to diminishing that preponderance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTHREE_ORGANIZED_OPPOSITION_IN_AMERICA" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTHREE_ORGANIZED_OPPOSITION_IN_AMERICA"></a>American affairs. 1773.</div>

<p>It is fair also to say that the ministry had enough upon their
hands already. Although there had been a comparative
cessation of the troubles in America, there had been
many signs that they were by no means over. The more
advanced leaders, indeed, in Massachusetts were too determined in
their views and too skilful as managers of agitation to let the friends
of the English connection, though doubtless considerably the larger
part of the population, carry the day through their inactivity. The
discontent of the colonies had been sedulously kept alive by the skill
and vigour of the leaders of the Opposition party. In the midst of
constant quarrels with their governor, Hutchinson, an American by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1068" id="Page_1068">[1068]</a></span>
birth, the Massachusetts leaders appointed a committee of twenty-one
for the purpose of organizing opposition to the Government.
This step was followed by Virginia, where, in 1773, a corresponding
committee of still wider scope was appointed; and at length two
events occurred which entirely destroyed all hope of a peaceful
accommodation. These incidents were the publication of some letters
of Hutchinson, and an arrangement with the India Company which
had in reality no connection with the quarrel. In June 1773, certain
letters were laid before the House of Representatives of Massachusetts
purporting to be written by Hutchinson, their governor, and his brother-in-law,
Oliver, Lieutenant-Governor. These letters, written in 1767
and the two following years to Whately, the private secretary of
Grenville, were of a private and friendly character. They took a view
favourable to the Government, and stated the opinion of the writer,
that a firm exhibition of authority would best tend to check the colonial
discontent. The letters had been forwarded from England by Dr.
Franklin, who was acting as agent for Massachusetts. As they were
private letters, and Mr. Whately was dead, it is impossible that
Franklin should not have known that they had come into his hands
by unfair means. He had not the least right to use them. Indeed, on
sending them to America he made a stipulation that they should not
be published. Of course such a stipulation in the heat of a political
quarrel was intended to be broken; and they were not only produced
and read, and acknowledged by Hutchinson, but published. Their
effect was very great; it seemed to the Americans as if the English
Government had been urged to all its acts of severity by a party of
traitors among themselves. The House of Representatives at once
addressed the King, warmly demanding the removal of Hutchinson
from his place as governor, since he had, they said, betrayed his
trust, and given private, partial, and false information to Government.
The petition was sent to Lord Dartmouth, who had succeeded Lord
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_DUNNINGS_PETITION_REJECTED" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_DUNNINGS_PETITION_REJECTED"></a>Dunning's petition rejected. 1774.</span>
Hillsborough as Colonial Secretary, by him it was laid
before the King, who referred it to the Privy Council.
The Council, consisting chiefly of "the King's friends,"
met in January 1774. Franklin, as Colonial agent, was present. The
petitioners were represented by Dunning, the great Opposition advocate.
The administration had unwisely given the affair the air of a
Government question by naming Wedderburn, the Solicitor-General,
as Hutchinson's counsel. Dunning contented himself with saying
that the petitioners had no impeachment to make, no facts to prove;
they only appealed to the King's judgment. With most unwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1069" id="Page_1069">[1069]</a></span>
want of reticence, Wedderburn, feeling himself in the presence of a
very favourable audience, gave vent to a furious diatribe against
America, and more especially against Franklin&mdash;a man, he said, to
be shunned by all honest men, from whom men would henceforth hide their
papers; in short, a thief. The Council heard, laughed, and applauded.
Franklin stood unmoved, no muscle showing how much he felt the insult,
but it did not miss its mark. For him from that day no accommodation
was possible, and the brown suit in which he stood was put by, to be
worn again only when the treaty declaring America independent was
signed. The petition, in which a people had expressed their earnest
and passionate feelings, was declared frivolous and vexatious, and
Franklin was removed at once from his office of Deputy Postmaster for
the colonies.</p>

<p>Wedderburn had, no doubt, in his violent invective only expressed
the feeling of most of the English nation; only a few weeks after
the meeting of the Privy Council news had reached England which
was not likely to render the bitterness between the two people less. In
1772 the India Company had come to Parliament demanding a loan.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTWO_THE_INDIA_COMPANY" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTWO_THE_INDIA_COMPANY"></a>The India Company's difficulties. 1772.</span>
Much censure had been thrown on their officers and their manner of
action, and alterations had been insisted on, which placed the Company
very much at the mercy of Government. As a sort of compensation a Bill
was brought in in their favour, by which they were enabled to export
their teas from their London warehouses to the American colonies free
from the English duties, and liable only to the much smaller duty to be
levied in the colony. This measure would allow the India Company to get
rid of a large surplus stock of tea then lying on hand, and would enable
the colonists to buy their tea considerably cheaper. To the colonists
however it bore another aspect. The whole plan seemed to them a scheme
to surprise or bribe them into compliance with the very measure of
taxation they were so strenuously opposing. This belief was supported by
the fact, that all the consignees who were to receive the tea were warm
partisans of England, and was fostered by the whole body of tea merchants
and free traders, who saw themselves likely to be driven from the market
by this direct tea trade. The opposition party took means to organize a
resistance. The consignees were duly warned. The tea ships entered Boston
harbour, but the captains were so fully convinced of the futility of
their speculation, that they would willingly have again withdrawn. Some
little customhouse formalities detained them; and meanwhile they
were boarded by a body of men dressed as Mohawks, who tossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1070" id="Page_1070">[1070]</a></span>
obnoxious tea into the sea. Similar steps, though less violent, were
taken elsewhere, and none of the tea sent over under this disastrous
law found its way into the market.</p>

<p>Such violence, and such contempt of authority, exasperated the
minds of the English people. Lord North seems still to have
inclined to conciliatory measures, but the remnant of the Bedford
party, always particularly bitter against America, was too powerful
for him, especially as the King's opinion, before which North always
yielded with fatal weakness, was thrown into the scale on the side
of severity. Two measures were devised to punish the refractory
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_BOSTON_PORT_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_BOSTON_PORT_BILL"></a>The Boston Port Bill. 1774.</span>
colony. By the first, known as the Boston Port Bill,
the customhouse, and consequently all the trade, was
moved from Boston, and the port was declared closed;
in fact the thriving town was rendered desolate. The warehouses
stood empty, the docks and quays were deserted. Salem was chosen
to take the place of Boston; but so strong was the feeling against
the Bill, that the very merchants of Salem, though the benefit
would have been all theirs, petitioned against it. The anger excited
by the Bill was not confined to Boston; a feeling of indignation
pervaded all the colonies. Their sympathy was soon increased by
<span class="sidenote">Massachusetts government Bill.</span>
fear for their own liberties; for a second Bill was
introduced, abrogating the old charter of Massachusetts.
Its popular constitution was to be destroyed, and the
colony was to become in the strictest sense a Crown colony; the
council was to be named by the Crown instead of by the people;
and the judges, magistrates and sheriffs were to be nominated and
removed by the governor without consulting the council. All the
other colonies naturally felt their charters insecure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crisis of the quarrel.</div>

<p>In fact, all seemed to show that the critical time had come. Attempts
were indeed made subsequently at reconciliation, but they were hollow,
and the proposers of them knew that they were hollow. Henceforward
an appeal to arms became almost certain, and the idea of claiming
independence, as yet only existing in the minds of a few of the leaders,
began to become prevalent. Virginia at once threw in her lot with
Massachusetts. A fast was ordered on account of the Boston Port Act,
and the governor dissolved the assembly. The leaders met at the Raleigh
Tavern, and agreed upon a form of association against trade with England.
Washington, hitherto hopeful of reconciliation, declared his readiness
to raise 1000 men at his own cost for the support of the people of
Massachusetts. In spite of all Government opposition, most of the colonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1071" id="Page_1071">[1071]</a></span>
accepted the lead of Virginia, kept the fast, and agreed to the
association, while, as a chief step in the direction of general revolt,
a Congress was summoned at Philadelphia, and attended by representatives
of the assemblies of twelve colonies, Georgia alone being absent. The
English, too, understood that the two great Bills were little short of a
declaration of war. Hutchinson was recalled, and General Gage was made
Governor of Massachusetts, while Boston was filled with troops. Of course
a quarrel between the new governor and the assembly was inevitable. The
assembly was dissolved, and refusing to disperse, collected and sat at
Concord, constituting thus in fact a rebel government, whose orders were
implicitly obeyed. Gage had been obliged to fortify Boston Neck; as a
counter measure the Concord assembly established a permanent committee
of public safety, organized 12,000 militia, and enrolled <em>minute
men</em>, or picked men from the militia bound to serve at a minute's
notice. While things were thus drifting into war in Massachusetts, the
General Congress issued a Declaration of Rights, setting forth the
rights of the colonists as Englishmen, and declaring that the late Acts
were infractions of these rights, and must be repealed before America
would submit, and passed a resolution forbidding importation
<span class="sidenote">Acts of the General Congress.</span> from England,
the use of imported goods, and after the interval of a year exportation
to England also. These, and other acts and papers of the Congress,
acquired much weight by being to all appearance issued unanimously, an
important advantage which was only gained after a trial of strength,
in which the views of the advanced leaders were carried by a majority
of one. When defeated on a scheme of reconciliation proposed by Mr.
Galloway, and considered as a test question, the minority wisely accepted
their position, and desisted from all protest, so that all the acts of
Congress might have their full weight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General election. Anti-American feeling of the
nation.</div>

<p>A general election in England in September of this year made it
plain that the temper of the people was no less bitter
and determined in the mother country than in the
colonies. A large ministerial majority was returned
ready to support any acts of coercion. The Opposition began by
demanding papers in an amendment on the address, but the real

struggle did not begin till January, when Chatham
again expressed his opinion, moving the immediate
repeal of the obnoxious statutes of the preceding year
and the withdrawal of troops from Boston. The majority against
him was overwhelming; none the less did he at once set to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1072" id="Page_1072">[1072]</a></span>
work, with Franklin's help, to prepare a scheme of reconciliation,
though Franklin had probably neither much hope nor much wish
that it should succeed. It was at first fairly received by Lord
Dartmouth, the Colonial Secretary, but again Lord Sandwich and the
Bedford party overawed their more temperate colleague, and it was
rejected with scorn. The wisdom of some step in the same direction
<span class="sidenote">North's measure for the same purpose.</span> seems
however to have been plain to Lord North, who in a short time produced a
scheme of his own. This did not go further than to say, that so long as
the colonies taxed themselves with the approbation of King and Parliament
no other taxes ought to be laid on them. It was much too late for any
such trumpery measure.</p>

<p>It was indeed too late for any schemes of reconciliation, and the appeal
to arms began. General Gage, who in spite of his representations had
been left without reinforcements during the winter, could not see the
<span class="sidenote">Skirmish at Lexington. April 1775.</span>
preparations made for arming and supplying the militia,
carried on by the provincial Congress, without taking
some measures to prevent them. In April he determined
to destroy the stores at Concord. Some militiamen, who were being
drilled at Lexington, only dispersed after firing upon the troops; and
when the soldiers, after destroying such of the stores as had been left
at Concord, began their homeward march, they found themselves
assaulted from behind every hedge and cover, and were compelled to
seek refuge in a very distressed condition with a body of troops who
had been sent to support them. The English loss was 270, while the
rebels lost less than 100 men. This slight success raised the spirits of
the colonists; militiamen crowded in from all quarters, and General
Gage was blockaded in Boston. The rebels even ventured to attempt an
expedition against the neighbouring province of Canada. A Bill passed
<span class="sidenote">Canada Bill.</span> the preceding year in England
had given a constitution to Canada. This colony, nearly wholly French,
neither understood nor valued English institutions, and was firmly
Roman Catholic in its religion. The constitution was wisely conceived
in a more arbitrary spirit than would have suited Englishmen, and with
great liberality established the Roman Catholic worship. The Americans,
unable to see the wisdom of this, and Puritan in their own religious
beliefs, fancied that Canada must be smarting under its wrongs, and
that they should find hearty sympathy there. In this belief, and to
open the road thither, two New Englanders raised troops on their own
responsibility&mdash;Arnold, a horse dealer, and Ethan Allen&mdash;and
advanced against the forts which held the valley of Lakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1073" id="Page_1073">[1073]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">The second Congress assumes sovereign
authority.</div>

<p>The first question which met the second General Congress was
whether they should take upon themselves the responsibility
of these actions or accept the conciliatory resolution
of Lord North. There was no hesitation on the part of
the Congress. Lord North's proposition was thrown aside at once;
orders were issued against supplying any British force or officer;
a national name was assumed&mdash;<cite>The United Colonies</cite>; coercive
measures were decreed against any province which should refuse
to recognize the authority of Congress; and on the flimsy excuse
of a contemplated invasion from Canada, the actions of Allen
and Arnold were acknowledged, and an attack on Canada organized.
These were acts of rebellion and war, and the Congress, conscious that
the die was cast, proceeded to appoint a commander-in-chief. Their
choice fell upon Colonel Washington, a Virginian gentleman, and
a member of the Congress, who had seen some service in the late
frontier wars, and was much respected by his province. He was a
powerful, somewhat silent man, of very strong sense, and great
powers of self-control, possessing that commanding influence which
<span class="sidenote">Washington chosen commander-in-chief.</span> is
given by strong passion and enthusiasm habitually subdued, but just
visible under a constant and calm exterior. His unquestioned honesty,
his hatred of disorder, and his great simplicity of character, fitted
him well to give dignity to a cause which ran the risk, if it fell into
inferior hands, of degenerating into a selfish and riotous uproar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Bunker's Hill. June 17, 1775.</div>

<p>Washington at once hurried to the seat of war, but before he arrived
another battle had been fought. A narrow channel separates Boston from
another town of the name of Charlestown, behind which rise two masses of
high ground, known as Breed's and Bunker's Hill, from which Boston is
commanded. Breed's Hill is the nearer of the two to Boston. It was
natural to suppose that General Gage, whose forces had been raised to
10,000 men by reinforcements under Generals Clinton, Howe and
Burgoyne, would assume the offensive, and at all events try to secure
these hills. The Americans attempted to forestall him, and some
rude defences were thrown up on the ridge of Breed's Hill. About
2000 English were sent to dislodge them. The Americans fought
well, more than once the English drew back before their fire, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1074" id="Page_1074">[1074]</a></span>
rallied by Clinton, they eventually took the position, driving the
enemy, more than twice their number, in disorder along Charlestown
Neck, where they were open to the fire of our ships. More than 800
of the English fell in the desperate struggle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of the American army.</div>

<p>Although the insurgent troops were justly proud of the gallant stand
they had made against disciplined forces, the army when Washington
joined it was not such as a general would wish to command. Even in the
late battle well authenticated cases of cowardice had occurred among
the officers. The militia regiments of the various states regarded each
other with jealous eyes; there was no sort of uniformity of dress, no
trace of soldierly bearing; the soldiers showed little subordination to
officers scarcely better than themselves; and, worse than all, there was
a fearful deficiency of powder. It taxed the ability and temper of their
new general to the full to bring the motley crowd into order. He exacted
the sternest discipline, drew a sharp line between the officers and men,
procured hunting shirts to supply the lack of uniform, and by unremitting
toil gradually produced a tolerable army. Why General Gage looked quietly
on while this process was being carried out it is difficult to say. Even
setting aside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1075" id="Page_1075">[1075]</a></span>
lack of ammunition, of which however he was fully informed, he had
troops enough to have destroyed the enemy which were blockading
him without difficulty, and might thus perhaps have ended the war
at a blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Olive Branch Petition.</div>

<p>The slowness which characterizes the English generals at the
beginning of the war is probably to be traced to the prevalent idea
that reconciliation was still possible, and that the terrible extremity
of civil war might be avoided. Even at this very time the Congress was
sending to the King a last appeal; but this document, known as the Olive
Branch Petition, was not received in England. There was a technical
objection to it which secured its rejection; it purported to come from
the Congress&mdash;an illegal and unrecognized body. The Americans
could scarcely indeed have expected that it would have produced any
effect. It held out no hope of concession, but expressed only vague
wishes for reconciliation. It probably served the turn of those who
sent it by allowing them to throw the blame of the future war entirely
on the English. It might have been wise on the part of the ministry,
even thus late, to have accepted overtures of peace, but it would have
been a stretch of wisdom which no man had a right to expect; for the
Congress had undoubtedly by its action assumed a position of complete
independence and hostility which a Government could scarcely be expected
to overlook.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack on Canada.</div>

<p>Even before the Olive Branch was sent the Congress had determined
to take advantage of the successes of the preceding year, and had
organized, under Generals Montgomery and Arnold, an attack upon Canada,
which General Carleton was ill prepared to repel with less than 1000
British troops. While Montgomery crossed Lake Champlain and pushed on to
Montreal, Arnold, with incredible labour, had made his way up the valley
of the Kennebec, and so down the Chaudière, to Quebec. Unable to prevent
the junction of the armies, Carleton hastened to throw himself into the
capital, and upon the Heights of Abraham succeeded in checking their
advance, with the loss of Montgomery their leader. Arnold could do no
more than keep up a nominal blockade, so ably was the defence conducted,
and the general who superseded him, meeting with no sympathy from the
Canadians, was forced to withdraw in disorder beyond Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dilatory conduct of Gage, who had now been
succeeded by General Howe, had lost Boston to the English.
Washington had at length found himself strong enough to take and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1076" id="Page_1076">[1076]</a></span>
fortify the Dorchester Heights, which commanded the English lines on
Boston Neck. A general engagement, which could scarcely have

otherwise than favourably to the English, would have still rendered
the town tenable, and Howe was inclined to bring on a battle. But a
continued course of bad weather frustrated his plans, and thinking
that for military reasons New York, where the royal party was strong,
would make a better base of operations, he determined to withdraw; he
accordingly removed all his troops to Halifax, there to await promised
reinforcements. So long were the fresh troops in coming that Howe had
to leave Halifax without them. There was considerable difficulty in
supplying him. The military arrangements of England have been constantly
found inefficient at the opening of a war; it was only by purchasing
troops at an exorbitant price from the Duke of Brunswick and the
Landgrave of Hesse that the immediate want could be supplied. It was
therefore only on a limited scale that Howe was enabled to carry out that
plan for the arrangement of the troops which was afterwards continued
during the war; and which consisted of making New York the centre of
operations, to be supported by two subsidiary forces, the one acting in
the Southern States, the other from Canada. In pursuance of this plan,
he despatched a force against Charleston, in Carolina, under General
Clinton, while he himself moved to Sandy Hook, thus threatening New
York, whither Washington had hastened from Boston. He was there joined
in July by his brother, Admiral Lord Howe, and found himself, with his
reinforcements and with the troops which had been sent to Charleston and
had returned upon the failure of the expedition, at the head of nearly
30,000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh offers of conciliation rejected.</div>

<p>Lord Howe brought with him full powers for himself and his
brother the general, empowering them, in accordance
with a late Act of Parliament, to receive the submission
of any colony, and after such submission to grant pardon
and redress. An Imperial nation, defied by its colonies and not yet
beaten, could hardly offer more, and to those not thoroughly conversant
with what was going on in America, it must have seemed that
there was every chance of such terms being accepted. Never as yet
had the chances of the insurgents seemed so small. It is true that
the revolt had become universal; but the spirit of the commercial
population of the Northern States was severely tried, and seemed to
be yielding under the depression of trade caused by the war. The
English army was for the time actually more numerous than that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1077" id="Page_1077">[1077]</a></span>
Washington, whose troops, nominally but 27,000 strong, were diminished
by illness or absence. Those who remained were in a miserable
condition, and consisted chiefly of men enlisted for short periods, who
could scarcely be properly drilled before they returned to their
homes. But the state of feeling was no longer what it had been. It
was no longer a question of pardon or redress. The more earnest and
violent men had, as is usual in civil commotions, been coming more
and more to the front. The idea of a total separation from England
had been rapidly gaining ground; republican and democratic
principles had made their appearance; the writings of Thomas
Paine had been published, and so largely were his views received,
that a declaration, issued by the aristocratic State of Virginia, served
afterwards as the model for the Declaration of the Rights of Man
issued by the revolutionists of France; and already, before the
arrival of Howe with his offer of pardon, the extreme party had
determined to check all lukewarmness and put an end to all chance
of reconciliation by taking an irretrievable step. In June, Lee of
Virginia proposed in Congress that the colonies should declare
<span class="sidenote">Declaration of Independence. July 4, 1776.</span>
themselves independent. The numbers on division proved to be exactly
equal, but Dickinson, the writer of the "Pennsylvanian Farmer's Letters,"
and the leader of the moderate party, consented to withdraw, and the
motion for independence was thus carried by a majority of one. The
document itself is not a very powerful one, but shows how abstract
political views had become mingled with the original questions in
dispute. It is based on the Declaration of Virginia, recapitulates
all the real or fancied grievances of the colonies, and, with curious
political dishonesty, attributes them all to the personal tyranny of
the King. The Declaration of Independence, issued on July 4th, reached
Washington's army just before Lord Howe's arrival; it of course rendered
his pacific mission fruitless. The colonies had assumed the position of
an independent nation, and claimed to be treated with all the respect
due to such a position. Howe's letters to Washington were even returned
unopened, because they were not addressed to him by his full military
style and title.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Brooklyn. Aug. 27.</div>

<p>To the English nothing now remained but to take advantage of
the superiority of their troops. An attack upon the lines
of Brooklyn, at the end of Long Island, separated from
New York only by a narrow channel, was ordered. The
Americans, in about equal numbers, came out of their intrenchments,
and for the first time during the war a battle was fought in the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1079" id="Page_1079">[1079]</a></span>
field. The victory of the English troops was immediate and complete.
It was due only to Howe's want of vigour in pressing his success
that Washington was able to withdraw his army to New York,
whence, finding it impossible to hold his ground, he retired ultimately
to the mainland, taking up a position at Kingsbridge, and leaving the
city in the hands of the English. It was plain that the temporary
militia of the colonists was useless against regular troops, and in
spite of its republican dread of a standing army, the Congress at
length listened to Washington's repeated representations, and authorized
the enrolment of some regular troops. But for more than
a year he was compelled to do his best with his old militia, and
nothing but the continued and incomprehensible slowness of the
English generals saved him from disaster. Step by step he was
driven backwards, till he was compelled to cross the Delaware and
leave the whole of the Jerseys in the hands of the English. The road
to Philadelphia seemed open, and the Congress, in fear, withdrew to
Baltimore. But the English, when they found that all the boats on
the Delaware had been removed, quietly withdrew into winter
quarters upon a very extended line, and waited in hopes of being
able to cross the river on the ice. The time thus wasted lost
them all the advantages they had won, and gave Washington an
opportunity to recover. Eager to strike some blow which should
raise the spirits of the colonists and enable him to fill the ranks of
the army, he determined to take advantage of the weak and extended
line of the English. On Christmas evening, trusting to the effects of
the day's debauch, he crossed the river, and surprised and captured
the garrison of Trenton. Cornwallis, who had the command of the
advanced troops of the English, came to the rescue, but Washington
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSEVEN_WASHINGTON_RECOVERS_NEW_JERSEY" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSEVEN_WASHINGTON_RECOVERS_NEW_JERSEY"></a>Washington recovers New Jersey. Jan. 3,

captured or destroyed two regiments at Princeton. He was unable to
secure, as he had intended, the supplies at Gloucester, but before long
he succeeded in clearing New Jersey of the English, and confining them,
as before, to New York and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Howe remained idle till June, thus allowing much time to the
Americans, to whom time was everything. But in June preparations
<span class="sidenote">Threefold plan of the English.</span>
for a great joint movement were matured. Not only was the main army in
New York again to resume the offensive, but advantage was to be taken of
the possession of Canada, and an attack organized from that country. This
branch of the combined movement was placed under the command of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1080" id="Page_1080">[1080]</a></span>
Burgoyne. The cleft made by the valley of the Hudson is continued
northward by the Lakes George and Champlain, and a natural road thus
formed from Canada to New York. Down this the Canadian army was to march,
assisted by the co-operation of Clinton, who was to lead troops from New
York to meet it. Thus the disaffected provinces of New England would be
severed from the rest of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Howe's expedition against Philadelphia. Sept.
1777.</div>

<p>Howe's army, which was now comparatively powerful, was expected to
make its way through the Jerseys, and to complete the project of last
autumn by capturing Philadelphia; but, finding Washington ready to oppose
his advance, he suddenly withdrew his troops and embarked them in the
fleet. He appeared for a moment off the mouth of the Delaware, but again,
finding more obstacles than he had expected, took to the sea, and
sailing all round the promontory between the Delaware and the Bay
of Chesapeake, ultimately arrived at the top of that piece of water at
the Head of Elk, nearly as far from Philadelphia as when he started.
The time spent in making this long circuit enabled Washington to
be fully prepared to cover Philadelphia. He took up his position
in Brandywine Creek. He was there quite outman&oelig;uvred. While
one division of the English held the ground in front, another marched
round and fell upon the rear and left flank, and completely routed
his army. He still tried to hold the line of the Schuylkill, but it
was passed by the English with little difficulty, and Philadelphia
occupied. The capital was thus in the hands of the English, but the
expeditionary character of the attack prevented it from being so
effectual as a steady advance would have been, while it rendered the
conquest nugatory by separating it entirely from New York, the
real basis of operations. In some degree to correct this error, it
became necessary to secure direct access by sea by the capture of
the forts which held the mouth of the Delaware. For this purpose
the English army was divided, one portion remained at Germanstown
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Germanstown. Oct. 4.</span> to hold
Philadelphia, and the rest were moved to the siege of the forts.
Washington took advantage of the weakness of his immediate opponents and
attacked the troops at Germanstown. At first he was successful, but a
panic, such as not unfrequently seizes young and half-disciplined troops,
changed his half-won victory to defeat. The forts of the Delaware were at
length captured, and the operations of the English seemed to have been
thoroughly successful.</p>

<p>It was indeed a moment of intense depression in the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1081" id="Page_1081">[1081]</a></span>
army; nothing but the extraordinary patience and steadfastness
<span class="sidenote">Washington reorganizes the army.</span> of
Washington could have saved it. Half-disciplined troops, many of them
inclined to desert, or to leave their standards as soon as their short
time of enlistment was over, thousands without shoes, a commissariat
ridiculously incompetent and notoriously fraudulent, a civil power
inclined to meddle and complain of the military arrangements, such were
some of the difficulties with which he had to contend. He managed in
spite of all to keep his army together, and to induce his troops to go
into winter quarters at Valley Forge, a wild but strong position among
the hills on the Schuylkill river a little above Philadelphia. News from
the North came to cheer him in his distressed condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne's disasters.</div>

<p>Though successful in itself, the real object of Howe's expedition had
not been obtained, it had not enabled the army of New York to go to the
assistance of Burgoyne, and that general had been compelled to surrender
with all his army on the 17th of October. In June he had advanced
along the west side of Lake Champlain, and had taken the fortress of
Ticonderoga, Fort Anne, and Fort Edward on the Hudson. Hearing that the
Americans had supplies but slightly guarded at Bennington, on the road to
the Connecticut river, he sent a small detachment to secure them. This
was the beginning of his misfortunes; the difficulties proved greater
than was expected, the expedition failed and had to retire in haste, with
the loss of all its artillery. However, trusting to the co-operation of
the army from New York, and of a force which was to make its way from the
great lakes by Fort Stanwix down the upper Hudson and join him before
Albany, Burgoyne continued to advance. He collected thirty days' supplies
and crossed the Hudson, thus cutting himself off from Canada, and relying
for safety upon his power of opening communication with New York. The
militia of the neighbouring district at once rose behind him, thus
completely severing his communications. His Indian auxiliaries had left
him; he could not rely much on his Canadian troops, and now found himself
in face of General Schuyler with 16,000 men. The help on which he had
calculated did not come, Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger failed before Fort
Stanwix, and Clinton was unable to leave New York. Burgoyne attempted
an assault on the American position before Behmus's Heights, north of
Stillwater, but failed. To advance seemed impossible, he therefore
ordered a retreat, though this was scarcely less difficult. He had told
Clinton that he could hold out till the 12th of October,
and when that day came he was still close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1082" id="Page_1082">[1082]</a></span>
Saratoga, and now neither retreat nor advance was possible. His boats
upon the lake, which afforded him his sole means of procuring supplies
or of transport, had been destroyed; he had no choice but to make some
sort of surrender. On the 17th of October a convention was signed by
which he surrendered his whole force to General Gates, who had assumed
the chief command of the American troops. His army was allowed to march
out of camp with the honours of war to the bank of the river, there to
lay down their arms, and to be forwarded to England, under promise not
to serve again during the war. Though the reception of the prisoners by
both generals and men was most generous, and though Burgoyne lived as a
guest in General Schuyler's house, the terms of the convention were not
honestly fulfilled; Burgoyne, indeed, was allowed to return to England,
but the main part of the army was detained in America for several years.
The blame of this breach of treaty is held to attach to Congress only,
and not to Washington.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSIX_EFFECT_OF_AMERICAN_AFFIARS" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSIX_EFFECT_OF_AMERICAN_AFFIARS"></a>Effect of American affairs on the Parliament. Oct.
1776.</div>

<p>The autumn session of 1776 had been opened with a speech full of the
successes of the English arms. The battle of Brooklyn, the fall of New
York, the expulsion of the invaders from Canada, were all topics of
congratulation. The feeling of the nation went with the Government, and
the opposition in Parliament dwindled to a very small minority; but in
spite of their weakness they continued to urge conciliatory measures,
and at the beginning of the session, both in the Upper and Lower House,
amendments in that sense were moved to the address. So plain was it,
however, that such efforts were wholly useless, that Lord Rockingham's
party ostentatiously retired from all public questions, attending the
House only during private business. Fox indeed, who had left the ministry
in 1773, and had become the foremost champion of the American cause,
remained in his place, but the rest of the party did not reappear, till,
finding their step worse than useless, they took the opportunity of a
debate upon the Civil List to return to public life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSEVEN_INCREASE_OF_THE_CIVIL_LIST" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYSEVEN_INCREASE_OF_THE_CIVIL_LIST"></a>Increase of the Civil List.</div>

<p>This debate arose on a demand for an increase to the Civil List of
£100,000 a year, and £600,000 to pay off the debts already owing. Under
the existing circumstances the necessity for the measure was obvious,
for the King's ordinary tradesmen were unpaid, and his servants' wages
in arrears. The Civil List already amounted to £800,000 a year, and the
known personal frugality of the King and Queen rendered the disappearance
of so large a sum the more scandalous. In fact, nearly £600,000 had been spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1083" id="Page_1083">[1083]</a></span>
since 1769 in secret service. It was easy to explain the insufficiency
of the Civil List and the permanence of the ministerial majority in
Parliament; not only had the Pension List been largely increased, but
there were a swarm of sinecure officers about the Court, from grand
falconers in the House of Peers to turnspits of the kitchen who sat in
the House of Commons. The Civil List was increased, but the grant was
accompanied by a strong expression, on the part of Sir Norton Fletcher,
of the feeling of the House, that under the existing pressure of taxation
such extravagant use of public money was much to be blamed,&mdash;words
which were subsequently formally accepted by the House as their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chatham's motion. May 30, 1777.</div>

<p>The session closed with another effort on the part of the Opposition.
On this occasion it was Lord Chatham who led the attack. He returned,
after two years of illness, and still swathed in flannel, to move an
address, urging the King to arrest the misfortunes in America. The
measures he advised were unconditional redress of grievances, and repeal
of all penal statutes; in other words, he would have granted all the
demands of the Americans with the exception of their independence. But,
while urging moderate counsels with regard to America, he blazed out at
the idea of an alliance of the colonists with the French, and demanded
instant war. <span class="sidenote">American intrigues with France.</span>
His motion was of course lost. His fears of an alliance with
France were not however unfounded; already, before the Declaration of
Independence, Silas Deane had been sent over to Europe to try and make
some arrangement. If the confession of the culprit is to be believed,
Deane's handiwork was to be seen in the nefarious plans of a man called
John the Painter, who in the December of the preceding year (1776) had
attempted to fire the dockyards of Portsmouth. Again, immediately after
the Declaration of Independence, Adams and Franklin had been sent over
as accredited agents to make a commercial and defensive alliance with
France. But though they had been well received both by the ministry and
by the salons of Paris, where for the time Franklin was the fashion,
their representations were mistrusted, and no real help was given. The
French had no wish to engage in a failing cause, and continued to keep
up an appearance of friendship with England, even, at the instigation
of our ambassador, issuing, though probably intentionally too late, a
<i>lettre de cachet</i> to stop the Marquis of Lafayette from sailing to join
the colonists. He had no difficulty in avoiding it, and was present with
Washington during the Philadelphian
campaign. But the Court of France was in fact only watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1084" id="Page_1084">[1084]</a></span>
the turn of events. The news of the defeat of Burgoyne had scarcely

Dec. 1777.</span> reached Europe before the independence of America was
acknowledged and a commercial treaty made. In case of France becoming
involved in the war with England, this treaty was to be extended into
one by which France engaged to supply military assistance on the sole
condition that America should never acknowledge the supremacy of Great
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chatham's energy in Parliament. Nov. 20, 1777.</div>

<p>Already, by the time of the meeting of Parliament for the autumn
session, rumours of Burgoyne's difficulties had reached England, though
no news of his final disaster had arrived. The danger of war with France,
to which Chatham had alluded in the spring, seemed to increase, and men's
thoughts began to turn towards the great statesman who had before saved
England in similar difficulties. Nor did Chatham refuse to respond to the
general expectation; not for many years had he shown
such activity as in this session. In moving an amendment on the
address, he demanded the withdrawal of all troops from America,
stigmatized with due severity the employment of savage Indians in
the war, and strove to rouse the national spirit against France.
But the energy and eloquence he exhibited throughout the session
were unavailing. He consistently upheld the view that conquest of
America was quite impossible, that it was worse than useless to
carry on the war, and that all the demands of the colonists should be
granted with the exception of independence. This, he said in the
strongest words, it was impossible for England to grant. He relied,
no doubt, on the natural hostility between the colonists and France,
and it is possible that, had he been placed in office, his policy might
have been successful. He was loved and trusted by the Americans;
concessions from his hands might have been received. He was
feared by France; his plan of removing the troops from America
would have left the resources of England free for a foreign war; his
threats and his name might have deterred the French from war.
But certainly no other man could carry out such a policy, and so it
was generally felt; North himself acknowledged the impossibility,
and was most desirous of resigning; Lord George Germaine, who,
disgraced at Minden as a military man, had become as member of the
Government the chief supporter of repressive measures in America, was
also preparing to give up his post. The ministry seemed on the point
of giving way, and indeed the necessity for such a step was increasing
rapidly. Early in December came the terrible news of Saratoga,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1085" id="Page_1085">[1085]</a></span>
and three weeks later the preliminaries of the treaty between France
and the colonies were agreed upon, though the French ministry
had not scrupled to cover their intentions by false statements on the
matter.</p>

<p>The Opposition began to feel triumphant. Though still quite outvoted
in the House, they knew that the majority turned with the ministry,
whatever it might be; but they did not sufficiently reckon on the King's
obstinacy. He had been right in his boast at the beginning of his reign;
he was thoroughly English; he reflected and sympathized with the most
vulgar feelings and prejudices of the people. The disasters in America
had called out considerable enthusiasm in England; money had been largely
subscribed for keeping up more troops, and the temper of the nation was
evidently <span class="sidenote">The King insists on Lord North retaining
office.</span> for pressing the war with energy, regardless of
consequences. In vain did Lord North express his desire to resign, and
declare the necessity of conciliatory measures. The King, strong in
the popular feeling, reproached him for intending to desert him, as he
called it. On further pressure he gave him leave to apply to Chatham
and the Whigs, but only on the absurd condition, that they should join
the present ministry, serve under Lord North, and carry out the same
policy as the existing Government. He would not hear of the ministry
being put frankly into Chatham's hands. As usual, Lord North yielded,
and consented to stay in office. He even consented to bring in bills
absolutely reversing all his own policy, and which could have come with
good grace only from the Opposition. His Conciliation Bill, now in the
hands of the ministry, was carried without difficulty, and all <span
class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYEIGHT_NORTHS_CONCILIATION_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYEIGHT_NORTHS_CONCILIATION_BILL"></a>Lord North's Conciliation Bill.</span> American demands,
short of independence, were granted; all officers appointed by Congress
acknowledged, and commissioners, with the most ample powers to discuss
and arrange all points of quarrel, appointed. North still wished that, as
this was in fact the Opposition policy, the Opposition should have the
duty of putting it into effect; but the King and the course of events
were too strong for him. The Conciliation Bill had hardly
<span class="sidenote">Rupture with France.</span> passed when an open
rupture with France took place. The treaty concluded on the 6th of
February was notified in insulting terms to the English Court. Such a
treaty was followed by the inevitable withdrawal of ambassadors, and war
with France was in fact upon us.</p>

<p>To the Opposition it seemed as if the play had been played out.
They were inclined for immediate submission. If England could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1086" id="Page_1086">[1086]</a></span>
conquer America alone, what hope was there of conquering America
joined with France with the whole house of Bourbon in its wake?
They urged the immediate recognition of the independence of the
colonies. Such, as has been before explained, were not the views of
Chatham; his spirit rose with the idea of war with his old enemy,
and he relied on his own ability, not indeed to conquer, but to conciliate
America while he crushed France. His plan was never put
to the test. On the 7th of April the Duke of Richmond moved in the
House of Lords that all troops should at once be withdrawn from
America, and a peace concluded, which of course implied the
independence of the contracting parties. Chatham, very weak and
ill, and against the advice of his friends, went down on purpose to
oppose the motion. Scarcely able to walk, his feeble steps were supported
by his son William and his son-in-law Lord Mahon. After
hearing the Duke of Richmond's motion, he rose with difficulty, and
resting on his crutch, and with his eyes looking unnaturally vivid in his
shrunk face and under his great wig, he proceeded to make a vigorous
reply. His voice was very low, and at times his memory failed, but
here and there his eloquence rose to its old pitch, and he again thrilled
his hearers as he recounted the dangers which England had outlived,
and demanded whether the country which but seventeen years ago
was the terror of the world "was to stoop so low as to tell its ancient
inveterate enemy, Take all we have, only give us peace." The Duke
replied in a weak speech; and Chatham rose again, eager to answer
him, but before he could speak he was seen to gasp, to lay his hand
<span class="sidenote">Death of Lord Chatham. May 11, 1778.</span>
upon his heart, and to sink back, apparently dying. The death of this
greatest of English statesmen put an end to all hope of a new policy.
Unless the Americans received the conciliatory measures of Lord North
well&mdash;which was most unlikely&mdash;the war must be fought out.
Every honour was paid to the memory of Chatham. He was voted a public
funeral in Westminster Abbey, and a monument, which is placed over the
door at the west end of the Abbey, and represents him with his arm
raised in the act of speaking. His debts were paid and a large pension
settled on his family. Four Lords protested against these honours and the
ministerial people kept chiefly aloof from his funeral. But the feeling
of regret and admiration was universal. The Duke of Richmond's motion was
of course negatived, and it remained to be seen what the Commissioners
could do.</p>

<p>Before that question could be answered a subject was brought
before the notice of Parliament and nation which was destined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1087" id="Page_1087">[1087]</a></span>
play an important part and to take the place of the American contest
as a party test. This was the question of Catholic relief. The
laws still existing against the members of the Roman Catholic religion
<span class="sidenote">Laws against Roman Catholics repealed.</span> were
most severe in character. They had been enacted chiefly in the reign of
William III., when England was still in mortal terror of the restoration
of the malign influence of the Stuarts and their religion, and they bore
the marks of their origin; many of them were indeed, as Dunning said in
seconding the motion for their repeal, a disgrace to humanity. Sir George
Savile, member for Yorkshire and a great Whig leader, moved the repeal
of some of them; he had no intention, he said, of touching the whole
penal code against Catholics, and was willing to substitute a test; but
he moved the repeal of some of the most obnoxious laws. These were the
law which punished the celebration of Catholic worship as felony in a
foreigner, as high treason in a native, and the laws by which the estates
of Popish heirs educated abroad passed to the next Protestant heir, by
which a Protestant heir could take possession of his father's or other
relative's estate during the lifetime of the real proprietor, and by
which Papists could acquire property only by descent. The first law was
so monstrous, and the others so evidently tended to foster the worst
forms of family division and public informing, that their repeal met with
little opposition. Dundas, Lord Advocate, promised a similar Bill for
Scotland. This was the beginning of opposition. The Scotch were indignant
at any sign of toleration, and organized a resistance which speedily
spread into England. The Protestants found a mouthpiece in Lord George
Gordon, a young man of slender intellect, and nearly mad on religious
topics; although his principles were so unsettled that he died a Jew, he
now threw himself with frenzied vehemence into the Protestant movement.
The King, with his usual power of sympathizing with the narrower views
of his people, took up the same side, and during the remainder of the
reign Catholic emancipation served as a test by which to try whether his
ministers would be subservient or not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">America rejects conciliatory offers.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Commissioners under the Conciliatory Bills had reached
America (May 1778). It was at once plain that they were too late. The
French alliance had been made known, and the Americans were as yet full
of enthusiasm for their allies. For a time the influence of Washington
had been shaken. His toilsome but inglorious work of reconstituting the
army of Valley Forge had been unfavourably contrasted with the brilliant
success of Saratoga; Gates, a man in every way his inferior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1088" id="Page_1088">[1088]</a></span>
had been set up as his rival, and placed at the head of a war committee,
which overruled Washington's advice and wishes. But the ridiculous
failure of a plan which, in the interests of the French, the committee
had suggested for attacking Canada had brought the Congress to reason,
and their trust in Washington had been restored. The division of
interests which had threatened the rising republic was thus healed, and
the Commissioners found a unanimous feeling against entertaining their
suggestions. Nor had the success of the English been such as to assist
their views. After a winter idly spent in Philadelphia, Sir William Howe
had been succeeded by Clinton, who had found it necessary to withdraw his
army to New York, which with Rhode Island were the sole possessions left
to England. The answer which the Commissioners received was therefore
very decided. No such questions as were raised could be considered till
the fleets and armies of England were withdrawn or the independence of
the colonies acknowledged. The Commissioners could only retire, leaving
behind them a manifesto threatening the utmost severities of war.</p>

<p>But, in spite of the confidence which the French alliance aroused in
the minds of the Americans, the immediate effect of the treaty was not
advantageous to them. A joint attack upon Rhode Island brought to
light the dislike and jealousy between the new allies which Chatham
had foreseen. The timely arrival of the English fleet compelled
the French admiral, d'Estaing, to leave the coast. The Americans
thought themselves deserted and gave up the siege. Their general,
Sullivan, published an indignant general order, and addressed to
<span class="sidenote">Effect of the alliance between America and
France.</span> d'Estaing a sharp remonstrance. In deep dudgeon, he ceased
for the rest of the year to assist the Americans, and acted wholly for
French interests, trying to excite a national sympathy in Canada, and
finally sailing away to the West Indies. For the time the French were
almost as unpopular with the colonists as the English. In other respects
the year's campaign was rather in favour of England. Georgia was occupied
by an expedition sent from New York, and the Island of St. Lucia was
captured from the French. But the object of the alliance was really
obtained, for the war was no longer confined to America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of North's ministry.</div>

<p>Resting on the support of the King, and backed in its American policy
by the general feeling of the nation, North's ministry, in spite of the
poor success which had attended our arms in America, had hitherto had
an appearance of strength. It was now, after a struggle of a few years,
to succumb to a succession of difficulties which brought to light its
inherent inefficiency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1089" id="Page_1089">[1089]</a></span>
The extension of the sphere of the war brought the first danger. A
powerful fleet had been sent into the Channel under Keppel, which at
the mere rumour of the approach of a superior fleet of the French
retired. When strongly reinforced, it brought the enemy to action off
Ushant, but after some hours' fighting the two fleets withdrew, without
the slightest advantage on either side; not one ship of either nation
had struck. To shield himself from the natural indignation felt at so
ridiculous a result, Keppel tried to throw the blame on Pallisser, his
second in command. As Keppel was in opposition, and Pallisser a Lord
of the Admiralty, the recriminations of the admirals were taken up by
their respective parties, and a vehement parliamentary war arose. At
length Keppel succeeded in obtaining a court martial, but the people as
well as the Parliament had joined in the quarrel; there were violent
demonstrations in his favour, and the case being in fact prejudged,
the trial ended in his triumphant acquittal. A far less complete and
unqualified sentence of approval awaited Pallisser when he in turn was
tried. Already it was evident that the hold of North's ministry was
shaken; it had now to face a direct attack in Parliament. Burgoyne and
Howe, both members of the House of Commons, were eager to throw all the
blame of the recent miscarriages upon the shoulders of the Government;
and an attack on the Admiralty was so successful, that Lord Sandwich was
only rescued by a narrow majority from censure by the declaration of Lord
North that he would resign were the censure carried. In his difficulties
Lord North made some overtures to the Whigs, but all negotiations were
rendered abortive by the restrictions placed on them by the King, who
would indeed allow new ministers to be introduced, but would hear of no
new measures. With the fatal facility which marred his character, North
yielded to the King's stronger will, and remained in office against his
own convictions, a mere official to carry out the policy of his master.
His difficulties were further increased when Spain followed in the
wake of France and also declared war; and the united fleets of the two
countries assembled, apparently with the intention of invading England.
In spite of a considerable exhibition of national spirit, it was all Sir
Charles Hardy, who had command of the Channel fleet, could do to cover
the coast of England and postpone a general engagement. Fortunately,
though the allies were vastly superior in numbers, their ships were ill
supplied and scarcely seaworthy, and they found it necessary to withdraw
to their respective countries, leaving the Channel free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1090" id="Page_1090">[1090]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not only from abroad that dangers were gathering
round England. The Irish, whom the people and Government of England
have always regarded as a colony, and treated in the same
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYNINE_DIFFICULTIES_IN_IRELAND" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYNINE_DIFFICULTIES_IN_IRELAND"></a>Difficulties in Ireland.</span> spirit of
jealous selfishness that had alienated the Americans, began to think
of following the example of these colonists. Their trade had always
been avowedly governed and confined to suit, not Irish, but English
interests. In addition to the usual restrictions, they had been suffering
from an embargo on their provision trade with America, and their other
industries were sinking in the general depression. When they saw Lord
North proposing conciliatory measures, and promising relaxation of trade
restrictions to America, they not unnaturally began to raise their claims
to similar indulgences. Their requests were so reasonable that some small
relief was given, but Lord North was afraid to carry out to the full a
policy of free trade in face of the vigorous opposition of the great
trading cities of England, where, with true commercial selfishness, any
chance of a new competitor was regarded with vehement dislike. Burke
was brave enough to speak heartily in favour of the Irish, in spite of
instructions from his Bristol constituents; his bravery cost him his
seat at the next election. With their fair claims thus trifled with, the
Irish again learnt a lesson from America. What could not be got by asking
might be yielded to an armed nation. On the pretext of an intended attack
by the French on Belfast, soldiers were demanded. But Ireland had been
denuded of troops for the American war; no troops could be sent. The
inhabitants had now their excuse for arming themselves. Quite without
disturbance, and with loyal protestations, volunteer corps sprang up all
over the country; by the end of the year, in spite of the influence of
Government, they numbered 50,000 men. In the presence of this army, with
the Dublin companies in arms before the doors, the Irish Parliament of
1779 met. The national cause had found an energetic and eloquent leader
in Henry Grattan. He moved an amendment to the address, demanding free
trade as the national right of Ireland. The amendment passed unopposed,
and was carried by the volunteers in triumph to the castle. Encouraged by
this success, backed by the armed force around them, and by the populace
of the city, the Parliament proceeded to the strong measure of granting
supplies for six months only. Such events at once attracted attention in
England, and votes of censure were moved by the Opposition on the Irish
policy of the Government. But Lord North had also learnt wisdom from
American affairs, and early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1091" id="Page_1091">[1091]</a></span>
in 1780 he passed Bills acknowledging the commercial equality of Ireland
and a free export of their chief commodities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTY_MOTIONS_FOR_ECONOMIC_REFORM" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTY_MOTIONS_FOR_ECONOMIC_REFORM"></a>Difficulties from the reform spirit in
England.</div>

<p>But even Ireland was by no means the last of Lord North's troubles.
The feeling against government by influence had been steadily on the
increase. With characteristic selfishness, the mass of the people had
sympathized with the war, which seemed to some rebellion against the
natural supremacy of Englishmen, and which others saw clearly was
a revolt against that commercial system which they regarded as the
chief safeguard of their own interests. But want of success, increased
taxation, and a diminution of trade, began to change the current of
opinion, and men observed with jealousy the impossibility of carrying
any measure against the influence of the Court. The King had completely
triumphed, and by means of his friends, his pensioners, contractors, and
sinecurists, could at all times command a large majority in Parliament.
The Whigs, finding that influence which they had so long wielded thus
transferred to other hands, began to see the enormity of such a system,
and the great leaders of the party, whose territorial power was very
great, put themselves at the head of a reform movement which soon became
important. In the autumn of 1779 motions for economical reform were
brought into the House of Lords. They were rejected; but in December
the general feeling, and the determination of the Whigs to create an
organization outside the House, were shown by a great meeting in York,
attended by a large majority of the freeholders of the county. This
influential meeting was followed by others of the same sort in many
counties, and the organizers of the party went so far as to establish
committees of correspondence on the model of the committees in America.
Twenty-three counties and many large towns, in spite of the constant
opposition of the Government, sent up petitions like the one agreed
to in Yorkshire, demanding a reduction in exorbitant emoluments and
the abolition of sinecures. Sir George Savile presented the Yorkshire
petition on the 8th of February, and three days afterwards Burke
introduced a great measure for economical reform of which he had already
given notice. Lord North found it so impossible to oppose him, that
the Bill passed almost unanimously into Committee. It there, however,
encountered a most vigorous resistance, and was finally destroyed
piecemeal. But the movement, once started, continued its course. Mr.
Crewe introduced a Bill to deprive revenue officers of their votes, and
Sir Philip Clerke another for the exclusion of contractors from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1092" id="Page_1092">[1092]</a></span>
House. Outside the House the pressure became heavier and heavier, till
at length, on the 6th of April, after a great meeting of the people of
Westminster, where Fox had harangued, and which was thought sufficiently
dangerous to demand the presence of troops, Dunning rose in the House,
and after blaming the ministry for their underhand obstruction to Burke's
Bill, produced the startling resolution, that "it is the opinion of this
Committee that the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing,
and ought to be diminished." This resolution, with a very slight
alteration, he was enabled to carry against Government by a majority of
eighteen. It was followed by two other resolutions in the same direction,
one declaring the right of the House to reform the Civil List, the other
that the abuses complained of should be immediately redressed. Both were
carried. But when the House again met, and he proceeded to more detailed
motions, Dunning found that the corrupt body he addressed, though willing
enough to affirm abstract resolutions, had no real liking for reform. His
majorities rapidly diminished, and finally no action was taken upon the
resolutions which he had carried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lord George Gordon riots. June 1780.</div>



<p>Scarcely had the ministry managed to escape from Dunning's resolutions
when a new danger came upon them. This time they did not stand alone.
All parties in the House had to join to repel a common enemy. It has
been mentioned that a measure of Sir George Savile's for the alleviation
of the penal laws against Roman Catholics had been carried, and that
the motion of introducing a similar measure for Scotland had caused
much displeasure in that country. The feeling spread, and Protestant
associations formed themselves throughout England, and fixed upon the
crackbrained Lord George Gordon for their chief and representative. The
agitation had been kept up during the last year, and now Lord George
wanted a great demonstration and petition to be got up. He declined to
present the petition unless accompanied by 20,000 followers, who were
to meet in St. George's Fields, adorned with blue cockades. Instead of
20,000, some 60,000 men were present, and proceeded to march across
London Bridge to the Parliament House. There, in Palace Yard, they held
their position unmolested, while they attacked and ill used any obnoxious
Peers, or broke into the lobby of the Lower House, and, with their
excitement kept alive by addresses which Lord George delivered from the
staircase above, demanded that their petition should be at once attended
to. Lord George was brought to some reason by a threat of personal
violence if he continued his foolish behaviour, and the military at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1093" id="Page_1093">[1093]</a></span>
length arriving, the immediate precincts of the Parliament House
were cleared. But though foiled in their wish to intimidate the House,
the mob were by no means satisfied, and the unaccountable and
timorous delay on the part of the executive, whether ministry or
magistrates, allowed the riot to reach such a height that it could be
with difficulty controlled. That night the chapels of the Sardinian
and Bavarian embassies were burnt, and after a day of comparative
quiet, the mob, finding itself unopposed, proceeded to renewed acts
of violence. For four days London was in its hands. The prisons
were broken open, Catholic chapels burnt and sacked, the shops of
Catholic tradesmen pillaged, and the houses of those who were
known to be favourable to the Catholic claims either destroyed, as
those of Lord Mansfield and Sir George Savile, or kept in a state of
siege. Johnson tells us how he saw the mob, quietly and undisturbed,
destroying the sessions house in the Old Bailey. Horace Walpole
found Lord Hertford's house barricaded and the lord himself and
his sons loading their muskets in expectation of an assault. On the
7th the tumult rose to its height. This was the fifth day of the
riots. The town was so intimidated that blue flags and strips of blue
were shown on most houses, and few came out without the blue
cockade. The rioters had long since passed from under the control
of their religious leaders, and were guided by leaders of their own.
On this day more than one attack was made on the Bank, headed by
a fellow mounted on a brewer's horse, with a harness of the chains
of Newgate jingling about him. More chapels were sacked, more
prisons opened. No less than thirty-six fires were blazing at once.
The most fearful scene was in Holborn, where Mr. Langdale's
distillery was broken open and set on fire. There, amid the flames
fed by constant supplies of spirit, the wretched rioters flew upon the
liquor, drinking the gin from pails, or lying grovelling and lapping
it from the kennel; many died of actual drunkenness, many more
perished helplessly in the flames. It was time that something should
be done, yet the ministry and magistrates alike shrank from doing
anything. There was a notion abroad that the military might not
act till an hour after the Riot Act had been read by a magistrate,
and courageous magistrates could not be found; nor was it forgotten
that on previous occasions soldiers had been harshly treated by juries
for over zeal. The emergency was one which well suited the dogged
and courageous character of the King. On the 7th he summoned
a Privy Council, and put to it the question whether the soldiers
might be employed without the machinery of the Riot Act. None<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1094" id="Page_1094">[1094]</a></span>
of the members of the Council would take the responsibility of
recommending such a course, and the Council had almost separated
without doing anything, when George called upon Wedderburn, who
was present as legal assessor, to state the view of the common law.
He unhesitatingly said that a soldier did not cease to be a citizen,
and might, and should, interfere to prevent acts of felony. This was
all the King required. There were 10,000 troops in London, and
he now felt he might act energetically. Orders were sent to Lord
Amherst, the commander-in-chief, to that effect, and that evening and
during the night such vigorous measures were taken that the mob
was at once crushed and the crisis over. The numbers killed and
wounded by the military were not less than 500, and probably very
many more, as many were carried off privately. Undoubtedly the
King's decision on this occasion saved London. Of the prisoners
some twenty-nine were executed. The Lord Mayor was tried and
<span class="sidenote">Trial of Lord George Gordon.</span> convicted of
criminal negligence. Lord George Gordon was arrested and foolishly tried
for high treason. Wedderburn had meanwhile become Lord Chief Justice, and
before him he was tried. The Judge's address was more like the pleading
of an advocate than the charge of a judge, and people felt it so; the
turn of feeling also had a little changed, and Lord George was acquitted.
He died, a Jew, in 1793 of gaol distemper caught in Newgate, where he
had been confined for libelling the Queen of France. When the House of
Commons again assembled the gigantic Protestant petition was considered.
It was met by five resolutions, the joint work of the political enemies
Burke and North, which declared the continual approval of the Commons of
the late Act of Toleration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gleams of success.</div>





<p>In the midst of these difficulties at home there had been some rays
of comfort from the success of both fleet and army abroad.
Early in the year Rodney had been placed in command of
a fleet which was to act in the West Indies. On his way out he had
<span class="sidenote">Rodney's victory.</span> instructions to relieve
Gibraltar, which had been closely invested since the beginning of the
war with Spain. While carrying out these orders he met the Spanish fleet
off Cape St. Vincent and gained over it a complete victory. Four line of
battle-ships were taken, four destroyed, only four made their escape.
Gibraltar was then relieved, and Minorca also, so that Rodney could
write home that the English were masters of the Mediterranean. He thence
proceeded on his way to the West Indies, where De Guichen, with the
French and Spanish fleets, could not be brought to an engagement, and
where for the time nothing was done. Though Rodney's successes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1095" id="Page_1095">[1095]</a></span>
those of Admiral Digby in the Bay of Biscay were somewhat neutralized by
the entire destruction of our West and East India fleets, ably planned
and carried out by the Spaniards off the Azores, they raised the spirits
of the Government, coupled as they were with cheering news from the
army. Just as the Gordon riots were suppressed, information arrived that
Charleston, the capital of South Carolina, had
<span class="sidenote">Capture of Charleston.</span> fallen into our
hands. On several occasions during the war the eyes of the commanders had
been turned southward. The feeling of loyalty was less shaken there than
in the more northern provinces, and it seemed desirable that the efforts
of England should not be confined to one little spot along the whole of
the enormous seaboard of America. Savannah in Georgia had already been
taken, and in pursuance of a general plan for acting on a more extended
basis, Clinton moved with the bulk of his army from New York and besieged
Charleston. The siege was carried on with vigour and skill, and General
Lincoln found himself obliged to surrender. Clinton set actively to work
to reduce the Carolinas. Virginia, one of the centres of disaffection,
would thus be between two fires, and something more tangible might be
effected than had yet been <span class="sidenote">The interest of the
war passes to the South.</span> done by the army at New York. In fact,
the interest of the war was now transferred to the South, for though
Washington and the main American army still lay about New York, its
effect there was only to neutralize the English army opposed to it, while
the active operations which led to the end of the war were carried on at
Carolina and Virginia.</p>

<p>Before describing the final struggle, it will be well to see the
difficulties under which the English laboured. The war had become
a world-wide one. Not only had the two maritime powers France
and Spain engaged in it, but it was plain that our old rivals the
<span class="sidenote">England alone against all Europe.</span>
Dutch were soon going to do so also. Before the end of the year an
unusually strong instance of our determination to insist on the right of
searching neutral ships, when a convoy was searched and captured under
the guns of the convoying <span class="sidenote">War with the Dutch.</span>
ships of war, had raised the anger of the Dutch to a high pitch. The
capture of a vessel containing Mr. Laurens, late President of the
American Congress, and proofs that he was engaged in making an alliance
with the States of Holland, rendered it impossible to avoid a declaration
of war, and Holland was added to our armed opponents. Nor was this all.
The same odious rigour of search nearly brought all the nations of the
North upon us. The Empress of Russia had suffered from it at the hands
of the Spaniards. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1096" id="Page_1096">[1096]</a></span>
therefore, acting probably at the instigation of the King of Prussia,
<span class="sidenote">Armed neutrality of the North.</span> constituted
herself the champion of neutral rights, and succeeded in uniting the
nations of the North in an armed neutrality in support of the doctrine
that neutral ships made neutral cargoes, and that nothing was contraband
of war except what had been definitely made so by treaty. In other
words, she claimed for neutrals the right of carrying the property of
belligerents unmolested, a right which virtually told against the English
only, whose main hope lay in keeping dominion of the sea and stopping
the trade and supplies of its enemies. The Armed Neutrality also upheld
the now generally received principle that a blockade to be respected
must be efficient, that is, that there must be sufficient force before
a blockaded port to prevent the entrance of trading vessels. The whole
maritime power of Europe was thus arrayed against England, and yet it was
only by keeping the upper hand at sea that she could hope to carry out
successfully her attempts on land. It was impossible to pour large armies
into America and to subdue a continent without some easily accessible
base of operations. This base the sea afforded. It will be seen in the
sequel that the loss of naval supremacy was the immediate cause of the
disaster of Yorktown.</p>

<p>But as yet the arms of England continued to be successful. Clinton,
leaving Cornwallis to command in the South, had hastened back
from Carolina to New York, that he might be ready to oppose the
French fleet, whose arrival had been threatened. In June the expected
armament arrived, consisting of seven line of battle-ships
and 6000 men under the Count de Rochambeau. The rapidity with
which Rhode Island was at once occupied and placed in a state of
defence thwarted the efforts of the English to regain it, but the
British fleet was so much stronger than that of the enemy that a
blockade was maintained around the seaboard of the province, which
paralyzed all action on the part of the French for the rest of the year.
This forced inactivity of Rochambeau gave rise to one of the best
known episodes of the war. Washington left his headquarters to
<span class="sidenote">Arnold's treachery.</span> meet the French general
and concert measures for action if possible. His absence was used for
the purpose of carrying out a piece of treachery which had long been
hatching. General Arnold was in command at West Point on the Hudson,
a position of great importance, as it prevented the occupation of the
valley which affords direct communication between New York and Canada.
Married to a royalist wife, with a feeling that his undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1097" id="Page_1097">[1097]</a></span>
genius was not sufficiently valued, and smarting under a public reprimand
for some dishonest practices into which he had been led by his poverty
and love of ostentation, Arnold had for some time been in secret
correspondence with Clinton, making arrangements for changing sides, and
handing over to the English the important post of which he had charge.
The correspondence had been carried on through Major André, a young
and very promising officer, now Adjutant-General of Clinton's army.
Washington's departure seemed to offer an opportunity for carrying out
the plan. To complete the negotiation a personal interview was required,
and Major André, with instructions from Clinton not to enter the lines
of the enemy and to wear uniform, repaired to the neighbourhood of West
Point. When day dawned the interview was not over, and André was induced
to continue it in a house within the American lines. On leaving he was
also imprudent enough to dress as a civilian. He had already passed the
lines on his homeward journey, when he was accidentally met and stopped
by some militiamen; he avowed himself an English officer, but presented a
pass from Arnold; the pass was disregarded, he was searched, and papers
found in his boot. Under these circumstances there were about him all the
outward marks of a spy, and as such he was <span class="sidenote">Trial
and death of Major André.</span> treated. Much to the anger of the
English, Washington, refusing to hear any representations in his favour,
brought him to trial before a court of American officers, by whom he was
condemned. He even rejected the last prayer of the enthusiastic soldier,
that he might be saved from a felon's death, and had him hanged, with
all the usual attendant circumstances of disgrace&mdash;a piece of stern
but perhaps necessary justice, and, in spite of the outcry raised at
the time, apparently in strict accordance with the laws of war. Timely
information of André's capture enabled Arnold to escape from his house,
where Washington was momentarily expected, and to obtain shelter on
board the English man-of-war which had conveyed André to the ill-fated
meeting. Washington was surprised on reaching Arnold's house to find no
host, but it was not till he had paid a visit to West Point, and found
the commander absent there also, that he discovered the real state of the
case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Campaign in Carolina.</div>

<p>While things were thus at a standstill round New York, the war had
been actively prosecuted in Carolina. Alarmed by the fall of Charleston,
the Americans had sent General Gates to take the command there; they
regarded him as their ablest general, and he figured in some degree as a
rival to Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1098" id="Page_1098">[1098]</a></span>
He found the English in possession of a line of country extending from
Pedee river to Fort 96. The main body of the English, under the command
of Lord Rawdon, lay in the neighbourhood of Camden, towards the centre
of this line. Against this position Gates advanced; his march was a
very difficult one; he had to make his way through a rough uncultivated
country, where provisions were not to be obtained; for several days his
troops had to subsist on the peaches which are there almost indigenous.
He was able, in spite of these difficulties, to bring into the field a
force numerically double that of the English, who were no more than 2000
strong. His troops, however, were unable to withstand the attack of a
well-disciplined force. On the left and centre they at once threw down
their arms and took to flight. The troops from Maryland and Delaware
upon the right showed, it is true, more firmness, but the victory of the
English was complete, and Lord Cornwallis, who had hurried up to assume
the command, improved it to the utmost. Colonel Tarleton, an officer of
indefatigable energy, pushed rapidly forward, and succeeded in surprising
Colonel Sumter, a partisan officer, on the Catawba, and the whole army
moved steadily forward to Charlotte, with the intention of invading North
Carolina. A slight check sustained by a body of loyal militia, however,
alarmed Cornwallis, and, together with the smallness of the number of
troops at his command, induced him to postpone his forward movement till
the following year. In the interval he and Lord Rawdon, his second in
command, were guilty of acts of most impolitic severity. Such prisoners
as could be proved to be deserters from the royal army, or to have once
accepted the royal Government and to have subsequently joined Gates, were
hanged. Some of the disaffected residents of Charleston were deported to
Saint Augustin, while the property of others was sequestrated. Rawdon
in fact went even further, and ventured to set a price on the head of
every rebel. Such acts went far to alienate the people, and by weakening
the security of the communications increased the difficulties of the
following year, and tended to neutralize the effects of a very promising
campaign.</p>

<p>The same success which had attended the English arms in Carolina
followed the efforts of the fleet in the early part of the next year;
Rodney captured from the Dutch, who had joined the coalition
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYONE_ST_EUSTATIA_CAPTURED" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYONE_ST_EUSTATIA_CAPTURED"></a>St. Eustatia captured. 1781.</span> against
England, the enormously wealthy island of St. Eustatia. Much of the
property collected there belonged however to English owners, and a vast
clamour arose when the admiral declared it all prize of war. He asserted, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1099" id="Page_1099">[1099]</a></span>
subsequently became plain, that the island was used as an entrepôt for
the collection of goods which were afterwards to be supplied to the
enemy. Other charges brought against him, accusing him of hasty and
over rigorous action, afterwards proved to be equally ill founded,
for fortunately both military and naval commanders were members of
Parliament, and had full opportunity of vindicating themselves before the
House, and of stripping the charges against them of the exaggerations
which surrounded them. Thus General Vaughan was charged with forcible
removal of all Jews from the island, but was able to produce a written
document from the Jews themselves thanking him for his considerate
treatment of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delusive character of these early successes.</div>

<p>These successes soon proved to be delusive. The coalition against
England was becoming too powerful to be withstood. Already a great drawn
battle with the Dutch had been fought off the Doggerbank, and Sir Hyde
Parker had been compelled to withdraw his shattered fleet into English
quarters; and it soon became evident that we had for the present lost
our supremacy of the sea, or at least were unable to keep a commanding
superiority in all parts of the world at once, for to such dimensions
had the war grown. Thus the French made an attack upon Jersey, which
was only saved, when it had already fallen into their hands, by the
intrepidity of Major Pierson, a young soldier of twenty-five, who himself
lost his life by almost the last shot fired; another and more successful
expedition under the Duke of Crillon assaulted Minorca; while a great
armament setting out from France parted midway across the Atlantic, thus
becoming two fleets, one of which, under Bailli de Suffren, was able to
give us full employment in the Indian waters, while the other, under De
Grasse, raised the naval power in the West Indies above our own. Rodney
found himself unable to save the Island of Tobago, and, broken by the
climate, was compelled to return to England. Nor was his successor Sir
Samuel Hood more fortunate; a detached squadron was found sufficient to
counterbalance the English fleet in the West Indies, while De Grasse
sailed with the bulk of his fleet to the American coast, where his
arrival at once turned the balance against us, and deprived us of that
command of the sea which was absolutely necessary for our success. The
fatal effects of this loss were soon to be apparent.</p>



<p>The first warlike event of the year was an expedition under
General Arnold (who had obtained a command from his new
masters) directed against Virginia, in the hope that such a diversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1100" id="Page_1100">[1100]</a></span>
might assist Cornwallis in what was intended to be the main effort
of the year. It produced however no great effects beyond the
destruction of a considerable amount of property, and when Cornwallis
set himself in motion, he found himself faced by a more
formidable opponent than General Gates. At the instigation of
Washington, Nathaniel Greene, a self-made general, who had risen
from a blacksmith's forge, had been given command in the South.
He proved himself a man of great vigour and tenacity, and though
invariably beaten when opposed to any large body of English troops,
he contrived to recover so quickly, that the barren name of victory
was usually all that was left to the English. The campaign opened
by the defeat of Colonel Tarleton, who had rashly attacked the
Americans under Morgan at Cow-pens; nor could Cornwallis succeed
in getting between the victorious general and Greene's army; their
united forces were compelled however to fall back before Cornwallis'
advance till they had evacuated the whole of North Carolina.
Political necessities checked the English advance, and Cornwallis
attempted, without much success, to consolidate the royal influence in
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Guildford Courthouse. March 15.</span>
the province; but, by the middle of March, Greene found himself again
in a position to re-enter Carolina and to give battle to Cornwallis in
the neighbourhood of Guildford. He occupied a position at Guildford
Courthouse; as usual the English were victorious, as usual they reaped
nothing from their victory, for Cornwallis, finding his troops much
diminished in numbers and not meeting with the assistance he expected
from the inhabitants, was compelled to fall back upon Wilmington.
Greene did not long pursue him, for by thus withdrawing to the coast
he had laid open the road into South Carolina, where Rawdon had been
left with a small detachment. Greene saw his opportunity, and pushing
boldly southward, again approached the English post at Camden. Afraid
to attack Rawdon without reinforcements, he occupied a strong position
upon Hobkirk's Hill, about two miles from Camden. There Rawdon thought it
prudent to attack him, and he was driven from his position. The ludicrous
insufficiency of the <span class="sidenote">Hobkirk's Hill. April 25, 1781.</span>
English troops (there were but 900 engaged in the battle) again prevented
them from using their victory, and Greene was enabled, without risking
another engagement, to compel Rawdon to withdraw his troops to the
immediate defence of Charleston.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two courses had been open to Cornwallis at Wilmington;
he might either hurry in pursuit of Greene and assist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1101" id="Page_1101">[1101]</a></span>
hard pressed army of Rawdon, or push northward and effect a junction
with the Virginian expedition, which has already been mentioned,
under Arnold and Phillips. To pursue the first course was to give
up all his previous successes, to relinquish all hope of striking a
decisive blow; for independent action his own army, numbering only
1500, was too small: he decided therefore to march northward, and
in May formed a junction with the expedition, by which the number
of his troops was raised to 7000. He left Wilmington on the day on
which the battle of Hobkirk's Hill was fought. Till the heat of
summer compelled a cessation of active fighting, Cornwallis was
always superior to his enemy; but as the autumn advanced, the
Americans, who had been constantly reinforced, were again a match
<span class="sidenote">Position of the English armies.</span>
for him. The three English armies were then acting&mdash;the
main body, 10,000 strong, under Clinton at New
York&mdash;Cornwallis' army, about 7000 strong, on the coast of Virginia&mdash;Rawdon's
handful of men, now under the command of Colonel Stewart, a little in
advance of Charleston. Before the close of the year the whole of South
Carolina and Georgia were lost, with the exception of Charleston and
Savannah; for Greene, coming down from his summer position on
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Eutaw. Sept. 8.</span>
the Santee Hills, had succeeded, after a very severe struggle at the
Eutaw Springs, in obliging Colonel Stewart to retire to Charleston Neck,
leaving the whole open country to be overrun by the Americans.</p>

<p>The position of Cornwallis was also becoming critical. Cut off from
support on the south, his only hope was to fight his way northwards
to join Clinton, or to receive large reinforcements from this general
by sea; but it was not likely that Washington would allow his army
to be neutralized by the English troops in New York. It was almost
certain that he would turn his attention southward, join General
<span class="sidenote">Cornwallis in Virginia.</span> Wayne in Virginia,
and render a northward movement of the English impossible. The only
real hope was from the sea, but the sea was no longer a secure basis of
operations. The English fleet, now under the command of Admiral Graves,
who had succeeded Arbuthnot, tried its strength against De Grasse in
September. The action was indecisive, but it became evident that, when
all the fleets were joined, the French could muster thirty-six sail of
the line in the Bay of Chesapeake, while the English force was no more
than twenty-five. But as yet the English did not acknowledge the naval
superiority of their enemies, and Cornwallis, acting as he believed,
though apparently erroneously, on instructions from Clinton, took
possession of Yorktown, a village on the high southern bank of York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1102" id="Page_1102">[1102]</a></span>
river, and there awaited assistance. The defensive position thus
taken up by the English army and the want of energy shown is
explained by the news which had reached Clinton, that the French
were thinking of withdrawing if the war should last beyond the
current year. He believed that, could he contrive to weather the
difficulties which surrounded him, the opposition of the Americans,
unable to stand alone, would on the loss of their allies disappear
without further effort on his part. His hope was not unfounded; it
was in truth a critical moment for the Americans. At a meeting
between the American generals and De Grasse, the Admiral had
declared that he had orders not to remain longer than November;
the nation was on the verge of bankruptcy; the New England States,
with the selfishness which had marked them throughout, were ready
<span class="sidenote">American armies close round Yorktown.</span>
to give in. It was thus absolutely necessary for Washington to act
quickly and to win some striking success. What Clinton therefore ought to
have foreseen happened; Washington turned his attention towards Virginia,
and undeterred by an assault on the New England States which Clinton
attempted as a diversion, the mass of the American army began steadily to
gather round Cornwallis. The position which he occupied was not a happy
one, it was in fact untenable without command of the sea, which, as has
been mentioned, had already been lost. He occupied the southern bank of
the York river, there about a mile wide, and on the northern side the
little village of Gloucester. The fortifications were of no great value,
and the advanced posts were at once withdrawn upon the receipt of a
despatch from Clinton, stating that there was every hope that the fleet,
with 5000 men, would attempt to relieve the army, and would leave New
York for that purpose in about ten days' time. This was a fatal error, as
it gave the enemy positions commanding the works. The besiegers numbered
18,000, their large and powerful artillery being in part supplied by the
French ships. The first parallel was completed on the 9th of October;
the fire from it was overwhelming: on the 11th the second parallel was
opened, nor could the bravery of the besieged prevent the capture of
two advanced redoubts on the 14th, which were at once included in it.
It now became evident to the besieged that the expected reinforcements
had failed them, and after a brilliant sally, during which many of the
enemy's guns were spiked, Cornwallis, finding all his guns silenced and
his ammunition drawing to a close, felt that he had to choose between
surrender and an effort to withdraw his troops from their
untenable position. He determined to attempt the latter plan; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1103" id="Page_1103">[1103]</a></span>
scheme was a desperate one; his troops were to be transported in open
boats to Gloucester, they were there to break through the enemy's
lines, which were not strong in that direction, to seize the horses of
the besiegers and of the neighbouring country people, and make their
way to New York. The boats with their loads had already crossed once
when a storm arose which rendered the further prosecution of the plan
impossible, and when morning dawned Cornwallis had no alternative but
to make terms. He agreed to surrender all his troops as prisoners of
war, and on the 19th of October, 4000 British soldiers who remained fit
for work marched out with the honours of war between the long lines
of the French and American army and laid down their arms. It is worth
mentioning, as a strange little piece of professional arrogance,
<span class="sidenote">Cornwallis compelled to surrender. Oct. 18, 1781.</span>
that when marching between the lines of French on the one side and
Americans on the other, the English officers saluted punctiliously all
the French officers as belonging to a regular army, but refused any
acknowledgment to the Americans. This was virtually the close of the war.
The infant Hercules had strangled its second serpent, as was afterwards
portrayed on Franklin's medal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New session of Parliament. Nov. 27.</div>

<p>The close of the war under such circumstances of failure could not
but bring with it the fall of the ministry. The news
arrived at a striking time, but two days before the
opening of the session. With such a weapon in their
hand, and with the stored-up rancour of ten years of opposition, the
leaders of the Whigs pressed motion after motion against the Government.
<span class="sidenote">Tottering condition of the Government.</span>
Fox and Burke vied with each other in their bitter assaults, and the
young Pitt, who had come into Parliament as member for Appleby, on the
nomination of Sir James Lowther, rapidly assumed a high position on the
same side. The Budget was in itself a proof that Lord North was yielding;
the estimates were so small, that he had to explain that he intended to
give up all notion of a war on a "continental plan by sending armies to
march through the provinces from South to North;" he would henceforth
content himself with holding some important harbours on the American
coast. Outside Parliament, in the metropolitan counties, vigorous
opposition meetings were held, and the public anger was raised to its
climax by a succession of misfortunes which befell our arms. Admiral
Kempenfeldt found himself completely outnumbered in the West Indies, and
the whole of the Leeward Islands, except Barbadoes and Antigua, were lost.
Minorca, which was regarded as of even more importance than Gibraltar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1104" id="Page_1104">[1104]</a></span>
and the key to the Mediterranean, surrendered after a gallant defence.
The Bailli de Suffren thwarted an expedition against the Cape of
Good Hope, at the same time at home the Irish difficulties, which will
be treated of more at length afterwards, were becoming most threatening.
Under these circumstances, a motion by General Conway, that
<span class="sidenote">Defeat of the ministry on Conway's motion.</span>
the war on the continent of America should be discontinued was lost by
one vote only, and a repetition of the same motion a week later was
carried by a majority of 234 against 215. Lord George Germaine, who was
pledged to the continuance of the war, withdrew from the Government, and
finally a direct vote of no confidence on the 15th of March was only
lost by a scanty majority of nine. North saw that further struggle was
hopeless, and on the 20th compelled the King to allow him to declare the
administration at an end. He went out of office with his usual tact and
good humour. A great attack had been arranged for that evening, which
was to be led by Lord Surrey; he and North rose at the same moment, and
the cries from the rival parties could not be quelled till Fox rose and
proposed a formal motion that Lord <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTWO_NORTHS_RESIGNATION" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTWO_NORTHS_RESIGNATION"></a>Lord North's
resignation.</span> Surrey be first heard. With admirable presence
of mind, North rose and said that he would speak to that motion, and
prove its inutility by declaring his government at an end. There is a
well-known anecdote of his persistent good humour; expecting a long
debate, the Opposition members had sent away their carriages, and as
they stood awaiting them shivering in the drizzling rain, Lord North
passed through them to get into his. "Gentlemen," he said, "you see the
advantage of being in the secret," and drove off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shelburne refuses the Premiership.</div>



<p>North's resignation was the complete defeat for the time of
the King's plans; but George III. was a man of the
most obstinate and determined character, and he by no
means intended as yet to give up the fight. The Opposition
which had formed the alliance to drive North from office consisted
of two sections. First, the old or Revolution Whigs, as they
liked to call themselves, who, true to their aristocratic principle, had
chosen for their leader the wealthiest but by no means the ablest
man among them, Lord Rockingham, an agriculturist, a sporting
man, of respectable talents and much honesty, though without any
of the gifts of oratory which are necessary for the management of a
public body; and secondly, those Whigs who had owned the leadership
of Chatham, and who now followed the Earl of Shelburne; a
party less tied by aristocratic connections, and representing, as far as
could then be represented, the real liberal interests of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1105" id="Page_1105">[1105]</a></span>
To avoid the necessity of putting himself into the hands of his
particular enemies, the Whig families, it was to this section that the
King at once applied. But, as Chatham had always found, it was of itself
far too weak a party in Parliament to form a satisfactory ministry.
Moreover, the eagerness with which Burke and Dunning had of late years
demanded financial reform, and the share they had taken in driving North
from office, made it impossible for their claims to be ignored. Shelburne
therefore refused the King's request. The King's discomfiture seemed
quite complete when Rockingham <span class="sidenote">New Whig Government.</span>
accepted office. The ministry consisted of equal numbers of the two
sections of the Liberals. Rockingham, Keppel, Lord John Cavendish, the
Duke of Richmond, and Mr. Fox, of the one party; Lord Shelburne, Camden,
General Conway, Lord Ashburton (Dunning), and the Duke of Grafton of the
other. Strangely enough, the balance between them was held by the Tory
Lord Thurlow, the King's personal friend, who remained in the position
of Lord Chancellor. Pitt haughtily refused to accept any subordinate
office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three questions which met it.</div>

<p>Three great questions at once presented themselves to the new
administration,&mdash;to pacify the clamours of Ireland, to complete the
economical reforms to which they were pledged, and by means of which
they hoped to regain some of the power of which the successful policy of
the King had robbed them, and to bring to conclusion as honourably as
possible the American War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The agitation in Ireland.</div>

<p>In Ireland the agitation had been constantly on the increase since the
conciliatory measures of Lord North in 1780. Free trade had been granted,
but this step towards independence had opened the way to still further
demands; if they had followed the Americans thus far, why not follow them
a step further and demand legislative independence also? The legislative
superiority of England rested mainly upon two Statutes, Poynings' Law, or
the Statute of Drogheda of the reign of Henry VII., by which all Bills
brought forward in the Irish Parliament, except such as regarded money,
were subject to revision or suppression by the English Privy Council,
and the Statute 6 George I., which asserted the right of the English
Parliament to legislate for Ireland. No sooner had Grattan succeeded in
his first agitation, than he proceeded, in spite even of the wishes of
his friends Lord Charlemont and Burke, to set to work the same machinery
for the purpose of obtaining the reversal of these statutes. As early as
April 1780 he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1106" id="Page_1106">[1106]</a></span>
produced, though unsuccessfully, a motion in the Irish Parliament
declaratory of Irish independence. Since that time his position had
become stronger, disputes in Parliament had excited the national feeling,
the volunteers had completed their organization, and appointed Lord
Charlemont their commander-in-chief. A great meeting of deputies from
the volunteers had been held at Dungannon, which had accepted to the
full Grattan's propositions. With this great armed power behind him, and
reinforced by the influence of the Roman Catholics, whose interests he
had lately espoused, Grattan was enabled on the 16th of April to bring
forward a final and successful address declaring the perfect legislative
independence of Ireland. It was carried unanimously through both Houses.
In face of this pressure, though not blind to the almost inevitable
evils of a dual Government, Fox and Shelburne yielded the point, and the
Statute of George I. was repealed in express terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Economical reforms.</div>

<p>The ministry had entered upon office supported by a vast agitation
throughout the country, by county meetings, societies and
corresponding associations, and these allies outside the
walls of Parliament were eager for very sweeping measures of reform
in all directions, especially financial reform, limitation of the influence
of the Crown, the purity of the House, and reform of the
representation. All these measures had a political as well as an
economical side. They all formed portions of the avowed politics of
the Whigs for breaking the power of the Crown. Both revenue
officers and contractors assisted to uphold Government influence; the
votes of the revenue officers were said to command no less than
seventy boroughs, and contracts, given not because advantageous to
the public, but for political purposes, were but so many indirect
bribes. But the voice of the statesman is apt to be singularly tempered
by his accession to office, and the Government Bills which Burke
introduced in June proved but a weak reflection of his former
measure. Certain obvious abuses were removed, secret service money
was diminished, and a smaller share of it allowed to the Treasury; the
Pension List was cut down, and £300 fixed as the outside limit for a
single pension; the whole Board of Trade, which had proved useless,
was swept away; but the expenses of the Principality of Wales and
the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, together with many useless
offices of the Household, and public offices, were untouched, and the
whole saving effected was only about £72,000 a year. Burke in
thus limiting his propositions was doubtless acting under pressure
from his colleagues. His own sincerity was proved by the limitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1107" id="Page_1107">[1107]</a></span>
which he set to the inordinate emolument which as Paymaster he derived
from his own office. But the honesty of the ministry as a whole
was somewhat compromised when they forestalled the action of their
own Bill, and hurriedly granted large pensions, varying from £2600
to £3200, to Lord Grantham, to the Chancellor, and to Colonel Barré.
Still further proof that a limitation of the royal power and not real
reform was the object in view, was given by the reception accorded to
a measure for parliamentary reform introduced by William Pitt.
Chatham had always seen and asserted that some measure of parliamentary
reform was necessary if influence was to give way to any true
national representation. But though constantly inveighing against
Government influence when in the hands of their opponents, the
Whig oligarchs, to whom parliamentary influence was as necessary
as it was to the King himself, had no idea of lessening their own
power, and Pitt's measure for transferring it to the counties, at that
time the chief homes of independence, though ably supported, was
defeated by a majority of twenty, swelled by the open opposition of
some of the ministry and the lukewarmness of others. Fox and
the Duke of Richmond however supported him. Divisions in the
Cabinet upon so important a question, scandals such as the Barré
pension and the unsatisfactory carrying out of promises of economical
reform, tended to lessen the popularity of the ministry. But it was
the management of the great question of all, the completion, namely,
of an honourable peace, which displayed chiefly the weakness of the
administration.</p>

<p>As far as America itself was concerned the fall of Yorktown had
virtually put an end to hostilities, and the declared policy of England
<span class="sidenote">Conclusion of the American War.</span>
reached no further than the retention of certain posts and
harbours. It may be a question whether this was wise,
for it is certain that the condition of the Americans was
very deplorable. Bankrupt and impoverished, the Congress was in
no condition to support the army in a state of efficiency, and from its
factions and intrigues had so lost public confidence, that Washington
was earnestly intreated to make himself dictator, and take the
management of the country into his own hands. But it was impossible
for the Whigs, after the language they had used in Parliament, where
they had not scrupled to rejoice at American successes, and to speak
of the American armies as <i>our</i> armies, to think of anything but
peace at once and on any terms. But though the war with America
thus died out, that with the allied powers of Europe was by no means
ended. Spain and France had joined the Americans with the cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1108" id="Page_1108">[1108]</a></span>
independence, absurd enough from such monarchies, but with the real
object of destroying the power of England, and reversing the humiliating
terms forced upon them by the Treaty of 1763. The Dutch
had joined the coalition for commercial objects of its own; they were
desirous of destroying the English Navigation Act and of restoring the
freedom of the sea. The moment seemed to have arrived when all
these wishes could be gratified, and negotiations for a general peace were
therefore of a twofold character and by no means easy to complete,
as America was pledged not to conclude a treaty without her allies.
A further complication arose from the peculiar arrangements of the
English ministry, by which American affairs fell to the lot of
Shelburne as Home Secretary, while Fox, his rival in the ministry, in
his capacity of Foreign Minister had the duty of negotiating with the
European powers. As Dr. Franklin, the most important American
diplomatist, was at this time in Paris, that city became the centre of
negotiations, and thither both ministers sent agents. Mr. Oswald, on
the part of Lord Shelburne, began to open the business with Franklin,
while Mr. Thomas Granville was accredited as plenipotentiary from
Fox to arrange matters with M. Vergennes, the French minister.
With singular ingratitude, the Americans, though bound not to
<i>conclude</i> a treaty without their allies, thought it right to complete all
the arrangements except the actual conclusion secretly and separately
with the English, although they had not thought it beneath them to
let their allies undertake all the more arduous parts of the war. Although
there was some difference of opinion as to the exact manner of
granting the independence of America, all parties in England were
agreed that it should be granted, and as this was the sole point at
issue between the countries, there was little to be done but the
arrangement of boundaries and some minor details.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exorbitant demands of France.</div>

<p>Very different was the case with the French; when the basis of the
Treaty of 1763 was proposed it was absolutely refused.
It was plainly asserted that the very object of the war
had been to annihilate that treaty, and hints were thrown
out that England would be expected to surrender even a large part
of her East Indian dominions. "Your arms are too long," said M. de
Vergennes, "why not be satisfied with Bengal?" Before the year
was over events happened which caused the French to lower their
tone. The fall of Yorktown and the subsequent failure of the arms
of England had made them believe that her power was gone, and they
confidently looked forward to the success of two great enterprises
then on foot to complete her discomfiture. De Grasse, with a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1109" id="Page_1109">[1109]</a></span>
fleet, was to join the Spanish fleet in the West Indies, take troops on
board, and seize Jamaica. The fall of Minorca had set De Crillon
free to complete the fall of Gibraltar, with a vast armament which
he had been engaged in organizing. To Rodney was intrusted the duty
of protecting Jamaica; he determined to prevent the junction of the
enemy's fleets. A line of frigates within signal distance extended
from St. Lucia to the French position at Martinique, and the enemy
had not been two hours at sea before he was in pursuit. After some
ineffectual efforts he succeeded in getting to the windward of the
enemy, and on the 10th of April brought the French fleet to action.
The number of the fleets was exactly equal. The superiority in
number of men and weight of metal was in favour of the French.
The battle is famous for the introduction into naval tactics of the
man&oelig;uvre called breaking the line. Before this time it was usual to
meet the enemy in line, to close up ship to ship, and win the battle
chiefly by hard fighting. The new man&oelig;uvre consisted in advancing
in column against the enemy's line, passing through it, thus breaking
it in half, and enveloping one of the halves with the whole fleet.
On the present occasion its use resulted in a complete victory. The
English took or destroyed eight ships; the loss of the French was
very great, being much increased by the crowded state of their vessels,
which had on board the soldiers intended for the Jamaica expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Gibraltar. Sept. 13.</div>

<p>In spite of this great success, the ministry continued its efforts
at peace, but so long as there was any hope of securing better terms by
the capture of Gibraltar the French would not come to the point. Nor
did the change of ministry caused by the death of Rockingham change the
aspect of affairs. Gibraltar had now been three years besieged. British
fleets had twice forced the blockade and relieved the garrison. General
Elliot's defence was vigorous, and inspired his troops with confidence.
In the last November a great sally had destroyed the greater part of the
enemy's works, but now a final effort of the united house of Bourbon
was to be made. De Crillon, fresh from his success at Minorca, took the
command, and neglecting the attack from the land side, set his hopes on
a terrific bombardment to be conducted from the sea. He constructed ten
huge floating batteries, with walls of wood and iron seven feet thick,
shot proof and bomb proof; a fleet of more than forty first-rates was in
the harbour, and a fire from 400 pieces of artillery, in answer to which
the English could produce but 100, was to annihilate the fortress. Elliot
was not disheartened; trusting to the natural strength of the
place in other directions, he concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1110" id="Page_1110">[1110]</a></span>
the whole of his fire upon the terrible batteries. For a long while they
seemed absolutely impenetrable, but at length the constant stream of
red hot shot took effect, and at mid-day their fire slackened. Before
midnight the largest of them burst into flames, and eight out of the
ten were on fire during the night. The siege was over, and the fleet,
which still waited in the hope of meeting Lord Howe on his arrival
with a relieving squadron, was driven from the harbour by the weather
before he came, so that he was able to enter and relieve the garrison
unmolested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changed tone of French demands.</div>

<p>This great success, following so close upon the West Indian victory,
made it plain to the allies that England was by no means so prostrate as
they had imagined, and there was no longer much difficulty in settling
the preliminaries of a peace. France accepted readily the offers which
had been rejected in the earlier part of the year. The English ceded
the little islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon in the St. Lawrence, and
the African establishments of Senegal and Goree. In the West Indies
everything was restored to the same condition as before the war, with
the exception of Tobago, which was given to France. In the East Indies
the French were permitted to retain their commercial establishments, but
without military occupation. The treaty for the destruction of Dunkirk
was formally given up. With these slight <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_TERMS_OF_THE_PEACE" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_TERMS_OF_THE_PEACE"></a>Terms of
peace. Jan 20, 1783.</span> concessions France had to be satisfied. Spain
kept Minorca; and the Floridas were given up to her&mdash;better terms
than she had a right to expect. England received in exchange the Bahamas,
which she had already reconquered, and the right of cutting logwood in
Honduras. Holland, with whom the English Government had in vain attempted
a separate treaty, gained nothing by her rejection of those overtures,
but was obliged to agree to a mutual restoration of conquests, with
the exception of the seaport town of Negapatam, which remained to the
English. A provisional treaty had already been made with America, by
which the independence of the States was formally declared, boundaries
settled, and commercial relations re-established. The only difficulty was
the claim for compensation for loss of property raised by the American
loyalists. This however was waived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTWO_DEATH_OF_ROCKINGHAM" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTWO_DEATH_OF_ROCKINGHAM"></a>Death of Rockingham. Division of the Whigs.</div>

<p>The duty of concluding these treaties had not fallen to the same
ministry as had begun them. The composition of the
Rockingham ministry had not been such as to secure its
stability; it consisted, as has been said, of two distinct
and equally balanced parties. A rivalry between the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1111" id="Page_1111">[1111]</a></span>
these parties was inevitable, especially when one of them was a man
so self-asserting and so conscious of his claims as Fox. United for a
moment under the nominal leadership of Rockingham, a man of
great influence though of slender ability, their union was at once
dissolved at the death of that nobleman. Fox refused to serve under
Shelburne, to whom the King at once offered the Premiership, and
though several of the old ministers retained their places, the greater
part followed their leader, and a split, which proved to be final, arose
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_SHELBURNE_RESIGNS" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_SHELBURNE_RESIGNS"></a>The Shelburne ministry. July 1782.</span> between
the two sections of the Whigs. The new ministry included, as Chancellor
of the Exchequer, William Pitt, as yet but twenty-three years of age.
Already his oratorical power and his aspiring genius had made him one of
the first men of the House, and he was regarded as a worthy successor
of Chatham. Till this period he and Fox had been on friendly terms, and
usually on the same side on political questions, but he had his father's
hatred of faction, or the introduction of personal motives into politics,
and bitterly reproached Fox for his conduct in leaving the Government.
Henceforward they were avowed opponents. Fox's own explanation of his
conduct was as follows. He said that he had written by the King's orders
to Mr. Grenville, then at Paris, to authorize him to offer to the
American agents "to recognize the independence of the United States in
the first instance, and not to reserve it as a condition of peace." At
the same time an official letter, for the same purpose, was sent by the
Earl of Shelburne to Sir Guy Carleton in America. Mr. Fox, suspecting
that this measure though consented to in the Cabinet, had not the entire
approbation of some of his colleagues, had, in order to prevent any
misconception, purposely chosen the most forcible expressions that the
English language could supply; and he confessed that his joy was so
great on finding that the Earl of Shelburne, in the letter to Sir Guy
Carleton, had repeated his very words, that he carried it immediately
to the Marquis of Rockingham, and told him that their distrust and
suspicions of that noble lord's intentions had been groundless, and were
now done away. "Judge then," said he, "of my grief and astonishment when,
during the illness of my noble friend, another language was heard in the
Cabinet, and the noble Earl and his friends began to consider the above
letter as containing offers only of a conditional nature, to be recalled
if not accepted as the price of peace. Finding myself thus ensnared and
betrayed, and all confidence destroyed, I quitted a situation in which I
found I could not remain either with honour or safety."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1112" id="Page_1112">[1112]</a></span></p>

<p>The Whig love of office had not been satiated by an eight months'
tenure of it, nor had Lord North's party taken kindly to their loss
of power, and in their greedy desire for personal aggrandizement, the
leaders, who a few months before were speaking of each other as the
most corrupt of the human species, found it consistent with their
dignity to combine to eject Lord Shelburne's Government. They
chose as their test question the terms of the peace. Lord North,
probably, conscientiously believed that they might have been more
favourable. Fox had himself offered much larger concessions to
Holland, and had not disapproved either of the American or French
terms, nor did he now offer the smallest suggestion as to what better
terms might have been procured. In parliamentary influence, however,
the coalition was quite irresistible, and at the opening of the
session in the spring Lord Shelburne found himself in a minority
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTYTHREE_SHELBURNE_RESIGNS" id="EIGHTYTHREE_SHELBURNE_RESIGNS"></a>The coalition ministry under Portland. April
1783.</span> upon resolutions which had been moved condemnatory
of the peace. He at once resigned. After a few
ineffectual struggles the King had to accept the coalition
ministry. Nothing could have been more distasteful to him; he
found himself suddenly robbed of the whole advantage of twenty years
of political scheming; he had triumphed on the fall of the Chatham
administration, and for years had been served, as he would wish to
be served, by a very able, popular, upright, but obsequious minister,
only now to be thrown back, apparently bound hand and foot, into
the hands of the hated Whig oligarchy. His policy had produced a
disastrous war, an enormous augmentation of the National Debt, and
an all but universal cry for a better system of economical government
and national representation; while the Whigs, taking advantage of
the opportunity which the ill success of royal Government gave
them, had succeeded in regaining, as it appeared, an unassailable
superiority. In parliamentary influence they were overwhelming;
they numbered among their party Fox and North, the two ablest
debaters in the House, and Burke, the greatest orator. They had
also the long official experience of Lord North's party. Against
them were the few remaining members of the old Chatham party,
with no influence on which to rely, and upheld almost solely by the
brilliant promise of young Pitt. The nominal head of the new
Government was the Duke of Portland, for, as usual with coalitions,
a man of no great ability was elected as the nominal chief. Fox and
North were equal Secretaries of State, Lord John Cavendish was
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Cabinet was completed by Lord
Keppel, Carlisle, and Stormont. The great strength of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1113" id="Page_1113">[1113]</a></span>
ministry was speedily shown; a second Bill for parliamentary
reform was rejected by the large majority of 144.</p>

<p>This ministry, which seemed so irresistible, was doomed to be of
short duration, and the factious movement, which seemed to have
thwarted for ever the policy of the King, proved in the sequel the
means of establishing his policy for the rest of the reign. The cause
of this sudden change of fortune was the necessity for some legislation
with regard to the affairs of India, but before relating the final
struggle it will be necessary to give a brief sketch of the course of
events in that country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_HUNDRED_FOUNDATION_OF_THE_EAST_INDIA_COMPANY" id="SIXTEEN_HUNDRED_FOUNDATION_OF_THE_EAST_INDIA_COMPANY"></a>Sketch of the history of India.</div>

<p>For this purpose the history can be broken conveniently into two
periods. There are two classes of difficulties which the English have
had to overcome. First, the rivalry with other European nations, and
secondly, the opposition to their gradual encroachment offered by the
native chiefs and native tribes. The first of these periods may be
held to close at the Peace of 1763, and includes the formation and
establishment by the English of the three Presidencies of Bombay,
Madras, and Bengal, and the practical destruction of all other European
influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation of the India Company. 1600.</div>

<p>The India Company sprang into existence in the first year of the
seventeenth century. In December 1600, the Indian Adventurers were formed
into a chartered company, their monopoly being at first granted for
fifteen years, and subsequently in 1609 rendered perpetual, but revocable
at three years' notice from the Government. It was the intention of the
Company to dispute the trade of the East with two nations who had already
made good their position there. The discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in
1497 by the Portuguese under Vasco da Gama, had been followed by nearly
a century during which Portugal showed extreme energy both in arms, in
literature, and in mercantile pursuits. The western coast of India, from
Goa northwards to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, was more or less completely
conquered by the Portuguese from the native rajahs. In 1580, Portugal
was conquered by the Spaniards; its greatness was at an end. The Dutch
had already established important factories both in India itself and in
the Spice Islands, and had with success contested with the Portuguese
their monopoly of the Indian trade. It was in emulation of the Dutch, and
taking advantage of the depression of Portugal, and in pursuance also
of their systematic opposition to Spain, that the English Company was
formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1114" id="Page_1114">[1114]</a></span></p>

<p>At first this trade was small but very lucrative. The attention of
the Company was chiefly directed to the exclusion of interlopers, or
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SIXTEEN_FORTY_FOUNDATION_OF_MADRAS" id="SIXTEEN_FORTY_FOUNDATION_OF_MADRAS"></a>Foundation of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta.</span>
free traders, who interfered with their monopoly. Their chief factories
were Surat, near Bombay, which brought them into immediate conflict
with the Portuguese, against whom they assisted the native princes, and
Bantam, in Java, which placed them in conflict with the Dutch, at whose
hands, in 1623, they suffered the famous outrage known as the Massacre of
Amboyna, where ten Englishmen were put to death upon their confession of
conspiracy against the Dutch extorted by torture. Both these positions
were obviously inconvenient, and tended to permanent hostilities. Some
more secure situation was desirable, and in 1640 the Rajah of the
Carnatic allowed the Company to purchase ground close to the deserted
Portuguese settlement of St. Thomé; and the Fort of St. George and the
town of Madras rapidly rose to importance. This town took the place of
Bantam. The marriage-treaty of Charles II. with Catherine of Braganza
gave the town and island of Bombay to the English, and it took the
place of Surat. In Bengal all three rival powers had factories upon the
Hooghly, a branch of the Ganges. Not long after the transference of their
business from Surat to Bombay the English became involved in some petty
hostilities in Bengal, and were compelled to resign their factory, and
found a home lower down the river at a village called Chutternuttee. They
were in fact in great danger of being driven from the country, but they
managed to mollify the anger of Aurungzebe, who was at that time on the
throne of the Moguls, and in 1698 obtained a lease of the village, there
built Fort William, and founded the town of Calcutta. The Revolution in
England threatened for a time to destroy the India Company. A great rival
company, called the New India Company, was formed, and was supported by
the majority of the Commons. But finally, in 1708, the quarrels were
adjusted, and the Companies coalesced to prevent the destruction of
both, which threatened to follow their eager competition. Their whole
capital was made to consist of £3,200,000, lent to Government at five per
cent.; and they had the right of borrowing one million and a half more.
Repeated prolongations of their privileges were made; in 1712 to 1736, in
1730 to 1769, in 1743 to 1783. Their three settlements formed separate
presidencies or seats of government, unconnected one with the other, each
governed by a president and <span class="sidenote">Decline of Portuguese
and Dutch competition.</span> council. Events in Europe had practically
destroyed the rivalry of Portugal, which had lost its energy, and
moreover, in its dislike of Spain, had become the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1115" id="Page_1115">[1115]</a></span>
ally of the English. The stress even of the Dutch competition was
very greatly slackened. That country also, in its dread of France, was
generally friendly to England, and from the position of its settlements
its commercial importance was rather in the islands than in
the mainland of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_DECLINE_OF_THE_MOGUL_EMPIRE" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVEN_DECLINE_OF_THE_MOGUL_EMPIRE"></a>Decline of the Mogul Empire. 1707.</div>

<p>Aurungzebe had died in 1707, after a very long and glorious reign.
He was the most successful of that line of Indian Emperors generally
spoken of as Great Moguls, and the inheritor of a vast empire founded
by Baber, a descendant of Timor the Tartar, who died in 1530, but whose
work was carried on by his successors, notably by the great Emperor
Akbar, whose reign ended in 1605. Aurungzebe carried the arms of this
victorious empire, now stationed at Delhi, over nearly all the mainland
and peninsula of India. His chief opponent was Sivajee, the founder of
the Mahratta dynasty. This chief, who was never conquered, died young
in 1680. On his death for a time the glories of the Mahratta dynasty
declined. The head of this people, the Rajah of Satara, like other
Eastern monarchs, became merely a nominal ruler, his Peishwa or Prime
Minister, whose abode was Poona, became the real head of the race, but
like by far the greater part of the Hindoo rulers of India, the Peishwa
acknowledged the supremacy of the Mogul Empire. Wherever the Mahommedan
arms had been really victorious, the provinces were in the charge of
Subahdars, or Viceroys of the Emperor; the great bulk of the Peninsula,
known as the Deccan, being in the hands of the greatest of their
Viceroys, called the Nizam. The death of Aurungzebe was the signal for
the dissolution of this great power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFOUR_COMPETITION_WITH_THE_FRENCH_COMPANY" id="SEVENTEEN_FOURTYFOUR_COMPETITION_WITH_THE_FRENCH_COMPANY"></a>Competition with the French Company.</div>

<p>In the midst of the prevalent dissolution a new and most dangerous
rival of the English Company arose. This was the
French Company which had been established under
Louis XIV., and which, like the English and Dutch, had
an establishment upon the Hooghly called Chandernagore; a settlement
eighty miles south of Madras called Pondicherry; and to represent
our settlement on the Malabar coast, the two islands of the Mauritius
or Isle of France, and the Isle of Bourbon, won respectively from
the Dutch and Portuguese. In 1744, when the Companies first came
into active competition, two men of great genius were at the head of
the French Presidencies; Labourdonnais at the Mauritius, and Dupleix
at Pondicherry. The dissolution of the Mogul Empire has been not
inaptly compared to the break-up of the Western Empire of Charles
the Great. All the provincial governors who were at all in a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1116" id="Page_1116">[1116]</a></span>
to do so, while keeping up for a time their nominal dependence upon
the central court of Delhi, rendered themselves practically independent.
It was of this state of dissolution that Dupleix, with singular
ability, took advantage. As he gazed upon the shattered fragments
of the decaying empire, on the rising independence of Hindoo rajah,
mogul and nabob, and observed the constantly increasing power of
the Mahrattas from the Western Ghauts, Dupleix formed the opinion
that India was not for the natives, but for European conquerors, and
as Dutch enterprise had sought another direction, and Portugal was
<span class="sidenote">Grandeur of Dupleix's schemes.</span>
a failing power, the only countries that could compete
for the high position were France and England. Having
settled upon his opponents, he settled also upon his
means of offence. The French Company and its officers must become
at once the nominal feudatories of the Mogul Empire, and without
present conquest must so mingle in all the affairs of the native
princes, and so assist them by means of native levies drilled in the
European fashion, as virtually to master them all. In other words, he
invented that system by the application of which the English power
has subsequently been formed. The war of the Austrian Succession,
which broke out in 1744, supplied him with his opportunity. A network
of alliances was formed around the English settlement, and kept
together by the skill of Dupleix and of his wife, a woman of Portuguese
extraction and of extraordinary talents. But Dupleix's activity was
crossed by the equal energy of Labourdonnais, who, with a fleet
hastily gathered, captured Madras. The English inhabitants surrendered
upon terms, the town was to be repurchased for £440,000.
This was in strict accordance with the views of the French Government,
but not in accordance with the views of Dupleix, who wished to
drive the English from the Peninsula. A hot dispute arose between
the two governors. Dupleix induced Labourdonnais to withdraw
upon a false promise of surrendering Madras; and Labourdonnais
returning to France, was there, with the ingratitude the French
always showed to their colonial governors, subjected to several years
of imprisonment and a trial, which was the immediate cause of his
death. Retaining Madras, and with the aid of the Nabob of Arcot,
Dupleix was proceeding, in 1747, to complete his conquest by the
capture of Fort St. David. The approach of the English fleet saved
the fortress, and even enabled the English to make a counter attack
upon Pondicherry. It failed, and the fame of Dupleix and the French
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTY_SUCCESS_OF_DUPLEIX" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTY_SUCCESS_OF_DUPLEIX"></a>Success of Dupleix.</span>
was at its height among the natives when the Peace of
1748 compelled the restitution of conquests. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1117" id="Page_1117">[1117]</a></span>
plans of Dupleix were such that no war between the nations was
necessary to enable him to carry them on. It was native quarrels he
desired, and such quarrels arose at the death of the old Nizam El Mulk
of the Deccan. His throne was disputed by his son Nazir Jung and
his grandson Mirzapha Jung. At the same time Chunda Sahib
appeared as a claimant for the viceroyalty of the Carnatic. Both the
pretenders found their cause adopted by Dupleix, who understood well
how secure his position would be did he succeed in establishing by
his own power a Nizam of the Deccan and a Nabob of the Carnatic.
Aided by the Marquis de Bussy, as great as a soldier as Dupleix was
as a diplomatist, in 1749 the pretenders and the French won a victory
at Amboor, in which the reigning nabob was killed. His son,
Mahomet Ali, took the title of Nabob of Arcot, but was obliged to
retire to Trichinopoly, while the whole country was in the hands of his
rival. Thus successful in arms in the Carnatic, Dupleix was equally
so by intrigue in the Deccan. In 1750, as the French approached
Nazir Jung's army, a conspiracy which Dupleix had hatched broke
out, and Nazir was murdered. Mirzapha acknowledged his debt of
gratitude to the French, and it was at Pondicherry that he entered
upon his rank, rewarding his European allies with the government
of the whole country from Cape Comorin to the Kistna. Dupleix
appeared to have gained his object. The Company of which he was
the governor was accepted as a ruling power in India; the great
princes of the neighbourhood both owed him their crowns. The
only place still holding out against his authority was Trichinopoly,
and thither he directed all his efforts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYTWO_DUPLEIX_DEFEATED_BY_CLIVE" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYTWO_DUPLEIX_DEFEATED_BY_CLIVE"></a>Defeated by Clive.</div>

<p>It was then that England at last found a champion in Robert Clive.
Unable to summon troops sufficient to relieve Trichinopoly, he determined
to attack Arcot as a diversion. The plan succeeded. Arcot fell almost
without a struggle. 10,000 men were detached from the armies of Dupleix
and Chunda Sahib at Pondicherry, but their attempt to recapture Arcot
was a signal failure; and when Clive secured the assistance of a band of
Mahratta horse under Morari Row, the siege was raised, and was followed
by a victory over Rajah Sahib, son of Chunda Sahib. Taking the Pagoda of
Conjeveram on the way, Clive, in 1752, turned towards Fort St. David, but
was recalled to fight Rajah Sahib, whom he again conquered in the battle
of Coverpauk. He was then at leisure, in conjunction with Major Lawrence,
who had come to assume the command, to raise the siege of Trichinopoly;
and when the besiegers were themselves besieged in the islands of Seringham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1118" id="Page_1118">[1118]</a></span>
in the river Cauvery, and when Chunda Sahib was there killed, the
failure of Dupleix's measures was complete. The war indeed continued
some time longer. Bussy upheld the French nominee, Salabat
Jung, in the Deccan; Dupleix still kept up hostilities in the Carnatic.
But as his fortunes failed, his employers deserted him. In 1754 he
was recalled. A treaty was made between the Companies, and
Dupleix died in poverty and misery a few years afterwards in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1753 ill health had compelled Clive to go to England. In 1755
he returned to India as Governor of Fort St. David, of which he took
possession on the 20th June 1756, having on his way assisted in the
destruction of Gheriah, the sea-girt stronghold of the pirate Angria,
who had long been the terror of the Bombay merchants. On the
very day of Clive's arrival at Madras, Surajah Dowlah, the Nabob of
Bengal, a young man of about nineteen years of age, cruel, effeminate,
and debauched, had captured Fort William and Calcutta. Shelter
afforded to a defaulting revenue officer of his, and the increase of the
fortifications of Fort William, roused a quarrel between him and the
English. He advanced upon Calcutta and captured it, and the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_BLACK_HOLE_OF_CALCUTTA" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSIX_THE_BLACK_HOLE_OF_CALCUTTA"></a>The Black Hole of Calcutta. June 1756.</span>
world was horrified by the tragedy of the Black Hole. The prisoners, 146
in number, were thrust into a narrow chamber some twenty feet square,
whence, after a night of unspeakable horrors, but twenty-three wretched
survivors were dragged the following morning before Surajah Dowlah and
sent as prisoners to his capital at Moorshedabad. The horrors of the
Black Hole of Calcutta were beyond expression terrible; the heat of the
night was intense, and as the agonies of thirst and suffocation came upon
them, the prisoners struggled to the windows for a mouthful of fresh air,
careless that they trod to death their fallen comrades; they insulted
the guards in hopes that they would fire upon them; many died in raving
madness. Mr. Holwell, the chief of those who survived, was so broken that
he was unable to walk from the prison. When the news of this fearful
event reached Madras, it was at once determined to take vengeance upon
the Nabob. After some difficulties Clive was appointed to the command,
and though four months were wasted, partly by contrary winds, partly by
the jealousy of the various English commanders, by the middle of January
1757 Calcutta was regained. This success and a night attack upon his army
excited in the mind of the Nabob such a dread of the English that he
consented to enter into an alliance with them. The temporary cessation of
hostilities with the natives and the arrival of reinforcements
gave Clive an opportunity to destroy the French settlement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1119" id="Page_1119">[1119]</a></span>
Chandernagore, although the Nabob, to whom the presence of the
French as a counterpoise to the English was of great importance,
had taken it under his protection. This act of open contempt for
his authority excited Surajah Dowlah's anger anew, and afraid to
oppose the English openly he entered into secret negotiations
with the French, and intreated M. Bussy to march from the
<span class="sidenote">Clive's treaty with Meer Jaffier.</span> Deccan
to his assistance. His intrigues became known, and were met by counter
intrigues: it was determined to depose him, and to place Meer Jaffier,
his general, on the throne; and in order to deceive one of his agents
named Omichund, who threatened to betray the conspiracy unless bribed by
an enormous sum of money, Clive was guilty of forging the name of Admiral
Watson. The treaty to which the false signature was appended promised the
bribe, but was a sham treaty. On the real treaty which Admiral Watson
had signed Omichund received nothing. The plot being ripe, Clive openly
advanced towards Moorshedabad, the Nabob's capital, and on the 23rd June
1757 won <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_THE_BATTLE_OF_PLASSEY" id="SEVENTEEN_FIFTYSEVEN_THE_BATTLE_OF_PLASSEY"></a>Battle of Plassey. June 23, 1757.</span>
with his troops, numbering in all some 3000 men, the great victory of
Plassey over 30,000 of the Nabob's troops. That battle secured the power
of England in Bengal. Surajah Dowlah fled; Meer Jaffier was placed upon
the throne. A sum of nearly £3,000,000 was paid to the Company, to which
was given the entire property of Calcutta itself as far as 600 yards
beyond the Mahratta ditch, and the zemindary or feudal tenure on payment
of rent of all the country between Calcutta and the sea. The English
thus had firm footing in Bengal, and before 1760, when Clive was again
compelled to seek England, he had made two other steps in advance. In
support of Meer Jaffier, he had advanced against and conquered Shah
Allum, the Great Mogul, and for ever freed himself from competition of
the Dutch by capturing the whole of a large squadron which they had sent
to the assistance of their factory at Chinsurah in opposing the advance
of the English.</p>

1761.</div>

<p>The following year saw the final fall of the French power in India.
While Clive was securing Bengal, the breaking out of the Seven Years'
War had renewed the hostilities in the Carnatic. On this occasion Lally
was the champion of the French. But able and vigorous as a soldier,
his ill-usage of the natives, his eager temper and satirical tongue,
surrounded him with disaffection both among the Indians and his own
troops. At first his advent was marked with success. In the course
of 1758 he captured and destroyed Fort St. David and retook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1120" id="Page_1120">[1120]</a></span>
Arcot. But, early in the following year, the disaffection of his troops
and the arrival of Admiral Pocock prevented him from bringing to a
successful issue an assault on Madras, and from this time onwards the
English retained constant superiority. Colonel Coote, a soldier of
Clive's training, took the command; and on the morning of the 22nd
January 1760, won over the French the great battle of Wandewash. The
European troops alone were engaged. It differed from other Indian battles
in this respect, and was a national victory won upon Indian soil. Coote's
sepoys, on congratulating him on his victory, thanked him for having
shown them a battle such as they had never yet seen. The battle of
Wandewash did for Madras what Plassey did for Bengal. The troops of the
English and their allies gradually closed in round Pondicherry, and in
spite of a firm and splendid resistance, that sole remaining stronghold
of the French power surrendered in January 1761; and Lally, like his
predecessors, returned to France only to meet with persecution from his
employers, and finally death upon the scaffold. The Portuguese, Dutch,
and French had thus all disappeared from the political world of India,
though they still kept up trading stations at Pondicherry, Chandernagore,
and Chinsurah. England had secured a sovereign position in its three
Presidencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contest with native states.</div>

<p>The further growth of the Empire was at the expense of native
tribes, and carried on in the midst of strange domestic
mismanagement. The English Government at Calcutta,
left without the guiding hand of Clive, soon drifted into fresh
quarrels with the natives. Mr. Vansittart was left as governor, and
already, in 1760, he had thought it desirable to remove Meer Jaffier,
the Company's creature, from the throne of Moorshedabad, and
replace him by Meer Cossim, his son-in-law. The step was an
unwise one. The new viceroy was of less malleable materials than
his predecessor, and speedily came to look with great anger at the
constant breaches of the revenue laws perpetrated by the English
traders. He quarrelled especially with a gentleman who occupied
the advanced factory of Patna high up the Ganges. To be out of
the influence of Calcutta, he withdrew his capital from Moorshedabad
to Monghir, and all seemed tending towards war. It was in vain
that Mr. Vansittart went himself to Monghir, arranged for the
payment of inland duties, and received as a sign of peace a present
of £70,000. An embassy sent from Calcutta to complete the
pacification was fallen on and murdered at Moorshedabad, and under
the circumstances war became inevitable. The advance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1121" id="Page_1121">[1121]</a></span>
English was rapid and triumphant; Moorshedabad fell, and after a
nine days' siege Monghir itself was taken. The Nabob found it
necessary to fly, but before he fled, with the assistance of a renegade
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTHREE_MASSACRE_OF_PATNA" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYTHREE_MASSACRE_OF_PATNA"></a>Massacre of Patna. 1763.</span> Frenchman called
Sombre, he committed a crime similar to that of the Black Hole of
Calcutta. On the 5th October 1763 the whole of the English residents of
the Patna factory (150 in number), enclosed within their prison walls,
were shot down or cut to pieces, and their mangled remains thrown into
two wells. One alone escaped. The Rajah and his instrument Sombre fled
into the district of a neighbouring nabob, Sujah Dowlah of Oude, at
whose court was tarrying, in a condition between exile and prisoner, the
Mogul Shah Allum, who had been driven from his throne at Delhi by the
advance of the Mahrattas. Sujah Dowlah had been appointed vizier, and
virtually wielded all the power that was left to the descendants of the
Moguls. With these allies Sujah Dowlah advanced to meet the English,
and suffered, <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFOUR_BATTLE_OF_BUXAR" id="SEVENTEEN_SIXTYFOUR_BATTLE_OF_BUXAR"></a>Battle of Buxar. Oct. 1764.</span>
on the 23rd of October, at Buxar, higher up the river than Patna, a
terrible defeat at the hands of Major Munro. The fruit of the victory
was the person of Shah Allum himself, and backed now by his authority,
the English pressing on in their victorious course, the following year
entered Allahabad, the chief city of Oude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maladministration of the Company.</div>

<p>Victory in war and increased dominion had only increased the
maladministration of the India Company, which reached
such a pitch, that in 1765 it became necessary again to
despatch Clive to the scene of action. This was not
done without the most vigorous opposition. Two great parties had
long divided the India House in London. Mr. Sullivan had for some
time exercised a paramount authority there. Clive had appeared
as his rival. Both parties lavished their wealth in creating votes, and
a factious struggle arose in the heart of the Company. At length
the general voice seemed to declare that Clive alone could restore
order in the mismanaged Presidency. Clive saw his opportunity.
He publicly refused to go out as long as Sullivan occupied the place
of chairman of the Court of Directors. The proprietors were so
frightened by this threat, that when the day of election of directors
arrived, Sullivan found himself unable to carry more than half of
<span class="sidenote">Clive returns to India. May 1765.</span>
his list of directors, and Clive's friends were triumphant. He was sent
out with full powers, and authorized to override the opinion of the
Council, although usually the governor was entitled to only one vote. The
struggle for bribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1122" id="Page_1122">[1122]</a></span>
and ill-gotten gain was carried on to the moment of his arrival. Only
a few days before he landed the viceroyalty of Bengal had been sold,
contrary to all justice, to the illegitimate son of Meer Jaffier for
£140,000. But the scene was speedily changed. In two days Clive and the
Committee who accompanied him had mastered the state of affairs and
declared their dictatorial authority. At the dread of his name alone
Sujah Dowlah sought peace. He compelled Meer Cossim and his agent Sombre,
who had organized the massacre of Patna, to leave his dominions, and a
treaty was made in accordance with Clive's view, that for the present
it was better to strengthen than increase our dominions. By this treaty
Sujah Dowlah retained his provinces, surrendering only the districts
of Corah and Allahabad, which were given as an imperial dominion to
Shah Allum. In return the provinces of Bengal, Orissa, and Bahar, were
granted for all administrative purposes to the Company, who thus became
nominal as well as real princes of India. The Nabob of Bengal was
pensioned with a yearly income. This was the beginning of a system which
played a great part in our Indian history. By this means the Company
were secured a revenue of two millions. But even yet Clive thought it
imprudent to place the administration in European hands, and selected
as native Prime Minister a Mahommedan, Mahomed Reza Khan. This choice
was made deliberately, in spite of the claims of Nuncomar, the chief of
the Bengal Brahmins. The rivalry between these two chiefs bore notable
fruit afterwards. Having settled our difficulties with the natives,
Clive turned to domestic reforms; he deprived the military of a large
allowance, called "double batta," which they had received from Meer
Jaffier, and quelled, with incomparable vigour and sagacity, a mutiny
which arose in consequence; he forbade civilians to receive presents from
the native princes, and restrained officials from engaging in private
trading, while he himself set an admirable example of disinterestedness.
Unfortunately he was unable to superintend the execution of his plans,
but was compelled by ill health to return to England (Jan. 1767).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SITXYNINE_RISE_OF_HYDER_ALI" id="SEVENTEEN_SITXYNINE_RISE_OF_HYDER_ALI"></a>Affairs in Madras; rise of Hyder Ali.</div>

<p>While the events that have been mentioned were going on in Bengal,
the southern Presidency had had its own difficulties to contend with.
Immediately above the plains of the Carnatic lies the hill country of
Mysore, and there a new power had been established by the ablest opponent
we ever met in India, Hyder Ali. A Mahommedan of low birth, a freebooter,
a rebel, and commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, he succeeded
at last in establishing himself on the throne of the Hindoo Rajah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1123" id="Page_1123">[1123]</a></span>
Sometimes in confederation with the Nizam of the Deccan, sometimes with
the Mahrattas of the Western Ghauts, Hyder kept up a continual war with
the English. His army of 100,000 men was organized in the European
fashion. Though unable to write, his retentive memory enabled him to be a
most dangerous diplomatist, and though beaten in the field, his activity
kept the English army in constant movement and exhausted the Company's
resources. To such an extent was this the case, that Clive's reforms were
counterbalanced, and in 1769 Indian stock fell sixty per cent.</p>

<p>Such threatening appearances in the commercial career of the Company,
the constant scandal of their factious struggle in London, and
the anomaly becoming every day more striking of a body of merchants
exercising, and exercising very badly, sovereign rights over large
conquered districts, excited the attention of Parliament. Chatham,
as has been mentioned, intended to have enforced the rights of the
Crown; and the Company only escaped some interference of the kind
by offering to establish supervisors of its own and to pay the English
Government £400,000 a year. But in 1773 matters had become
much worse; a fearful famine had devastated Bengal, corpses choked
and infected the Ganges, the fish and fowl became uneatable, more
than half the population are said to have been swept away. It was
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTY_FAMINE_IN_BENGAL" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTY_FAMINE_IN_BENGAL"></a>Famine in Bengal. 1770.</span> felt that no
properly conducted Government could have permitted such an evil; and
when in 1772 the united effects of the Madras wars and the Bengal
famine reduced the funds of the Company to so low an ebb that they
had to demand of Parliament a loan of a million sterling, legislation
became inevitable. At the beginning of the year a Committee of inquiry
had reported, and again in the autumn another secret committee had
been named; upon their report Lord North formed what is known as the
Regulating <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTHREE_THE_REGULATING_ACT" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYTHREE_THE_REGULATING_ACT"></a>Regulating Act, 1773.</span> Act. By
this he granted the Company their loan, relieved them of their annual
tribute to the State, and allowed them to export their bonded tea, with
what disastrous effects in America has been already seen. In exchange
he confined their interest to six per cent. till the loan was paid, and
afterwards to eight per cent.; and, proceeding to the organization of
their government, he established a supreme court upon the English model,
made the Governor of Bengal Governor-General of India, and appointed by
name in Parliament a new Council. Warren Hastings, already Governor of
Bengal, was made the first Governor-General; Barwell, a member of the
existing Council, was continued in his office;
General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Philip Francis, were named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1124" id="Page_1124">[1124]</a></span>
as the new members. During the discussions relative to this Act
much blame had been thrown on Clive, and though a formal vote
of censure was mollified by the words, that "Robert Lord Clive did
at the same time render great and meritorious services to his country,"
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_DEATH_OF_CLIVE" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYFOUR_DEATH_OF_CLIVE"></a>Death of Clive.</span> the trouble he underwent
preyed upon a morbid mind and a body weakened by disease so much that he
committed suicide (Nov. 1774).</p>

<p>The interest which has hitherto centred upon Clive is now transferred
to the career of Warren Hastings. An Indian statesman
by profession, and thoroughly acquainted with the wants both of
native and European populations, he had entered upon the duties of
the Government of Bengal in 1772. The post was not a light one:
in India a people in the last stages of distress, a Government full of
abuses, a small dominant population who believed their sole duty
was to acquire wealth rapidly; in England a factious and fluctuating
body of governors whose chief object was high dividends. Such
<span class="sidenote">Hastings Governor-General.</span> were the
conditions under which Hastings had to act. A change in the management of
the land tax produced a larger revenue with less oppression; the country,
freed from marauders, was in a better condition to pay taxes; but this
was little. Rumours were afloat that Reza Khan, the finance minister,
was peculating largely. On the accusation of Nuncomar, his old rival, he
was apprehended by Hastings, who either believed the charges or acted in
obedience to the Company's orders. On examination he was acquitted, but
not replaced in his office, nor was Nuncomar appointed to succeed him;
the administration was kept in English hands. The Viceroy, an infant, was
deprived of half his allowance, and a quarrel having arisen between our
old ally Shah Allum, who had made friends with the Mahrattas, and the
English, Allahabad and Corah were resumed and sold to the Vizier of Oude
for fifty lacs of rupees. More than that, for a further sum of forty lacs
English troops were basely let to that prince to destroy his enemies,
the neighbouring Afghan conquerers of Rohilcund. All these measures seem
to have been dictated primarily by a desire for an increased revenue.
It was at this crisis that the Regulating Act took effect, and the new
councillors arrived in the Hooghly. The man of the most importance and
activity among them was Philip Francis, who is now generally accepted as
being the author of "Junius' Letters." The other two always voted with
him, and all three came out with strong prejudices
and a determination to oppose Hastings. The new Governor-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1125" id="Page_1125">[1125]</a></span>
therefore found himself at once in a permanent minority, for, as before,
he had but one vote in the Council. Barwell, the Indian member of the
new Council, always voted with him. There arose therefore a fierce
struggle for power, and the new councillors made haste to seek on all
sides grounds for attacking Hastings. It was understood that they were
willing to receive any charges against him. Nuncomar, who had been
heavily disappointed at not receiving the vacant place of Reza Khan,
charged him with having been bribed to pardon that great official; and
Francis and his partisans determined to confront Nuncomar with Hastings
at the council board. The Governor-General rightly refused to preside at
what was virtually his own trial; but upon his dissolving the Council the
three new members declared it not dissolved, and continued the inquiry.
Fortune placed in the hands of Hastings the means of freeing himself
from this awkward dilemma. A private charge of forgery was brought
against Nuncomar, and he was tried before the new supreme court. It
is impossible to say how far this charge was fostered by Hastings, he
himself asserted upon oath that he had nothing whatever to do with it;
at all events it was carried to its conclusion, and Sir Elijah Impey
and his colleagues found the charge proved, and condemned Nuncomar to
death. Impey, an old schoolfellow of Hastings, whose career showed him
not to be above suspicion, is by many held to have acted corruptly; but
his colleagues entirely agreed with him, nor does it seem that he did
anything worse than import into India the habits and feelings of Europe
when he suffered the sentence of death to be carried out. No doubt this
was a shock to the moral feelings of the Hindoos, to whom forgery was
not the grave offence that it is to us. However this may be, the death
of Nuncomar secured the supremacy of Hastings. There was no one brave
enough to bring charges either true or false against one whose vengeance
seemed to have struck down the head of their religion. His supremacy was
soon still further secured; by the death of Monson he found himself, by
means of his own casting vote, master of the Council. One more violent
struggle took place, after which he was able to act according to his own
judgment, although constantly thwarted by Francis. In the height of his
difficulties he had lodged a conditional resignation with his agent in
London, and his agent, alarmed by the news from India, had presented it.
Suddenly, in the midst of his triumph in Calcutta, a ship arrived with a
new member of the Council and the news that the Governor-General had
resigned. Hastings positively refused to ratify the act of his agent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">[1126]</a></span>
which he declared was unauthorized by him. The bitter contest which arose
from this subject was brought before the Supreme Court of Justice for
arbitration. Sir Elijah Impey again settled the question in Hastings'
favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His opposition to the Mahrattas.</div>

<p>Hastings could now turn his thoughts to what was his constant object,
the aggrandizement of our power in India, and his view seems to have
been to enter into close alliances with the great Mahommedan Princes,
the Nabob-Vizier of Oude and the Nizam of the Deccan, to render them
dependent on the English by means of large subsidies, and by their
assistance oppose an effectual barrier to the great and increasing power
of the Mahrattas, whom he regarded as the most dangerous rivals to the
English. Affairs in the dependent Presidency of Madras gave him an
opportunity for carrying out this policy. Mismanagement and peculation
had been as rife there as in Bengal. The Rajah of Tanjore, a Mahratta
prince, had been dispossessed in favour of the Nabob of Arcot, an old
ally of the English. This measure was disallowed by the directors at
home. Lord Pigot was sent out as governor to re-establish the Rajah. The
same struggle between the Governor and his Council as had been seen in
Calcutta took place in Madras, but proceeded to even greater extremities.
The Council arrested Lord Pigot, who died a prisoner in their hands. Thus
the policy of restitution was crushed, and the claims of the Mahratta
Rajah of Tanjore were neglected. In Bombay, too, constant disputes had
arisen with the Mahratta chiefs of Poonah, so that the whole of that
great confederacy was ready for war. To appreciate the importance of
such a war, it must be remembered that the Mahrattas had spread over
much of India. The descendants of Sivajee, like the descendants of most
Indian conquerors, had sunk into <i>rois fainéants</i> at Satara, delegating
their real power to their viceroy, called the Peishwa of Poonah, whose
office was hereditary. Dependent offshoots of this power had established
themselves in the hills of the Malwa under the great princes Sindia and
Holkar; in Berar under a prince called the Bonslah, in Gujerat under the
Guicowar, and in the extreme south in Tanjore; while bands of Mahratta
horsemen had, as we have seen, seized upon Delhi, and expelled for a
time Shah Allum, the Great Mogul, who had however made terms with them,
and was now again seated upon his ancestral throne. With this vast
power, already on bad terms with both the southern Presidencies, it was
discovered that the French were intriguing. With his usual vigour Hastings
was determined to forestall war, which he saw was inevitable. For this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1127" id="Page_1127">[1127]</a></span>
in spite of the opposition of his Council, an army was at once despatched
southward to act through Bundelcund. The command was given to Colonel
Goddard. But Hastings, who seldom acted a straightforward part,
intrigued at the same time with the Bonslah and with Rajonaut Rao, a
deposed Peishwa, now a refugee in Bombay. Upon the news that France and
England had declared war, still further energy was infused into military
affairs; and Chandernagore, near Calcutta, and Pondicherry, just south
of Madras, two French settlements, were captured. The Mahratta war was
not without its reverses. The Bombay army was surrounded near Poonah,
and escaped only on ignominious terms; but Goddard upheld the honour of
the English arms, and defeated Sindia and Holkar, while Captain Popham
took the almost impregnable castle of Gwalior. The war was regarded as of
sufficient importance to require the presence of the veteran General Sir
Eyre Coote, who was despatched from England to take the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hastings' policy thwarted by Hyder Ali's
advance.</div>

<p>But all prospect of carrying out the ambitious schemes of Hastings for
subjugating the Mahrattas was suddenly clouded. News arrived in 1780 that
Hyder Ali, who had long been watching his opportunity, had pounced upon
Madras. He saw the English engaged in a vast Indian war, he knew that
their arms were not successful in America, he expected the speedy arrival
of a large French force, his time had come at last, and he flung himself
in irresistible numbers upon the Carnatic. The English were virtually
taken by surprise; one army under Colonel Baylie was destroyed, a second
under Sir Hector Munro saved itself by rapid flight. In a moment Hastings
comprehended the new situation of affairs; the news reached Calcutta
on the 23rd of September, on the 25th he was ready with a complete new
plan of operations. He offered peace and alliance to the Mahrattas; he
embarked all available troops for Madras; in virtue of the supremacy of
Bengal, he ventured to suspend Whitewell, the incompetent Governor of
Madras; he gave the command to Sir Eyre Coote, and sent also vast sums of
money thither. It was to sustain this great effort, without if possible
diminishing the gains of the Company, that Hastings committed the rest
of those acts of oppression which were afterwards alleged against him.
To supply the greed of his employers he had sold British troops to <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYEIGHT_THE_MYSORE_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_SEVENTYEIGHT_THE_MYSORE_WAR"></a>Conclusion of the Mysore war.</span>
destroy the Rohillas; in his great struggle for power he
had strained the law in the case of Nuncomar; to support
his Mahratta and Mysore wars he stooped to actions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1128" id="Page_1128">[1128]</a></span>
injustice and cruelty. The return of Sir Eyre Coote re-established
affairs at Madras, he won a great victory at Porta Novo and a second at
Pollilore. The general peace in 1783 put a conclusion to the war, which
had been continued by Tippoo upon the death of his father Hyder Ali.
Hastings had succeeded in concluding a treaty with the Mahrattas, and had
his hands free for carrying on with energy operations against Mysore, the
Dutch, and the French fleet under De Suffren. All the Dutch settlements
had been captured; five great indecisive battles had been fought between
De Suffren and Sir Edward Hughes; but no striking advantages had been
won over Tippoo, who had even met with some successes on the Malabar
coast. With the European nations terms had been arranged in France; with
Tippoo a peace was made on the conditions of the mutual restorations of
conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTY_ROBBERY_OF_CHEYTE_SINGH" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTY_ROBBERY_OF_CHEYTE_SINGH"></a>Robbery of Cheyte Singh.</div>

<p>To return to the conduct of Hastings. On the first alarm of war
with Hyder Ali, he had demanded troops from Cheyte Singh, the Rajah of
Benares, as from a feudatory of the Empire. This demand was annually
renewed, together with the customary tribute of £50,000. Upon this being
delayed it was raised to £500,000. This was still unpaid when Hastings
determined to make a personal visit to Benares. He entered the city with
an absurdly inadequate guard, and put Cheyte Singh under arrest; an
insurrection was the consequence, and Hastings was for a time confined to
his house by the populace and in imminent danger of his life. Perfectly
calm and unmoved in the midst of his dangers, he yielded not one step; he
succeeded in letting the neighbouring troops hear of his danger; Major
Popham came to his rescue, and routed the people of Benares; Cheyte Singh
was driven from his country, a new rajah, with a much enlarged tribute,
was put in his place; his fortress at Bidzegur and all his property was
seized. Hastings at once proceeded to similar acts in Oude. He entered
into a nefarious compact with the Nabob to rob his mother and grandmother
of their money. These two ladies lived at Fyzabad, the ancient capital
of Sujah Dowlah; his son, the reigning Nabob Asaph Ul Dowlah,
<span class="sidenote">Robbery of the Begums of Oude.</span> had
withdrawn to the new city of Lucknow. The Begums possessed large landed
property and Sujah Dowlah's treasure; it was agreed between Hastings and
Asaph Ul Dowlah that this should be taken from them, the landed property
going to the Nabob, the money being received as payment for heavy arrears
due from the Nabob to the English. A lengthened siege and partial famine
did not effect the purpose of the plunderers; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">[1129]</a></span>
found necessary to seize, to imprison, to starve, and torture two aged
eunuchs, the princesses' chief friends and ministers, before treasure
to the amount of about a million could be wrung from them; the excuse
alleged for such unmitigated wickedness was that the Begums had intrigued
for an insurrection in Oude. Again Sir Elijah Impey was on the spot to
give his voice in favour of Hastings when the rumours on which these
charges were based were submitted to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Displeasure in England.</div>

<p>Whatever excuses might be found for such actions, in the difficulties
of Hastings' position and the peculiarity of Indian
habits, it was certain that the condition and rights of
a Company which had become a sovereign ruler, and was at once
under the necessity of demanding a loan to avoid bankruptcy, and
guilty of what could not but sound to English ears as acts of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYONE_PARLIAMENTARY_INQUIRY" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYONE_PARLIAMENTARY_INQUIRY"></a>Parliamentary inquiry. 1781.</span>
cruellest oppression, must form a chief topic of parliamentary
discussion. Accordingly, in 1781, two committees
had been formed to inquire into the affairs of
India. Their reports were strongly condemnatory of the Company's
government, and the Secretary of State for the time being accordingly
demanded Hastings' recall. To this the directors, as by law they had
a right to do, refused to listen, but the matter could not be
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_DUNDAS_INDIA_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYTHREE_DUNDAS_INDIA_BILL"></a>Dundas's Bill. 1783.</span>
dropped, and immediately after the formation of the
coalition ministry Mr. Dundas produced a Bill for the
regulation of India. His view was that the Governor-General's
power should be increased, and the office given to some great
independent nobleman such as Lord Cornwallis. Not only was
this Bill regarded as a party measure, and by no means of sufficient
breadth for its object, but also it was felt that the subject was one
which should be handled by Government itself. In pursuance
<span class="sidenote">Fox's India Bill. Nov.</span>
of this view, in the autumn session of the same year
Fox brought forward his great India Bill. The faults
to be remedied were sufficiently obvious; a trading company had by
a strange turn of fortune become a governor of large provinces, and
had again and again engaged in extensive wars. It was plain that
the functions of the merchant and the governor were not only
distinct but antagonistic. The claims of the proprietors for large
dividends, and the duty of the directors to work for the financial
benefit of their employers, was certain to blind them to acts of
injustice which had a tendency to fill their coffers. The main
principle of any great India Bill must have been the resumption by
the Crown of its inherent Imperial rights, which it had suffered
accidentally to fall into disuse. Accordingly, Fox proposed that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1130" id="Page_1130">[1130]</a></span>
the authority which the Company had exercised should be transferred
to a body of seven commissioners, nominated in Parliament and
capable of holding office for four years, after which the vacancies
occurring in that body were to be filled up by the Crown. To them,
as trustees, was to be transferred also the whole property of the
Company. But the management of this property and the commerce
of the Company was placed in the hands of a subordinate council of
directors, proprietors each of them of £2000 stock, acting under and
subject to the orders of the superior council. The vacancies in the subordinate
council were to be filled by the Court of proprietors. There
were additional stipulations for the purpose of checking monopolies,
the acceptance of presents, the hiring out of British forces, and changes
in the tenure of land, regulations in fact attempting to remove the
principal known abuses of the Indian Government. The Bill was a
thorough and great Bill, and the magnitude of the subject, and the
freedom which the Government enjoyed from any party pledges in
the matter, should have raised it out of the sphere of party politics,
<span class="sidenote">Objections to it.</span>
but it was at once furiously assaulted. There were
raised against it two objections, corresponding to the
two councils which it proposed to erect. First, it was urged that it
was incompatible with the dignity of the Crown that patronage so
enormous as that of India should be vested even for a time in any
hands but those of the King himself.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As Lord Thurlow said, when
the Bill was before the House of Lords, "the King will in fact take
the diadem with his own hands and place it on the head of Mr.
Fox." What rendered this defect more glaring was, that the new
committee was named in the Act, and that all seven members of it
were strenuous supporters of the present administration, so that
a fresh and overwhelming source of influence was secured to Mr.
Fox's friends. It was urged, secondly, that even granting the
necessity and wisdom of such a transference of political power, the
establishment of the second council for the management of the
commerce of the Company was a violent and unnecessary infraction of
chartered rights. Bad financial management, as apart from their
political conduct, could not be alleged against the Company, nor did
it seem probable that commerce would be better managed under
the direction of a parliamentary Committee, even though working
through a subordinate council of merchants, than if left exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">[1131]</a></span>
in mercantile hands; besides, no later than 1780, the charter of the
Company had been renewed, and to deprive it of the superintendence of its
own trade was a manifest breach of that charter. Such were the objections
raised by the Opposition, and they were largely echoed in the country,
where the coalition, as is generally the case in England, was highly
unpopular. The feeling out of doors is shown by a well-known caricature
which represents the triumphal procession of Carlo Fox Khan, crowned
and riding on a state elephant. However, the Bill was triumphantly
passed through the House of Commons, where the coalition majority was
overwhelming.</p>

<p>But the King, who hated his ministers, and whose pride was
touched in its tenderest point by this Bill, was determined that it
should never become law; rather than suffer such indignity he
would refuse his assent to the Bill, exerting a prerogative which had
lain dormant since the reign of William III., or take refuge, as he
was fond of threatening, in Hanover. He was saved from either
alternative by a plan suggested to him by Lords Thurlow and Temple,
<span class="sidenote">The King procures its rejection.</span> which,
although open to the charge of being unconstitutional, prevented the Bill
from passing the Upper House. These two noblemen, using the hereditary
right of British Peers to advise their sovereign, drew up and laid before
George a strong memorandum against the Bill, which they called "a plan
to take more than half the royal power, and by that means disable his
Majesty for the rest of his reign;" and Temple suggested that the Bill
might be stopped in the House of Lords if the King would authorize him
to express his wishes. The King upon this supplied him with a paper to
show to any Lord he pleased. The purport of it was, that "his Majesty
allowed Earl Temple to say that whoever voted for the India Bill was not
only not his friend, but would be considered by him as an enemy, and
if those words were not strong enough, Earl Temple might use whatever
words he might deem stronger and more to the purpose." The effect of
this intimation, acting upon the minds of waverers and of those who
prided themselves in the name of King's friends, was to secure a majority
against the Bill. On the 17th of December it was lost by nineteen votes,
Lord Stormont, a member of the ministry voting against it. The King
thus assumed the strange position of <span class="sidenote">His conduct
unconstitutional.</span> the opponent of his own responsible ministers.
In fact, he felt the power of the hated Whigs closing around him, and
thought any measure justifiable which would free him from their
grasp and enable him to assume that position which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1132" id="Page_1132">[1132]</a></span>
been the constant aim of his policy. Moreover, he no doubt relied
somewhat on the unpopularity excited by the coalition, and on the
apparently unprincipled and factious conduct of the united leaders.
That his conduct is incompatible with constitutional monarchy there
can be no doubt. If he disliked his ministers' measures he had one
straightforward course open to him;&mdash;he should have dismissed
them; if their majority was overwhelming, he should have dissolved
Parliament; if he could not command a majority in the new Parliament, he
was bound to submit. An underhand opposition to ministers, who are alone
responsible to the nation, is entirely destructive of that confidence
which is necessary to the very existence of a constitutional monarchy.
Of course the uproar raised in the House of Commons was great. Motion
after motion condemnatory of the action of the King in the House of
Lords was carried by great majorities. The ministry determined that the
<span class="sidenote">Ministers dismissed.</span> responsibility of
removing them should be left to the King, who, perceiving the necessary
consequence of his late step, on the 18th of December, sent the under
secretaries to tell the ministers they were dismissed, refusing even to
see them personally.</p>

<p>The great Whig party and the great following of Lord North being
thus removed from office, it became a question where a ministry was to
be sought. The only party remaining was the little section of Chatham's
followers, headed by the young Pitt, and reinforced by a portion of the
Tories, with whom they may now be considered as incorporated, although
for several years Pitt's policy was decidedly Liberal. To this youth of
twenty-four the King appealed for assistance, <span class="sidenote">Pitt
accepts the Premiership. 1783.</span> and, relying on his own genius, he
had the audacity to accept the struggle, though conscious that he must
be defeated on every division. There followed a scene unparalleled in
parliamentary history. The Cabinet had to be drawn almost exclusively
from the Upper House; Lord Thurlow became Chancellor, Earl Gower
President of the Council, Duke of Rutland Privy Seal, Lord Carmarthen
and Lord Sydney Secretaries of State, and Lord Howe First Lord of the
Admiralty, and this, with Mr. Pitt himself, was the whole Cabinet. In
the House of Commons he could rely only on Dundas and his cousin William
Grenville. When the writ was moved for a new election for Appleby on
Pitt's taking office, it was received with shouts of laughter; no pity
or favour was extended to the new minister; Dundas could hardly get a
hearing on ministerial business, motions of great importance were
pressed on even though Pitt had not yet taken his seat, and so certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1133" id="Page_1133">[1133]</a></span>
did Fox feel of restoration to office, that he wrote to a friend in Dublin
<span class="sidenote">Factious violence of the Opposition. 1784.</span>
that he would not dismiss one member of his household till after the
12th of January. On that day Pitt was to make his appearance as Prime
Minister. An address had been delivered to the King praying against
either an adjournment or dissolution, for this was the step which Fox's
party chiefly feared. On a favourable reply to this address, short
Christmas holidays had been allowed, and the House had to meet again
on the 12th. In those few days Pitt had got ready an India Bill, but
before he was allowed to produce it Fox had succeeded in carrying no
less than five motions against the Government, one of them pointing to
"unconstitutional abuse of his Majesty's sacred name." In spite of this
Pitt produced his Bill, which was similar in character to the Bill he
afterwards carried; it was lost by a majority of only twenty-one, which
on its second reading was still further diminished to eight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Firmness and sagacity of Pitt.</div>

<p>Things began to look a little more encouraging for the minister. He
determined with great wisdom to give the Opposition
rope, and urged them to constant violence by an obstinate
refusal to say whether he meant to dissolve or not. The language
of the Opposition had been so violent that the reaction was becoming
strongly marked in the country. "It was a contest," said Dr.
Johnson, "whether the nation should be ruled by the sceptre of
George III. or by the tongue of Fox." All attempts at mediation
failed, although many independent members attempted to effect it.
Fox's hope was, that if Pitt continued to avoid dissolution the 25th
of March would arrive without a new Parliament. On that day the
Mutiny Bill expired, and he hoped by refusing to renew it to compel
his rival to resign. But the tide had now fairly begun to turn;
Pitt's bravery was exciting the sympathy of the people, while the
unmeasured virulence of Fox and his party was constantly damaging
them. Pitt, too, had won great admiration by refusing for himself,
although his private means amounted to scarcely £300 a year, a rich
sinecure called the Clerkship of the Pells. This, with a somewhat
ironical pride, he had given to Colonel Barré in exchange for the
pension which the Rockingham ministry had so scandalously given
him. The threats that supplies should be stopped seemed to many
moderate people factious and improper, and numerous addresses
poured in from the Corporation of London and other towns. On
the 8th of March Fox played what may be called his last card; he
brought in a paper under the threatening title of "Representation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1134" id="Page_1134">[1134]</a></span>
the King;" after many hours of debate it was passed by a majority
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYFOUR_PITTS_VICTORY_OVER_OPPOSITION" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYFOUR_PITTS_VICTORY_OVER_OPPOSITION"></a>Pitt's victory.</span> of one only. It was plain
that the victory of Pitt was secure and that the Opposition had ruined
themselves. Accordingly, when on the next day the Mutiny Bill came on
there was no opposition, and having by firmness and moderation fairly
weathered the storm, Pitt on the 25th recommended the King to dissolve
the <span class="sidenote">Dissolution of Parliament and defeat of Whigs.
1784.</span> Parliament. The elections made it evident that the feeling
of the nation was entirely with Pitt; no less than 160 of Fox's friends
lost their seats&mdash;"Fox's martyrs" they were jocosely called. Several
great contests took place, the most notorious of which was that for
Yorkshire, where Wilberforce was brought in triumphantly in opposition
to the great territorial houses, and that for Westminster, where Fox
himself stood against Lord Hood and his old colleague Wray, who had
become a ministerialist. The poll was kept open forty days, amid scenes
of indescribable excitement. For twenty-three days Fox was at the bottom
of the poll, but at length the strenuous canvassing of his friends,
added to the charms of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, and other lady
politicians, succeeded in placing him second on the list. As more votes
however were registered than there were voters, obviously some fraud
had been committed, and a scrutiny was granted. Meanwhile, as the Whigs
held illegally, no return was made, Westminster was unrepresented, and
room had to be made for Fox in the close borough of Kirkwall. It was not
till the following session that Pitt, who, with some want of liberality,
upheld the conduct of the High Bailiff in refusing the return, was
defeated in the House on the subject. The representatives took their
seats, and Fox got £2000 damages from the Bailiff.</p>

<p>The great party struggle of the last year, which had terminated in
the utter discomfiture of the Whigs and the establishment of the
new Tory party under Pitt, had not left much time for the real
<span class="sidenote">Pressing measures.</span> requirements of the
State. India, Ireland, the finances, parliamentary reform, were all
matters which pressed for immediate attention. Firm in his parliamentary
majority and in the support of the King, Pitt proceeded to handle them.
The <span class="sidenote">Pitt's Budget.</span> finances were naturally
in a bad condition at the close of an unsuccessful war. The funds were
standing only at 56 or 57, the unfunded debt was upwards of £12,000,000,
and there was a considerable deficiency in the Civil List. One of the
principal sources of the revenue was destroyed by systematic smuggling
of tea. Men of otherwise respectable character and considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1135" id="Page_1135">[1135]</a></span>
capital were embarked in this trade. Large vessels brought
their tea, and lay off at some distance, distributing their cargoes to
small vessels, which landed them here and there on the coast.
Regular receiving-houses were established and lines of carriers which
brought the tea to the towns. It was estimated that the smuggled
tea was at least as much as that which paid duty. Pitt lowered the
duty both for this article and for spirits, the other great smuggled
commodity, so as to withdraw the temptation from the smugglers.
The deficit was made up by a house and window tax; this is known
as the Commutation Tax. An Act called the Hovering Act was also
passed, which extended the limits of the authority of the revenue
officers to four leagues from the coast. Half the unfunded debt Pitt
funded, and made up the deficit, which he considered a little below
a million, by taxes on various commodities. These arrangements
though they show no great novelty, were much applauded at the
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's India Bill. 1784.</div>

<p>Having thus cleared the way for general legislation, Pitt proceeded to
bring in his India Bill. It was very like the one which had been defeated
the preceding year, and was probably chiefly the work of Dundas. The
fate of Fox's Bills had shown the strength of the India House, while the
necessity for some Government control was acknowledged by all parties.
The present measure was therefore one of compromise. A new ministerial
department was established which should exercise the whole political
control of the Company; this was to be called the Board of Control. By
it was laid the foundation of that system of double government which
continued in force till 1858. All business was to be carried on in the
name of the Company, which retained the whole patronage except the
appointment of the commander-in-chief, and other higher functionaries,
whose appointment was subject to the veto of the Crown; but the Board of
Control absolutely dictated the political conduct of the Government. Thus
the chartered rights of the Company were left untouched; the balance of
influence was not upset by a sudden change of patronage; the Board of
Control, being ministerial, passed in or out of office with the ministry,
but India was secured against mercantile views of policy by its political
management being withdrawn from the hands of a merchant company. It was
certainly a less complete Bill than its predecessor, it could not be a
permanent arrangement, but tided over the present difficulty, and was
carried without serious opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1136" id="Page_1136">[1136]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of Ireland.</div>

<p>Much more difficult was the settlement of Ireland. The rational and
patriotic demands of the volunteers, which had led to the legislation
of 1780 and 1782, had been satisfied by those measures, but had been
followed, as is always the case in Ireland, by agitation of a more
revolutionary character. The leadership of the movement had passed
from Grattan to Flood, rather a demagogue than a statesman, and the
volunteers, a national and patriotic body, gradually dwindled to nothing,
and in their place arose a clamorous and revolutionary democracy. The
cry put forward was for parliamentary reform, the urgent necessity for
which was indeed obvious. In a Parliament of 300, 116 seats were held
by nominees of no more than 25 proprietors. The Government commanded
186 votes, pledged to them in exchange for the possession or hope of
offices or pensions, 12 members were regarded as honest supporters of the
Government, the regular Opposition was about 82, 30 Whig nominees, and
52 members of the popular party. To this Parliament Flood introduced a
sweeping measure of reform. A scene <span class="sidenote">Flood's
democratic measure of reform.</span> of wild uproar was the consequence,
the Bill was thrown out by a large majority; no better success attended
its reintroduction in a more moderate form. The mob rose in wild
disorder, and acts of ferocious cruelty were perpetrated. The leader of
this movement outside Parliament was Napper Tandy, an ironmonger, who
did not scruple to intrigue with the Court of France. Some of the lower
priests were also engaged on the popular side, but as Flood refused the
franchise to the Catholics in his proposition, the main body held aloof
from the movement. This state of disorder Pitt intended to improve by
reforming the Parliament in a more practical and moderate manner and by
commercial arrangements. All attempts at parliamentary reform had however
to be abandoned; but the minister felt that before any vigorous measures
could be adopted it was necessary to grant justice to the people. He
determined therefore to complete the work of 1780, and to establish real
commercial equality between England and Ireland. At the same
<span class="sidenote">Pitt's policy for Ireland.</span> time he
strongly held that equality of privilege implied equality of burdens.
In accordance with this view eleven resolutions were brought into the
Irish Parliament and accepted without much opposition. By these the
restrictions of trade, which had already been removed as far as regarded
Europe and the West Indies, would be removed in like manner with regard
to the rest of the world; and with regard to imports, England and Ireland
would become one nation, so that goods landed in Ireland could be
re-imported into England without further duty. In exchange for this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1137" id="Page_1137">[1137]</a></span>
all the hereditary income of the Crown, which was derived chiefly from
customs, beyond the sum of £656,000 was to be applied to the support
of the Imperial navy. Thus the money paid would bear a direct proportion
to the advantages gained by Ireland by the extension of her
trade. Pitt, sure of the economical soundness of the principles on
which this Bill was based, only courted full discussion. He underrated
<span class="sidenote">Selfish commercial opposition.</span> the
selfishness of the commercial interest. On the resolutions being
introduced to the English Parliament, the strongest opposition was
raised by merchants and manufacturers, afraid of a fresh competitor; and
Fox and Burke, the first of whom was confessedly ignorant of the laws
of political economy, turned the opposition to their party purposes.
The Bill had to be altered considerably, restrictions with regard to
the Asiatic trade had to be continued, thus seriously diminishing the
advantage granted to Ireland, while Pitt laid himself open to the charge
of encroaching upon the newly-earned independence of that country by
trying to establish the commercial superiority of England, since all
this commercial legislation was to emanate from the English Parliament.
The Whigs took immediate advantage of this error, and, unable to stop
the Bill in the English Parliament, used all their eloquence to inflame
the patriotic feeling of the Irish. The Bill in its changed form was
therefore rejected in Dublin (August), and Pitt began to
<span class="sidenote">Pitt recognizes the necessity for a union.</span>
feel the necessity for that great measure which he completed eighteen
years afterwards. If either true parliamentary reform was to be brought
about or commercial equality to be established, not only legislative
equality, but legislative union, it was plain, would be necessary.</p>

<p>This was not the only defeat which the ministry suffered. It
was no more successful in its efforts at parliamentary reform in
England. In fact, the interest felt in the question had begun to flag;
it had been raised to its utmost by the separation between the
representatives of the people and the people they represented, which
had been so obvious during the administration of Grenville, and by
<span class="sidenote">Failure of Pitt's Reform Bill.</span> the long
and disastrous triumph of royal influence under Lord North. But Pitt's
success rested entirely upon the will of the constituencies after the
late dissolution, and the people were on the whole satisfied with
their representation. But with Pitt, as with his father, the reform of
Parliament had always been a favourite object; he now produced a Bill
by which he hoped to win all parties to his side, but its very timidity
weakened its popularity. He proposed to disfranchise thirty-six rotten boroughs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1138" id="Page_1138">[1138]</a></span>
and to give the seventy-two seats thus gained to the counties and
to London and Westminster. Thus far he was true to his old plan, but
afraid of the opposition of borough proprietors, he consented to
recognize as a part of the Constitution their rights of proprietorship,
and designed to set apart a fund of £1,000,000 to satisfy the claims of
the possessors of the boroughs which he wished to destroy. Such as it was
the Bill was rejected by a majority of seventy, and Pitt regarded the
question henceforward as settled against him. It is to be observed that
all these measures, whether successful or not, were such as we should now
speak of as Liberal measures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His financial success.</div>

<p>The success of the Government in its financial schemes, on the
other hand, was marked, although the arrangement
which at this time excited most admiration has since
been recognized as based upon an absurd fallacy. Alarmed at
the great increase of the National Debt, and inspired with an honest
wish to reduce it, Pitt produced his plan for a sinking fund. His
taxes had been so successful, and the financial recovery of the nation
at peace and under a firm Government had been such, that he found
himself possessed of a surplus closely bordering on a million, and
suggested that this million should annually be set aside and vested
in commissioners to accumulate at compound interest. It was to be
beyond the control of Government, and this fund with its accumulations
was to be applied, as circumstances permitted, to the reduction
of the debt. The principle is obviously sound as far as it goes, that
is to say, what a nation saves it can clearly apply to the purpose
of reducing its liabilities, but there the matter ends; there is and
can be no peculiar and mysterious power in a sinking fund. But
this was not seen by Pitt, or by those who approved of his plan,
and when times of difficulty arose, the million went on year by year
being religiously set aside, although not only one million, but many
millions were yearly borrowed for the purpose of covering the current
expenses of the year. Interest, and often much higher interest, was
thus paid out on the one side in order that a less interest might be
gained on the other. It was not till the year 1828 that this fallacy
was finally exposed by Lord Grenville, who, strangely enough, had
been the chairman of the committee who first recommended its adoption.
It had however been virtually abandoned in 1807. Although
<span class="sidenote">Commercial treaty with France. Sept. 1786.</span>
he fell into this error, Pitt's financial views were generally
broad; thus about this time he entered into a commercial
treaty with France, by which, with some very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1139" id="Page_1139">[1139]</a></span>
exceptions, prohibitory duties between the countries were repealed, a
moderate tariff was established, and the famous Methuen Treaty with
Portugal, which had almost excluded French wines, and changed the habits
of the English nation, giving them a taste for the hot wines of the
Peninsula, was abrogated. He also greatly simplified the custom duties,
supplying their place in some instances with excise or customs levied
inland, a most beneficial measure, but formerly so unpopular that it had
almost proved fatal to the ministry of Walpole, the only great financial
minister England had had during the century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYFIVE_CHARGES_AGAINST_WARREN_HASTINGS" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYFIVE_CHARGES_AGAINST_WARREN_HASTINGS"></a>Charges against Warren Hastings.</div>

<p>These measures, important as they were, excited little attention in
comparison with the threatened impeachment of Warren Hastings. Though, as
we have seen, censured, and almost recalled in 1781, the Governor-General
had latterly retained his post unmolested, and came home in June 1785
on the natural expiration of his office. At home he was well received,
but he had two vindictive enemies in the House of Commons, one, Edmund
Burke, whose imagination had always been strongly drawn towards the
majestic history of Hindostan, and whose hatred of oppression had been
strongly fired by the accounts which had lately been received from
India; the other, Philip Francis, the rancorous and defeated rival of
the late Governor-General; and Hastings had scarcely arrived in England
before Burke gave notice that he should call attention to his conduct.
The feeling in England that Hastings had on the whole done a great work
was so strong, that, although the ministry had shown him many marks of
favour, it is possible that even Burke might have left him untouched had
not his injudicious and wearisome agent, Major Scott, challenged inquiry.
Burke accepted the challenge, and in April produced specific charges
against him, based principally on his war with the Rohillas and on his
conduct to Cheyte Singh and the Begums of Oude. Hastings, who was always
unable to understand the feeling of the House of Commons, insisted on
being personally heard at the bar, and wearied the House by reading a
written document of enormous length, which occupied a day and a half in
reading. On the first charge, however, with regard to the Rohilla war, a
considerable majority was in his favour; it will be remembered that this
belonged to the first period of his administration, and it was upon this
that he had been already censured; but as Dundas, the original mover of
the vote of censure, urged, with much show of right, the fault was an old
one, and had been condoned by the subsequent appointment of Hastings
as Governor-General.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1140" id="Page_1140">[1140]</a></span>
Hastings and his friends believed that his cause had gained the support
of Government and was now secure. Great was their dismay when,
upon the second charge with regard to Cheyte Singh, which
<span class="sidenote">Pitt supports them.</span> was brought forward
by Fox, Pitt rose and declared, that although he regarded Cheyte Singh
as the vassal of the Bengal Empire, and liable to be called on for
assistance, he could not but regard the infliction of a fine of £500,000
for the non-payment of £50,000 as ridiculously and shamefully exorbitant.
On these grounds, he said, he should support the charge, all his friends
voted with him, and Fox's resolution passed by a majority of forty. This
entirely changed the aspect of affairs, but the lateness of the season
(June 1786) rendered it necessary that the completion of the charges
should be postponed till the next year. In the February of that year
Sheridan, in a speech occupying five hours and forty minutes, produced
the charge with regard to the Begums of Oude. So striking was this piece
of oratory that it was deemed necessary to adjourn the House lest the
excitement produced by it should prevent cool judgment of the matter.
Again, and with the same result as <span class="sidenote">Consequent
impeachment. 1787.</span> before, Pitt both spoke and voted in favour
of the charge. On these and other charges Burke, in May, founded a
resolution of impeachment, and proceeding to the Upper House, impeached
the late Governor-General, who was taken into custody and admitted to
bail. The trial did not actually begin till February 1788.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYSEVEN_CONDUCT_OF_THE_PRINCE" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYSEVEN_CONDUCT_OF_THE_PRINCE"></a>Conduct of the Prince of Wales.</div>

<p>Another question which now arose, and which was in the next year to be
of the greatest importance, was the conduct and character of the Prince
of Wales. True to the traditions and customs of his family, he had allied
himself to the enemies of his father, and not only in his political but
in his domestic life had much outraged the King's feelings. From the
respectable and somewhat repellant family life of the Court, the princes,
one and all, took refuge in a disorderly and licentious life. The stern
propriety of the father, and the somewhat unlovely rigidity of the
mother, undid the work which their thoroughly domestic character should
have done. The Prince of Wales had everything in his favour upon his
entrance into life. Good-looking, of pleasant manners, of considerable
ability, and views at all events nominally liberal, there was nothing
to prevent his great popularity. Unfortunately the profligacy of his
life, which the world might have pardoned, was the mark of a thoroughly
depraved character, which led him into breaches of honour. This fault
became very obvious in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1141" id="Page_1141">[1141]</a></span>
1787. For some time he had been clamouring for the payment of his debts,
and on the King's refusal to discharge them, he had in a huff reduced his
establishment and pretended to live like a private gentleman. Meanwhile
he had been entangled in an awkward love affair. Mrs. Fitzherbert, a
Roman Catholic lady, had attracted his attention, and refused to listen
to his advances unless he would marry her. This he did. Now, by the Act
of Settlement, marriage with a Roman Catholic invalidated all claims
to the throne, but by a second statute, the Royal Marriage Act, any
marriage contracted without the royal consent was null. By pleading the
second, the Prince could therefore avoid the action of the first, but
by so doing was virtually taking away the character of his wife, and
obviously evading the law. With this slur upon his character, he came to
the Parliament for the payment of his debts. The charge against him was
raised by Rolle, the member for Devonshire, and Fox, completely duped by
his royal friend, was induced to give the fact a flat denial. The Prince
completed his treachery by afterwards disavowing his instructions to Fox.
Such conduct naturally produced a temporary coolness between them. After
so strong a denial, however, it was impossible to refuse the Prince's
demand, and his debts were paid, to the amount of £160,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYEIGHT_TRIAL_OF_WARREN_HASTINGS" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYEIGHT_TRIAL_OF_WARREN_HASTINGS"></a>Trial of Warren Hastings. Feb. 1788.</div>

<p>The work of the last year was completed by the commencement, in
February, of the trial of Warren Hastings. The trial took place in
Westminster Hall, the Peers sitting as judges, presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, and the accusations being supported by the managers appointed
by the House of Commons, assisted by the most eloquent men in England,
among their number, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and Wyndham. The very talents
of the accusers, together with the exaggerated and unlawyer-like style
of Burke, tended to the safety of the accused. The trial became a mere
exhibition of rhetoric; people crowded to hear the speeches, but withdrew
as the legal points were argued, or the evidence produced, while Burke's
language was so intemperate that the Lord Chancellor and even the House
of Commons censured him. At the same time, in 1789, the gradual change
of popular feeling was shown in the trial of Stockdale for libel against
the promoters of Hastings' trial. He was prosecuted at the demand of
the Commons, at the Government expense, but was acquitted. Three years
afterwards Burke himself renounced sixteen of his charges, and all
interest in the end of the trial gradually disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First motion for abolition of the slave trade. May
9, 1788.</div>

<p>The year was marked not only by the completion of old questions,
but by the appearance of a new one. This was the question of the slave
trade. The horrors of this trade had for many years been before the
public, and the opposition to slavery had so far been organized, that
it had been determined to assault&mdash;what it was believed might be
overthrown without much difficulty&mdash;the actual trade in slaves, and
leave the abolition of slavery itself for a future occasion. The horrors
of the trade could scarcely be exaggerated. Ships built for the purpose
were employed, in which the allowance of room for a slave was five feet
and a half in length by one foot four inches in breadth. The extreme
height between decks was five feet eight inches, but this was occupied
by shelves, upon which the slaves were packed. Sixteen hours a day they
remained below, chained to the deck, fed upon a pint of water and two
feeds of horse beans. Such conditions of life, for weeks together, in the
tropics, not being conducive to health, they were brought up and forced
to jump upon the deck, under the influence of the whip, for the sake of
exercise. If any difficulty arose, they were tossed overboard without
scruple, and English law courts held underwriters answerable for such
loss, as arising from the natural perils of the sea. No charge of murder,
or even manslaughter, was ever dreamt of. These facts were elicited by a
Parliamentary Committee, presided over by Whitbread, from witnesses who
had previously described the excellent arrangements of the ships and the
cheerful merry dancing of the slaves upon the voyage. Before any action
could be taken upon these revelations, an event occurred which for a
moment threatened the stability of the ministry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King's illness. Nov. 1788.</div>

<p>In November, after some months of illness, the King was declared
incapable of carrying on the business of the country. His illness
assumed the form of insanity, and even if he should survive, as was
thought doubtful, it seemed plain that a regency would be inevitable.
The King's physicians, following the ignorant practice with regard to
lunatics which obtained at that time, prescribed the strictest and most
galling constraints, separated the King from his wife, refused him the
use of knife and fork and razor, and intrusted him to coarse and cruel
servants. Having by this means intensified the symptoms, they proceeded
to pronounce them incurable. Fortunately for the King, Lady Harcourt was
bold enough to recommend Dr. Willis, who, originally a clergyman, had for
nearly thirty years been managing a private asylum for lunatics, where he
had met with much success. On being summoned, he at
once declared he could cure the King, and the Queen and Pitt placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1143" id="Page_1143">[1143]</a></span>
him in his hands with implicit confidence. Thus when, after some
prorogation, Parliament assembled in December, a committee which
had examined the medical evidence expressed a hope of the King's
recovery. Armed with this report, Pitt moved for an examination
of precedents before arranging the regency, while Fox, forgetful of
the Prince's late duplicity, and clutching eagerly at the power which
seemed just within his grasp, asserted that precedents were useless, as
"the heir-apparent had an inherent right to assume the reins of government."
As Pitt immediately pointed out, this was to rob the Parliament
of all power in the matter, although it had twice been regarded
as competent to change the succession to the throne. The vehemence
of the Whig party in fact overreached itself, and enabled Pitt, who
firmly believed that he was on the point of being driven from office,
with a somewhat ostentatious show of carelessness as to the favour of
<span class="sidenote">The Regency Bill.</span> the future King or
Regent, to produce a Bill nominating indeed the heir-apparent as the
Regent, but under strict limitations. The principle he laid down was
that, as the King would in all probability recover, he should, on
resuming his functions, find things as little altered as possible. He
therefore refused to the Prince of Wales the right of making Peers, or
granting places, in reversion or for any term except during his Majesty's
pleasure, while the care of the King's person and household was left in
the Queen's power. Nothing, probably, but the feeling that the Prince
was thoroughly immoral could have allowed Pitt to produce so stringent
a Bill. It was not indeed passed, for the necessity of passing it was
prevented by the recovery of the King. This had been the work of Dr.
Willis, who, by mingled kindness and firmness, the removal of all the
ridiculous restraints the King's doctors had laid upon him, had succeeded
in restoring his self-respect and bringing him back almost to his usual
state of sanity, although for some weeks longer he persistently believed,
while showing the tenderest affection for the Queen, that he was deeply
in love with one of the ladies of the Court.</p>

<p>Pitt's faithful adherence to George during his illness, and the
firmness with which he had insisted on keeping things unchanged,
though at the risk of total loss of favour for himself, bound the King
<span class="sidenote">Pre-eminence of Pitt.</span> to him more
closely than ever, and for many years to come his position was quite
unassailable. Up to this time Pitt's policy had been enlarged and liberal
in all directions. He had contrived to realize his father's plan, and
resting on the authority of the Crown, but independent as a minister, had
destroyed the monopoly of power so long held by the great Whig factions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1144" id="Page_1144">[1144]</a></span>
This he had done without subserviency and without deserting the Liberal
principles in which he had been trained, but he could not but feel that
he rested primarily on the royal support, and insensibly his policy had
become the royal policy, and he was pledged to support the influence of
the Crown. This gradual and almost unobserved change was called into
active exhibition by the events which were happening in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the French Revolution in England.</div>

<p><span class="first drop">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> year which followed the King's recovery saw the opening of
the Great Revolution in France. This event produced ultimately
an entire alteration in the character of Pitt's
policy, and a split between Burke and Fox which
virtually annihilated for the time the Whig party, and
rendered Pitt absolutely pre-eminent; but it was not till more than
a year had passed that its full effect was felt in England, although
from its first outbreak it had a tendency to exaggerate party
differences, and brought into more striking contrast the principles of
those who, like Pitt, desired the maintenance of a strong royal
power, of those who, like Burke, looked no further than the establishment
of an aristocratic constitution, and of those who saw with
pleasure every advance towards the realization of those dreams of
class equality which for more than a century had been stirring in
Europe. When at length the influence of the Revolution became
irresistible, England was in a position abroad to take a leading part
in the European opposition to its principles, and at home social
changes had occurred which rendered such a course of policy inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political development of England.</div>

<p>Although Pitt was probably aware that he was not a great war
minister, or fitted, as his father had been, to inspire the nation with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1146" id="Page_1146">[1146]</a></span>
enthusiasm in the midst of danger, he by no means forgot to uphold
the dignity of his country; and his management of
foreign affairs certainly raised England from the depression
into which she had sunk after the loss of her colonies,
and the disadvantageous peace contracted with France and Spain at
the close of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_AFFAIR_OF_NOOTKA_SOUND" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_AFFAIR_OF_NOOTKA_SOUND"></a>Affair of Nootka Sound.</div>

<p>One of the first instances in which this reviving spirit was shown was
the affair of Nootka Sound. Spain, raising the arrogant claim that to
her belonged the whole west coast of America, seized an English ship in
Nootka Sound, in Vancouver's Island, and destroyed our settlement there.
Upon this, Pitt, drawing closer his alliance with Prussia and Holland,
and going so far as to increase largely the number of men in the navy,
managed to exact from Spain a withdrawal of this claim and a restoration
of English property, granting in exchange an assurance that illicit trade
with the Spanish colonies should be checked.</p>

<p>But far more important than this single exhibition of determination
against a country so decayed as Spain was the successful
policy which Pitt pursued with regard to the general policy of
Eastern Europe. The first opening which occurred was in Holland.
<span class="sidenote">Forms an alliance with Holland.</span>
In that country there existed, as usual, a constant strife
between two great parties, the party of the Republicans
and the party of the Prince of Orange. Of old the
republican party had meant the party of the aristocratic and wealthy
merchants of the country. The party of the Prince of Orange had
almost without exception been favoured by the bulk of the people.
But ideas had been rapidly growing; republicanism had assumed
a somewhat different meaning. The war between ruler and
aristocracy had been changing to a rivalry between the ruler,
supported by the lovers of order and fixed authority, and those
whose views were of a more democratic stamp. But the democrats
of Holland still regarded themselves as the legitimate descendants of
the republican party, and inherited the foreign policy of their
predecessors. Like them, they sought the support and assistance of
France, while the Stadtholder and his friends regarded England as
their chief support. The agitation in Holland had been so vigorous
that the Prince of Orange had been forced to withdraw to Nimeguen,
leaving the Government in the hands of his rivals. In this there
was a manifest danger to England. If the democrats remained in
possession of the country Holland would become little else than
a dependency of France, instead of what it had so often been, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1147" id="Page_1147">[1147]</a></span>
firm ally of England. At the present moment France was more particularly
ready to give it support. Vergennes, the French minister, was anxious
to retain some sort of prestige for the Government, which was rapidly
sinking in power and credit under the reckless and wasteful management
of Calonne. No better opportunity could have been afforded him than the
chance of undertaking a successful piece of diplomacy, or of war, in
behalf of a democratic party, whose opinions had much in harmony with
the rapidly increasing revolutionary feeling of France. Moreover, the
commercial world of France was full of hostility to the late treaty with
England; and as Vergennes had contracted that treaty, he hoped to wipe
out some of his unpopularity by raising difficulties as to the completion
of that part of it which touched upon the French trade with India.
There the Dutch and French interests both led them to oppose England as
far as possible, and a war would almost certainly have commenced had
not Vergennes died. At the same time Calonne gave place to Lomenie de
Brienne, and it was uncertain what course he would pursue. The question
was brought to a crisis by a curious act of ill-judged violence on the
part of the democrats, who seized upon the person of the Princess of
Orange while she was visiting the Hague, it was believed for the purpose
of attempting some reconciliation. As the Princess of Orange was the
sister of the King of Prussia, he was able to use the attack upon so
near a relative as a fair pretext for interfering on behalf of royalty.
He marched 20,000 men to the frontiers under the Duke of Brunswick,
thus affording Pitt the opportunity he desired of reconnecting England
with European allies. He made common cause with Prussia, promising the
assistance of the English fleet, and sent to demand from France an
explanation of the 15,000 men they had assembled at Givet. The French
refused an explanation, promised assistance to the States-General,
and proceeded to send their troops into the country. The united arms
of Prussia and England were entirely successful, the Stadtholder was
restored to power with even less restriction than usual. The friendship
thus begun ripened into alliance; and Holland, now entirely in the
English interest, joining with England and Prussia, a sort of triple
alliance was entered into for securing the peace of Europe, and to
support the principle of the balance of power, in which Pitt was a firm
believer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His efforts to oppose Russia.</div>

<p>The rising influence of Russia was the great object of Pitt's dread.
The progress of that country was very threatening; its
vast bulk and unknown resources, and the success which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1148" id="Page_1148">[1148]</a></span>
had hitherto attended its progress since the time of Peter the Great, had
rendered it a very formidable element in the European system. Chatham had
indeed regarded its growth as advantageous to Europe, the counterpoise
at once to the power of the French and of the Prussians. His son took
a different view, justified by the evident attempts of the Empress to
increase her power at the expense of Turkey, and thus to secure the Black
Sea, if not the Mediterranean, and by the ever-increasing influence which
she exercised over both Prussia and Austria. Even the great Frederick
had found himself obliged to court his formidable neighbour; again and
again his brother, Prince Henry, had visited St. Petersburg; while Joseph
II. of Austria was entirely led away by the Czarina's greatness. Already
the greater part of Poland had been absorbed by that Empire; there now
remained two powers at either extremity of the great mass of Russia which
might easily have suffered a similar treatment. These were Turkey and
Sweden. In the year 1787 the aggression for which Europe was waiting took
place. The Emperor Joseph had a meeting with the Czarina, and travelled
with her in her carriage as she went to visit the Crimea. He was there
thoroughly dazzled by the greatness of the scheme which she unfolded to
him. Turkey and Greece were to be conquered, and the old Empire of the
East to be re-established. In exchange, it was hinted that something
like a Western Empire should be constituted, and Italy, as of old, be
placed under the Austrian sway. But the success of the Czarina and the
Emperor was hampered by the sudden and vigorous assaults upon Russia from
the side of Sweden under its King Gustavus III. This attack in its turn
threatened to be neutralized by the intervention of the Danes, who were
connected in friendship with the Czarina. Such, then, was the position
of affairs which Pitt had to consider, in reference always to what he
believed of vital importance, the European balance,&mdash;on the one
side, Austria, Russia, and Denmark; on the other, Turkey and Sweden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alliance with Prussia, Holland and Sweden.</div>

<p>There were three countries against which Pitt could put in practice
what appears to have been his fixed plan of European action; desirous of
peace, and thinking few questions of sufficient importance to authorise
him in plunging Europe into war, he hoped, by a show of superior power on
the part of himself and his allies, to uphold the dignity of England and
the existing balance of power. He began with the weakest. He drew closer
his friendship with Prussia, and his threats in union with
that power were sufficient to detach Denmark from its allies, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1149" id="Page_1149">[1149]</a></span>
to rid Sweden of the enemy in its rear, and to allow it to carry on its
aggressive movements, which seemed so successful as a diversion in favour
of Turkey. An alliance with Holland, Sweden, and Prussia secured the
maintenance of peace on the part of Denmark. He then turned to Austria;
for the danger from the joint attack on Turkey had become really imminent
when the strong fortress of Oczakow had fallen into the hands of the
Czarina's favourite Potemkin. The opportunity was favourable. Joseph II.
had died, in 1790, just as all his plans, whether of aggressive ambition
on the side of Turkey or of domestic reform in Flanders, had seemed to
terminate in failure; while in Flanders a spirit of insurrection, too
powerful for him to suppress, had been excited by certain reforms which
he there introduced. Indeed, domestic dangers had threatened him on all
sides. His successor, Leopold, was desirous of securing the friendship
of French and German powers to aid him in his election to the Imperial
Crown; and under threat of an immediate invasion
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETY_THE_CONVENTION_OF_REICHENBACH" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETY_THE_CONVENTION_OF_REICHENBACH"></a>Procures the Convention of Reichenbach.</span>
from Prussia, which Pitt had instigated, and impressed with the rising
danger to all monarchies from the events which were occurring in France,
he consented to conclude in August 1790 the Convention of Reichenbach
and to withdraw from the Turkish war. Twice, then, Pitt's policy of
intervention, combined with threats, but without actual warfare, had been
thoroughly successful. The position of England began to stand higher
abroad, and the country had again been brought into close connection with
its old German allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fails in his intervention with Russia.</div>

<p>His third intervention was less successful. The Czarina, left to
herself both by friends and enemies, persisted in her course, and the
fall of Ismail in December was marked by astonishing barbarities. Pitt
thought to act upon the Russian Empress as, in conjunction with Prussia,
he had acted upon Austria. He demanded that a peace should be made upon
the <i>status quo</i> before the war, and threatened to support his demand by
arms. An increase of the fleet was indeed ordered, but Pitt was mistaken
both in the temper of the English and in that of the Russian Empress.
The isolated threat of one country standing without allies did not seem
to her very terrible; to the people of England the danger of a Russian
aggression was of little importance. Pitt found it necessary to change
his policy and withdraw his threat, and was content to allow Russia to
conclude a peace by which she obtained the territory between the Bug and
the Dniester and the fortress of Oczakow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1150" id="Page_1150">[1150]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Industrial development of England.</div>

<p>But it was not only in its political position that England had
developed with extraordinary rapidity after the American War. The
whole condition of those industrial arts which give work to the lower
orders was changed, and an enormous impulse given to the employment of
industry. In spite of the constant complaints of those who were bent upon
asserting the decline of the nation, the population had been gradually
increasing ever since the Revolution of 1688; the rate of increase in the
thirty years preceding 1780 was about 400,000 a year. This increase of
population had already begun to call fresh land into cultivation; between
1760 and 1770 no less than a thousand enclosure Bills were passed. The
improved processes of husbandry did even more than the mere extent of
cultivable area to increase the productive power of agriculture. But this
agricultural production could never have increased at the rate it did had
it not been that the proportion between consumers and producers of food
was rapidly being altered; for it was this period which changed England
from an agricultural to a manufacturing country, and placed the weight
of population, which had hitherto been greater in the South, entirely in
the North. By successive steps all the great improvements in spinning
and weaving were introduced; the discovery that iron could be worked as
well with pit coal as with charcoal gave an immense impetus to the second
great branch of industry; and the improvement in the steam engine, which
enabled machinery to be worked irrespective of local peculiarities,
spread the manufactures, which had hitherto nestled among the hills for
the sake of obtaining water-power, into all parts of the coal-producing
districts. This burst of industry of necessity produced great economic
changes. The employment of labour in manufactories tended to increase
the population rapidly. The increase of numbers, the growth of wealth
among the manufacturers, called into activity more skill in agriculture,
and demanded the occupation of more land. Land to which recourse is had
under this pressure is naturally the worse land; it therefore requires
more labour to produce its crop, and the most laboriously produced crop
sets the value of the whole; the prices of the necessaries of life began
rapidly to rise. Though the use of machinery made many things cheaper,
and improved methods of husbandry prevented prices from rising as they
would otherwise have done, as a general rule, while the price of luxuries
decreased, the price of necessaries rose. Wages did not rise with a
proportionate rapidity, and it was still a question whether, if
the French war had not intervened, the relation between food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1151" id="Page_1151">[1151]</a></span>
consumption, between prices and wages, would have been satisfactorily
arranged. It was however evident that all these improvements, while they
created great wealth for the middle and mercantile classes, by no means
rendered the position of the mechanic and artisan easier, while, at the
same time, higher and more intelligent employment, and the more sedentary
life led by the mechanic, were well suited to foster habits of thought,
and to make the half-educated man a shallow reasoner, ready to accept
crude ideas as to the measures best fitted to produce improvement in the
social position of himself and his class; and such ideas, emanating from
France, had been for some time widely spread among the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Active condition of England abroad and at
home.</div>

<p>Thus, while England had gradually resumed her commanding position
abroad, and was ready with allies to join in any external movement, and
while the growing wealth of the mercantile world was rendering it daily
more certain that any such movement would be in a conservative direction,
the people&mdash;increased in numbers and intelligence, but not bettered
in their general condition&mdash;were becoming ready to lend a willing
ear to any measures which promised to improve the political position of
their class. And it was just at this time that the French Revolution
broke out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION"></a>Causes of the French Revolution.</div>

<p>On the 5th of May 1789 the States-General of France was assembled
for the first time since the year 1614. The causes of this momentous
event, which produced nothing less than a complete change in the history
of the world, were of ancient growth; the explosion had been slowly
preparing ever since Louis XIV. had completed the mistaken policy of
centralization, and had been able to say that the King and the State were
one. The power and importance of the Crown had been secured at the cost
of the destruction or degradation of all the conservative elements of
society. The nobility, deprived of their local power, had been summoned
to the capital to swell the splendour of the Court; without duties they
still continued to enjoy privileges, while the administrative power was
practically centred in the hands of the royal intendants; they were
exempt from direct taxation, and known to their tenantry and dependants
only by the feudal dues which they exacted, and by certain remnants of
feudal services they could still claim. The judicial body, the "nobility
of the robe," held their position, not by merit or by legal knowledge,
but by purchase. The upper clergy were drawn to the Court like the
nobles, and lived in splendour, while the village curé had hardly the means of livelihood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1152" id="Page_1152">[1152]</a></span>
The people, oppressed by unjust taxation, excluded from all
hope of bettering their condition, saw themselves deserted by their
natural guardians and leaders, who seemed to enjoy wealth wrung
from their toil, and honours earned by no merit of their own, but
solely on the ground of birth. The misery of their position was
aggravated by the constant recurrence of famines, and they saw with
rage the corn trade so manipulated by men in the highest position
as to all appearance to increase the scarcity. But an oppressed
people will suffer long in silence unless the temper of the class
above them be such as to favour the expression of their discontent.
Such a temper had been called into existence among the thinking
middle classes by the growth of scepticism and materialistic philosophy.
Drawn originally from English sources, from the writings
of the philosophers of the English Revolution, this form of thought
had found its exponent in Voltaire, from the keen shafts of whose wit
no abuse and no institution was secure. Montesquieu had pushed
the same spirit of inquiry into political and constitutional questions,
and Rousseau, more sentimental and spiritual in his views, had
supplied a firmer but no less revolutionary basis to society than
was afforded by the purely negative teaching of Voltaire. The
literary power of these men make them the best known exponents
of the spirit of the time, but the spirit itself was prevalent everywhere.
Thus, while the institutions of the country were radically bad, they
were exposed to the fiercest and most destructive criticism, and ideas
of the possibility and rightfulness of a happier state of things were
suggested to the public mind. The conduct of the Court and
Government was not of a character to blunt the criticisms directed
against them; the finances were in a state of hopeless disorder. The
accession of Louis XVI. had for a moment raised hopes of a change
of system; Turgot, an honest and able man of reforming views, was
summoned to the ministry. But as his plan included of necessity
retrenchment on the part of the Court and the taxation of the privileged
classes, Court, nobles, and magistracy made common cause against
him, and he found their opposition too strong for him. The same
fate attended every effort at reform. Minister after minister was
called to office, content either to follow the old course, which was
inevitably leading to bankruptcy, or obliged to yield before the
selfish opposition of the privileged classes. In turn, Clugny, Necker,
and Calonne withdrew discomfited. At length, in 1787, the Cardinal
Lomenie de Brienne accepted the difficult post. Like his predecessors,
he soon found that there was no resource but the extension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1153" id="Page_1153">[1153]</a></span>
taxation. This brought him into collision with the Parlement, the chief
court of justice, whose members were drawn from among the privileged
class. They contrived for a while to give their opposition the appearance
of a popular movement against the power of the Crown; they even went
so far as to declare that the right of extending taxation resided in
the States-General alone. It was in vain that the King superseded the
Parlement, and produced a new and by no means injudicious constitution;
the mention of the States-General had seemed to open a new view to the
people; nothing short of them would now be accepted. The new constitution
fell hopelessly to the ground; the King found it necessary to recall
Necker, the only minister who had enjoyed any popular confidence, and his
triumphant return was speedily followed by the meeting of the States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assembly of the States-General. May 5, 1789.</div>

<p>The assembling of the States-General, which was by many regarded
with hope as the close of the difficulties of France, proved
but the beginning of troubles. The unprivileged classes
had at length obtained the means of expressing their
wants, and would be satisfied with nothing short of complete revolution.
Unfortunately, the King, a well-meaning man, with a real love
for his people, was of a slow intellect, and easily guided by those
around him. He fell into the hands of the princes and courtiers,
and was induced to make common cause with the privileged classes,
which were at first the real object of attack. When the Commons,
or Tiers Etat, declared themselves the real representation of the
nation, and changed the States-General into a National Assembly,
he attempted to check them by a royal sitting, only to find his
authority disregarded. The Commons assembled in the Tennis
Court at Versailles (June 20), swore to perfect the constitution,
and became the dominant power in the nation. An attempt to
check their further advance by force of arms, the collection of troops
around Paris, the removal of the popular minister Necker and the
appointment of the Marshal de Broglie to the command of the army,
drove Paris to insurrection. The thorough untrustworthiness of
the army was proved; the Bastille fell (July 14); the National
Guard sprang into existence; and a revolutionary Commune at the
Hôtel de Ville governed the capital. The power of the sword passed
into the hands of the people. Though the Assembly continued the
work of the constitution, though, on the 4th of August, the aristocracy,
in a moment of wild enthusiasm, surrendered all its old feudal
rights, the mistrust of the Parisians, aggravated by the famine and
the difficulty of subsistence, continued to increase. The Court imprudently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1154" id="Page_1154">[1154]</a></span>
gave colour to its mistrust, Lafayette, at the head of the
National Guard, desired to get the management of the Revolution
more entirely in his own hands. On the 6th of October a crowd of
National Guards and starving women marched to Versailles and
brought the King in triumph to Paris. He was followed by the
<span class="sidenote">The King brought to Paris. Oct. 6.</span>
National Assembly, which henceforward worked under
the eyes of the Parisian Commune and people. The
prestige of royalty disappeared, the King was in fact a
prisoner in his own capital; the power had passed even from the
National Assembly, and was centred in the people of Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excitement produced in England.</div>

<p>Such scenes, marked by acts of sanguinary vengeance on the part of
the people, and showing the absolute powerlessness of the old system of
Louis XIV., could not fail to excite the strongest interest in Europe.
Nowhere was this more the case than in England. To some it appeared that
our great enemy was perishing before our eyes of its own natural decay;
while from another point of view, to lovers of liberty, there was a whole
world of hope in the vigorous life exhibited by a people, downtrodden as
the French lower orders were believed to be; to another party the hurried
and irregular vehemence which had marked the changes in France seemed
proof only of an anarchy shocking to all respect for form or antiquity,
and sad evidence against the possibility of an orderly growth of reform.
"The French have shown themselves," said Burke, "the ablest architects
of ruin that have hitherto existed in the world. They have done their
business for us as rivals in a way which twenty Ramillies or Blenheims
could never have done." "How much is it the greatest event that ever
happened in the world and how much the best," said Fox after the taking
of the Bastille. While a third view, and this at first was Pitt's, rested
complacently on the possible approximation of the Government of France to
a constitutional monarchy similar to that of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETY_FIRST_REACTIONARY_MOVEMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETY_FIRST_REACTIONARY_MOVEMENT"></a>First reactionary movement.</div>

<p>The three years which elapsed between 1789 and the end of 1792
drew more distinctly the line which separated the two
first of these opinions, and proved that the third was
untenable. It was clear from the first which of them
would ultimately gain the upper hand among the governing classes
in England. Already, as early as March 1790, a proposition for the
relief of Protestant Dissenters, and for the abolition of Test and
<span class="sidenote">Rejection of the Abolition of Tests and of the
Reform Bill.</span> Corporation Acts, which had been lost by only a small
majority the preceding year, was thrown out by overwhelming numbers. A
Bill for the reform of the representation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1155" id="Page_1155">[1155]</a></span>
introduced by Flood, though Pitt had several times himself
brought the subject forward, met with a similar fate; and shortly after
the meeting of the new Parliament on November 25th, Burke issued
what may be regarded as the manifesto of his party in his work
<span class="sidenote">Burke's "Reflections on the French
Revolution."</span> entitled "Reflections on the French Revolution." It
was called forth by signs of the sympathy which the French Revolution was
meeting in England. Its more enthusiastic admirers had determined to reap
what advantages they could from the present state of excitement, and two
societies&mdash;the Constitutional Society, founded a few years before,
and the Revolution Society, an old established body connected with
the Dissenting interest, and intended to support the principle of the
Revolution of 1688&mdash;had entered upon a course of renewed activity.
On its anniversary, in November 1789, the Revolution Society had not only
listened to an inflammatory and revolutionary discourse by Dr. Price,
a Unitarian minister, but had also sent an address of sympathy, signed
by Lord Stanhope, their President, to the National Assembly, by whom it
had been rapturously received. It was upon this text chiefly that Burke
wrote. His book had a wonderful success, 30,000 copies were speedily
sold, and writers have been found bold enough to imply that the safety
of Europe was owing to this work. In truth, Burke saw more clearly than
those around him the inevitable course of the Revolution; he foresaw its
excesses and its miserable end in a military despotism; he saw, too, that
it must of necessity become proselytizing. Terrified by these dangers,
and unable to conceive the excellence of any government unlike our own,
which was at that time a highly aristocratic limited monarchy, he did
not see the truths which the French Revolution embodied, and which, had
they been wisely directed and not rudely assailed, would have allowed
Europe to pass into the new and inevitable phase of progress for which
it is still struggling, without the constant outbreaks of passion on one
side or the other which have marked the last seventy years. This work
drew forth many replies, the most important of which were Macintosh's
"Vindiciæ Gallicæ" and Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man,"&mdash;the first a
temperate and excellent work of the man who was afterwards to be one of
the greatest philosophical statesmen in England, the other the rough but
sensible production of a revolutionist by profession.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYONE_THE_CANADA_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYONE_THE_CANADA_BILL"></a>The Canada Bill. 1791.</div>

<p>The sentiments which Burke had declared in his essay he soon
took an opportunity of declaring in Parliament. The
question before the House was a new constitution for
Canada. This was called for by the extremely antagonistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1156" id="Page_1156">[1156]</a></span>
character of the inhabitants of the two parts of the colony.
The inhabitants of Lower Canada were French, and used to French
habits, those of Upper Canada entirely English. The province was
in future to be divided, and the constitution of the Upper Province
assimilated as nearly as possible to the English model. Hereditary
peerages even were to be established. The Bill, granting as it did a
sort of self-government to the colony, was a wise one, but Fox opposed
it, and took the opportunity of speaking in high praise of the new
constitution of France. Some days afterwards, upon the same
measure, Burke arose and proceeded to reply, inveighing strongly
<span class="sidenote">Breach between Fox and Burke. May 6, 1791.</span>
against the Revolution. His own side vociferously called him to order;
he persisted in his speech, deploring that he should be obliged to break
with his friends, but ready, as he said, to risk all, and with his last
words to exclaim, "Fly from the French constitution." Fox whispered there
was no loss of friends, but Burke rejoined, "I have done my duty at the
price of my friend; our friendship is at an end." Fox rose afterwards,
and with tears in his eyes repeated that he regarded Burke as his master
and teacher in politics, but he could not withdraw what he had said in
praise of the French constitution; and thus the friendship of years was
severed, and Burke was ranked with the ministerialists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Birmingham riots. July 1791.</div>

<p>But it was not only in Parliament that the strong division of opinion
caused by the Revolution was beginning to be evident. The conservative
temper of the upper and middle classes was shown clearly in the riots
at Birmingham. The friends of the Revolution had determined to have a
public dinner to celebrate the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille.
The dinner was chiefly planned by Dr. Priestley, a Unitarian minister, a
man of much scientific repute. Hearing that his movement was unpopular,
he attempted to postpone the dinner, from which he was himself absent;
some eighty persons however met, and in the evening a fierce riot broke
out against them; from Thursday till Sunday the riots continued, Dr.
Priestley's house and library were destroyed, and much wanton mischief
done. It was constantly reported, though never proved, that the
magistrates of the district, far from trying to check the rioters, had
been seen urging them on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's policy as yet unchanged.</div>

<p>Up till this point Pitt had certainly shown no sign of yielding to
the conservative feeling of the country. He had declared
distinctly that he intended to pursue a policy of neutrality,
to hold carefully aloof from any interference in the domestic
affairs of France, and had even entirely neutralized the effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1157" id="Page_1157">[1157]</a></span>
Convention of Pilnitz (Aug. 1791) by refusing to accede to the project
of concerted action on the part of European powers which had there
been broached. He even felt so certain of the continuance of peace,
that his Budget, in the spring of the year 1792, was framed entirely
upon a peace footing. He suggested the diminution of the number of
sailors by 2000; he allowed the subsidiary treaty with Hesse to come
to an end, and drew up a plan for the reduction of the interest of the
Funds from 4 to 3½ or 3 per cent. He even continued his measures
of improvement; he again supported, in a speech of unusual excellence,
the immediate abolition of the slave trade, although without
success; while, in conjunction with his great opponent, he carried
through a Bill for a change in the libel law known as Fox's Libel
Bill, which placed in the hands of juries the right of determining
not only the fact of the publication of a libel, but the more important
question whether the matter published was in its character libellous
or not. The opposition offered to this Bill by Lord Chancellor
Thurlow cost him his position; the Great Seal was put into commission.
But the crisis had in fact arrived. The events which had
taken place in France, and which continued to take place during the
year 1792, and the corresponding excitement aroused in England,
were gradually driving the minister to the persuasion that his peaceful
policy of non-intervention was no longer tenable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the French Revolution.</div>

<p>After its removal to Paris in October 1789, the Assembly, now under
the influence of the Jacobin Club, and watched by the Parisians,
proceeded rapidly in its work of destruction and reconstitution. All
local arrangements and provincial powers disappeared when France was
divided into Departments; the Crown lost its hold upon the judicial
system, which was now grounded upon a popular basis; the Church became a
department of the State, and the necessities of the State were supplied
by selling its vast property, or, as purchasers were not forthcoming,
by issuing bills payable in Church lands, called assignats. It became
plain that the power of the Crown, and with it the power of the
executive, was entirely disappearing. Nothing could save it but one
of two courses&mdash;the King might become a traitor to his country,
throw himself into the arms of his brother potentates, and begin a
war of kings against peoples, or, withdrawing from his capital, rally
round him all the conservative elements which yet remained in France.
<span class="sidenote">The King's flight to Varennes. June 1791.</span>
This was the plan of the one great man of the Revolution, Mirabeau;
but Mirabeau died in April 1791; and in June of the same year the King
adopted the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1158" id="Page_1158">[1158]</a></span>
and worse course, fled from Paris, and was arrested at Varennes.
He was brought back a prisoner, and remained with suspended authority
till the Assembly in September, hurriedly completing its work
of constitution-making, resigned its office. The King then resumed
his authority at the head of the new monarchical constitution, but with
power strangely clipped, and with an Assembly the leading members
of which, the Girondins (so called because their leaders were
representatives from the Gironde, a district near Bordeaux), eager and
ambitious men, preferred theoretically a republic, and believed that
their power would be best secured by plunging France into a war.
It is not in fact true to assert, as is commonly done, that it was the
attacks of the combined monarchs of Europe which drove France to
war. Much sympathy was no doubt felt for the disasters of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTWO_THE_GIRONDIN_MINISTRY_DECLARES_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTWO_THE_GIRONDIN_MINISTRY_DECLARES_WAR"></a>The Girondin ministry declares war. April

and princes had met with some success in Russia and Sweden. But both
those countries were far off. The more immediate antagonists of France&mdash;Austria
and Prussia&mdash;were prevented by their domestic jealousies, their fear
of Russia, and their relations with Poland, from at first dreaming of an
open assault upon France. It was for their own ends that the Girondins
stirred up the war spirit in France, and it could best be fostered by
exciting the popular feelings by suggestions of interference on the part
of foreign kings with the new-born liberty of the country, and by hinting
that the King himself was a party to this conspiracy. It was thus, taking
advantage of the sympathy which foreign courts no doubt expressed for the
King, that the Girondins demanded, in an overbearing tone, immediate and
satisfactory replies to their diplomatic questions, and failing these,
declared war upon Austria in the month of April 1792. Their declaration
of war was speedily followed by the reality of that union between Austria
and Prussia which they had falsely urged as an excuse for it. But the
Girondins had overreached themselves: by exciting the popular feeling
against the King they had played directly into the hands of the Jacobins;
and when the King, in June 1792, discarded his Girondin ministry and
attempted to rule with something like independence, it was only with the
aid of the Jacobins that they ultimately returned to power. For it was by
this extreme party, still further excited by the injudicious and
<span class="sidenote">The King suspended. Aug. 10.</span>
threatening manifesto which the Duke of Brunswick
had issued on the 25th of May, and by the ill success of
the opening of the war, that the great insurrection of
the 10th of August was carried out. The King was suspended from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1159" id="Page_1159">[1159]</a></span>
his functions, the Tuileries were taken, and though the Gironde was
nominally restored, the power of the State was really in the hands
of the Jacobins and the revolutionary Commune. The Legislative
Assembly lingered but a few weeks longer, to give place in September
<span class="sidenote">Massacres of September.</span> to a National
Democratic Convention. The brief space between the 10th of August and
the 21st of September was filled by the terrible consequences of the
unbridled triumph of the people. The royalist prisoners were murdered
in the prisons, the revolutionary Commune established in Paris, and
when the <span class="sidenote">Declaration of the Republic. Sept. 21,
1792.</span> Convention met, in the midst of fear at home and fear of
the advancing Prussians abroad, its first step was of necessity the
declaration of the Republic and the dethronement of the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolutionary character of the war.</div>

<p>Almost on the same day that the Convention opened, the advance
of the Prussians had been suddenly and unexpectedly
checked. Dumouriez had occupied the Passes of the
Argonnes, Kellermann had fought the cannonade of
Valmy, and the Prussians, bargaining for a safe retreat, began to
hurry homeward with ignoble speed. From this time onward the
character of the war changed, and became really dangerous to Europe.
A party more energetic than the Girondins was now in power.
Dumouriez had always recommended the conquest of Belgium for
political reasons; but war assumed a different aspect now that it was
in the hands of the Jacobins; it went hand in hand with the propagation
of revolutionary ideas. The victory of Jemmappes opened
the road to Belgium; in the South, Nice and Savoy completed the
desired frontier of the Alps; and the temper in which these conquests
had been achieved was rendered obvious when, a few days after the
battle of Jemmappes, the celebrated decree of the 19th of November
<span class="sidenote">Edict of Fraternity. Nov. 19, 1792.</span> was
issued, promising fraternity to all nations desirous of liberty, and
when, two days afterwards, Savoy was formed into a new department as the
Department of Mont Blanc. If further proof was needed of the character
of the war, it was afforded by the peremptory orders which were issued
to disregard all treaty obligations and to open the navigation of the
Scheldt, which treaty after treaty, guaranteed by France and other
countries, had closed, and the opening of which could not but bring
France directly into opposition both to Holland and to England. The chief
points to be remembered as affecting England are the declaration of war
with Austria, sought by the French, and upon old fashioned principles;
the fall of the Girondins, practically completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1160" id="Page_1160">[1160]</a></span>
on the 10th of August; the union of Austria and Prussia produced
by the war, but not contracted formally till after the death of Leopold;
the advance of the allies, the consequent establishment of the Jacobins;
the massacres of September; the summoning of the Convention; the check to
the allies at Valmy; the renewal of the war of aggression upon different
principles and with different success, those principles being illustrated
by the ordering of the opening of the Scheldt and the appropriation
of Savoy; while in Paris the completion of the second stage of the
Revolution was marked by the suspension and trial of the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change of opinion in England as to the
Revolution.</div>

<p>It was thus, with an enlarged knowledge of the principles and
inevitable course of the French Revolution, that Pitt had
to choose his conduct, and that in the course of this year
(1792) the English people finally divided itself into
parties, and in Parliament the old party names of Whig and Tory,
which had in fact since the Hanoverian succession lost their significance,
assumed a new meaning. The first movements of the Revolution
were generally hailed with enthusiasm in England. In the
grand march of the first days of the States-General and National
Assembly there was nothing at first obvious to shock English feeling.
On the surface it appeared only as if France had discovered, and was
determined to realize, the same truths which England had already
discovered; the people and the Crown appeared to be preparing to
act hand in hand against the monopoly of the privileged classes,
against the Divine right of kings, and for the establishment of that
official royalty which already existed among us. To the leaders of
the Whigs, who still erroneously believed that that party was the
really Liberal party, there was everything to excite enthusiasm in
the movement of the people, while Pitt himself could scarcely fail to
recognize that the very same process was being carried out to which
he owed his own elevation. But, by extraordinary mismanagement
on the part of the French Court, and by the sluggish, uncertain
character of the King, it came to pass that the cause of royalty
became unfortunately and indissolubly connected with the cause of
the privileged classes. The direction of the Revolution was shifted,
and the assault was directed not only against them, but against the
Crown; and not only against the Crown, in the sense that hereditary
kingship was attacked, but also against all vigorous executive of
which the King, even in his official capacity, might be regarded as the
representative. Now Pitt's administration may be regarded as a
popular triumph due to the union of King and people. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1161" id="Page_1161">[1161]</a></span>
quite untrue in England that the interests of the Crown and aristocracy
were one; the power of the Crown, in so far as it was antagonistic to the
power of the great families, was favourable to liberty. Nevertheless, the
ideas of the French Revolution did in fact receive considerable sympathy
in England, as was rendered more and more visible daily. The amount of
that sympathy assumed an exaggerated appearance under the influence of
the fear and horror created by the excesses in Paris, and the relation of
classes which had not existed in England, but which those who sympathized
with the Revolution chose to believe existed, did in fact arise. The
choice seemed again to be offered between people and King. And all the
privileged classes, and all the propertied classes, recognizing that a
strong executive meant order, and that a strong executive was represented
by the King, speedily made their choice, and gathered round the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of a new Tory party.</div>

<p>There was thus formed a new Tory party, having for its watchword,
"The Old Constitution," refusing to listen to any sound of reform or
change, regarding every measure in a popular direction as a preliminary
to popular excesses, the dominion of the uneducated, and the reign of
socialistic ideas. At the head of this party Pitt, of late so liberal,
placed himself, supported by Burke, the late Whig leader. Conscious of
the strength he had himself derived from the Crown, conscious of the
advances in liberty he had been able to obtain by means of his alliance
with it, and thoroughly shocked with the disorder and violence of
France, Pitt determined that of the two elements of the Constitution,
which seemed to be coming into opposition one with the other, it was the
Crown which at all hazards required the firmest support. To this new
Tory party, before long, the greater part of the Whigs gave in their
adhesion. But as a new Tory party was formed, so was a new Whig party.
Certain large-minded men, such as Grey, saw no reason why a panic should
check such obvious improvements as had already been set on foot. Certain
vehement party men, such as Fox and Sheridan, of large and warm hearts,
rejoiced when their feelings led them in the same direction as their
political opposition, and formed together a small but united band, to
whom the French Revolution was admirable, to whom war with France was
wicked, and every attempt at the repression of disorder a wanton act of
tyranny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy with the Revolution among the lower
classes.</div>

<p>It has been already pointed out that both the social and constitutional
condition of England afforded a good ground on
which sympathy for the Revolution might take root.
Not only were the numbers of the labouring classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1162" id="Page_1162">[1162]</a></span>
largely increased, not only was the condition of the labouring class
changing for the worse, the relations between capital and labour were
in a much less satisfactory state than they now are, every form of
combination among workmen was regarded as a crime, the line
between class and class was very strongly drawn. Country people
were complaining, in England as in France, of the absenteeism of
landlords, the employment of harsh middlemen, and the general resort
of all gentry to London. The Test Act and the penal laws were
regarded by those who were affected by them as relics of persecution,
all efforts to relax them were generally met with scornful rejection,
and, before all, the representation was in a condition which, but for
its evil effects, might be regarded as simply ridiculous. The sympathy
which might thus have been naturally felt was not left without
<span class="sidenote">Revolutionary societies.</span> instruction or
direction. Those who most strongly felt its influence speedily formed
themselves into societies, by whose means, in conjunction it seems
pretty certain with assistance from the French themselves, writings and
pamphlets, pointing out every flaw in the condition of England, and often
using language which was certainly seditious, were spread broadcast
among the people, and even among the soldiers. Of these societies by
far the most respectable was one known by the name of the "Friends of
the People." Its object was to excite and keep alive an agitation for
the removal of the inequalities of the representation. It included many
men of the greatest respectability, numbering twenty-eight members of
Parliament in its lists, and such names as Lord John Russell, Grey,
Sheridan, Erskine, and Lord Lauderdale. Far more dangerous were two
societies which arose early in 1792, with branches in many of the
chief towns of England. These were the London Corresponding Society,
numbering between 6000 and 7000 members, organized as a secret society,
and governed by a small secret committee of five, and a Society for
Constitutional Information, consisting of the more advanced and
thoroughgoing educated men of the time, and holding opinions of so
dangerous a character that the Society of the Friends of the People
thought it necessary to disclaim all connection with it. It was to check
the action of these societies that the two first retrograde actions of
Pitt were directed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rejection of Grey's motion for reform. April
1792.</div>

<p>The outcome of the work of the Society of the Friends of the
People was a motion brought in by Grey for a general reform of the
representation. To this Pitt refused his support. Two things were
necessary, he said, to induce a man to support a measure&mdash;the
possibility of carrying it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1163" id="Page_1163">[1163]</a></span>
possibility, when carried, of putting it into execution to the advantage
of the people; both these conditions were now absent, not only did he
believe that in the present state of feeling the Bill would infallibly be
rejected by the House, but also it could not now be carried out without
the greatest danger. The Bill was accordingly lost, and all
chance of carrying reform disappeared. Yet the necessity for it was
made very clear by a petition from the same society presented by
Grey in the following year, which exhibited in all its nakedness the
inefficiency of the representation, and proved that a decided majority
of the House was returned in fact by no more than 154 individuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclamation against seditious writings. May
21.</div>

<p>But while the respectable reformers were carrying out their efforts by
parliamentary means, the two less scrupulous societies went on issuing
papers and pamphlets to such an extent, that at length it seemed good
to Government to issue a royal proclamation warning the people against
seditious writings, and then to proceed to take legal measures against
them. This proclamation was issued on the 21st of May, and the address
moved in Parliament to thank the King for issuing it may be regarded
as the exact point at which the new division of parties sprang into
existence, for it was supported by many of the chief leaders of the
Whigs, and though an effort made by Pitt to strengthen his party by
a coalition with the Whigs failed for personal reasons, the Duke of
Portland, Wyndham, Thomas Grenville, and others, came back to their
allegiance to the wisdom of Burke, and joined henceforward in
<span class="sidenote">Diplomacy of M. Chauvelin.</span> the united
Conservative party. It is remarkable also for a second point which
connects it with the international aspect of the French Revolution.
M. Chauvelin had lately been sent over to England, with his far abler
secretary Talleyrand, as minister accredited by the French King. But
Louis' authority was little more than a shadow, and M. Chauvelin already
thought fit to enter upon that peculiar course of foreign diplomacy which
was characteristic of the revolutionists; he drew up a strong protest
against the Proclamation, and demanded that it should be laid before
Parliament. Of course Grenville, the Foreign Minister, had no alternative
but to send back the letter, with a sharp rebuke, explaining to him what
he seemed to have forgotten, the true position of a foreign minister.
This was the beginning of that diplomatic squabble which ended in M.
Chauvelin being dismissed from England.</p>

<p>But before the breaking off of diplomatic intercourse, the open
sympathy expressed for the changes which had taken place in
France had begun to rouse the fear of the governing classes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1164" id="Page_1164">[1164]</a></span>
England. The proclamation against seditious writings had but
<span class="sidenote">Congratulatory addresses sent to France by the
societies. Sept.</span> little effect compared with the exciting news
of the 10th of August, the massacres of September, and the retreat of
the allies. The societies thought fit to send deputations with addresses
of sympathy to the National Convention. The Revolution Society sent a
present of a thousand pairs of shoes for the army, and the Corresponding
Society, with four or five others of a similar character, sent a joint
address, congratulating the French upon their republican form of
government, especially admiring the outrageous conduct of the mob on the
10th of August, and even approving the sad events of September. Nor was
their energy confined to words. Riots broke out in several towns both
in England and Scotland. The most important were those in Sheffield and
Dundee. At Sheffield the disturbances took the form of a regular
<span class="sidenote">Riots in Sheffield and Dundee. Nov.</span>
revolutionary riot. It was on a day appointed for rejoicing
for the success of the French arms; a tree of
Liberty was planted, and the procession passed through
the streets, headed by an enormous picture of Dundas and Burke
plunging their daggers into the heart of Liberty. "They are as
resolute and determined a set of villains as ever I saw," writes an
officer who was quartered in the place, "and will gain their object if
it is to be gained; they have debating societies and correspondence
with other towns; they have purchased firearms, and are trying to
corrupt the soldiers." At Dundee almost the same events took
place; again a tree of Liberty was planted, and the cries of "Liberty,"
"Equality," "No excise," "No King," were soon universally heard,
though the ostensible cause of the riot had been the high price of
corn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The militia called out. Dec.</div>

<p>This state of affairs&mdash;the seditious conduct of the societies,
and the obvious tendency to riot&mdash;induced Pitt, in the beginning
of December, to call out the militia. This he could only do legally by
alleging insurrection as the excuse, and it was a somewhat strained
construction of the word to apply it to these outbreaks. But Pitt had now
made up his mind not only for repression in England but for war abroad,
and the summoning of the militia was intended in fact as a first step
in that direction. It was under these circumstances that an autumnal
Parliament was summoned. The discussions naturally turned upon the
conduct of the Government in calling out the militia, but Fox was unable

Government in internal matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_SIGNS_OF_APPROACHING_WAR" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_SIGNS_OF_APPROACHING_WAR"></a>Signs of approaching war with France.</div>

<p>Much more really important were the indications of the near
approach of war, given by the stress laid by the Government upon the
decree of November, the opening of the Scheldt, and the irregular and
unsatisfactory character of our diplomatic relations with France. From
the beginning of 1793, although there was no declaration of war between
England and France, it was perfectly clear that war was inevitable. An
<span class="sidenote">The Alien Bill. Jan. 4, 1793.</span> Alien Bill
was introduced, rendered necessary it was urged by the great assembly
of foreigners in England, chiefly royalist emigrants, but also in part
emissaries from the Jacobin government. Foreigners were by this Bill
ordered to state the object of their visit to England, to enter their
names on a register, and to obtain passports for moving to and fro.
The Bill was at once asserted by the French to be an infringement of
Pitt's commercial treaty of 1787, which had promised freedom of access
to French citizens. It was followed by measures even more stringent. The
exportation of all materials of war, the introduction and circulation of
assignats, and the exportation of corn whether English or foreign, to
French ports, were prohibited. While affairs were in this attitude, the
catastrophe for which Europe had breathlessly <span class="sidenote">Death
of Louis XVI. Jan. 21, 1793.</span> waited took place. Louis XVI. was
guillotined on the 21st of January 1793. A thrill of horror ran through
all classes of society, nearly the whole of London, and not the Court
only, appeared in deep mourning, and orders were almost immediately
sent to M. Chauvelin to leave England within eight days. The unofficial
connections between him and Lord Grenville had been kept up ever since
the King's suspension, but M. Chauvelin prided himself upon being in
close connection with the Opposition rather than with the Government, and
persisted in separating in his papers the interests of the Government and
of the people. He had offered explanations and produced a long letter
for the same purpose from Le Brun, the French Foreign Minister, with
regard to the decree of the 19th of November, but the explanation was of
a character to increase the irritation of the English. He had met every
measure of the Government with an angry protest: he justified the opening
of the Scheldt; he complained that he was obliged to enrol himself with
the other aliens; he declared that the prohibitory Bills were distinct
breaches of the treaty of 1787; and he was doubtless glad when the
consummation he had aimed at was reached and he was ordered to leave the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1166" id="Page_1166">[1166]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Efforts on the part of Pitt for the continuation of
peace.</div>

<p>Some slight pretence was still kept up on the part of the French of a
desire to keep the peace. M. Maret, well known afterwards as the Duc de
Bassano, was sent over to take M. Chauvelin's place. The object of his
mission is really unknown; he simply notified his arrival to Grenville,
held no communications with him, and very shortly returned to France
to find war already declared. At the same time another indirect offer
of negotiation arose, strangely enough in Belgium, where Dumouriez
desired an opportunity for a diplomatic meeting with Lord Auckland, our
ambassador. It speaks well for Pitt's real desire to treat if treating
were possible, that he at once accepted this proposition, holding
that a general in command of an army might treat, without any implied
recognition of the legitimacy or the stability of the Government which
employed him. But though the required leave was immediately sent to
Lord Auckland, it arrived too late, war had been already declared. It
is a further proof of Pitt's pacific tendencies, that when he agreed
to Dumouriez' proposal an embargo had already been laid upon English
shipping in the French ports, an act of war which he was willing to
overlook as long as any hope of negotiation remained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of the French for war.</div>

<p>But it may be fairly asserted, in spite of all that Fox and his
friends urged, that there was no real opportunity after the massacres
of September of treating with dignity with France. While M. Chauvelin
was attempting on the 27th of December to explain away the November
decree, on the 31st of the same month the Minister of the Marine wrote
thus to the seaports of France: "The Government of England is arming,
and the King of Spain, encouraged by this, is preparing to attack us.
These two tyrannical powers, after persecuting the patriots in their
own territories, think no doubt that they will be able to influence
the judgment about to be pronounced on the tyrant Louis. They hope to
frighten us. But no; a people that has made itself free, a people that
has driven out of the bosom of France the terrible army of the Prussians
and Austrians, this people will not suffer laws to be dictated to them
by a tyrant. The King and his Parliament mean to make war upon us. Will
the republicans of England permit this? Already these freemen show their
discontent, and the repugnance they have to bear arms against their
brothers the French; well, we will fly to their succour, we will make a
descent upon their island, we will lodge there 50,000 caps of liberty, we
will plant the sacred tree, and we will stretch out our arms to our republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1167" id="Page_1167">[1167]</a></span>
brethren; the tyranny of their government will be immediately
overthrown." In fact, as has more than once happened in our history, the
disturbance of a few reckless men, which our free constitution permits
to show itself without repression, was construed to mean what it might
mean in less free countries. Misinformed by their emissary Chauvelin who
saw but one party, willing to believe what they liked to believe, and
ignorant of the character of the English nation, the French had persuaded
themselves that there was a real division between the Government and the
people of England, and were eager for the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for the war.</div>

<p>That war they declared on the 8th of February, and by thus
forestalling what must have been sooner or later the action of the
English ministry, saved them from much difficulty. For there was
considerable difference of opinion as to what should be the <i>casus
belli</i>. England was pledged to neutrality, and was bound to France by a
close commercial treaty. The only two grounds on which, technically, war
could be declared, were the opening of the Scheldt and the destruction
of the balance of power by the appropriation of Savoy. England being
under distinct pledge not to interfere with the internal condition of
France, neither the massacres of September, the establishment of the
Republic, nor the death of the King, could with any justice be alleged
as a ground of war. The appropriation of Savoy was an evident fact, but
it was very plausibly urged that England, being in a state of professed
neutrality, had entirely disregarded the invasion of France by the great
Eastern powers, and had allowed to pass, without observation, the second
partition of Poland. The opening of the Scheldt was no doubt contrary
to treaties with Holland which England had guaranteed, but it was very
reasonably urged that England was not called upon to plunge into a war
unless Holland requested her to do so, and Holland remained studiously
quiet. The guarantee of the treaty had been to save Holland from war; it
might well seem a distortion of duty to force Holland into war for the
preservation of the treaty. There can be no doubt that the Opposition was
right in asserting that the war was declared against opinion; the point
in which they were wrong was this, that they did not recognize the fact
that opinion grown to a religion, a religion become propagandist in its
nature, and that propagandist religion in arms was the greatest social
danger which could threaten the world. Pitt and Burke saw this; the whole
body of Tories and conservative Whigs dimly felt it. But the trammels of
ages of diplomacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1168" id="Page_1168">[1168]</a></span>
were too strong to allow of the fact being openly recognized. It was
then with joy that the ministry found themselves released from their
difficulties by the French declaration of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French successes in the campaign of 1792-3, on the
Continent,</div>

<p>When England engaged in the war a campaign had already been
fought to the entire disadvantage of the allies. The
close of the year 1792 had seen the retirement of the
allies from French soil, the battle of Jemmappes, and the
occupation of Belgium and Savoy. The accession of
England, Spain and Holland to the coalition so far invigorated it
that its members believed that a campaign of a few months would
complete their work; for dangers surrounded the French Convention
on all sides. Dumouriez, a member of the Girondin party, displeased
with the conduct of the Jacobin Convention, was meditating
defection; the excesses of the governing party in Paris had aroused
all the slumbering loyalty of France; La Vendée was in arms for
constitutional monarchy and the Catholic religion; and both at
Lyons and Toulon the reaction was for the moment triumphant.
Dumouriez' treason had an immediate effect. Directly upon the
declaration of war he invaded Holland, but seeking rather popularity
with his army and the prestige of victory than the success of the
plans of Government, he turned aside from Holland, and risked a
battle at Neerwinden on the Gheet, in which he suffered a complete
defeat from the Prince of Saxe-Coburg; and thus as a defeated
general, and without his army, he gave himself up to the Austrians.
His defeat and defection allowed the allies to advance along the
whole frontier. But their movements were dilatory; instead of
marching upon Paris they wasted their time in taking Mayence,
Condé, and Valenciennes; they even committed the mistake of binding
the captured troops to refrain from war only against themselves;
they were therefore available to suppress the insurrection in La
Vendée, and the troops hitherto employed there could be sent to
the eastern frontier. The same want of energy continually marked
the progress of the allies. The Prussians and Austrians were in fact
too jealous of each other, and too much bent upon their interests
nearer home to act with vigour. Time was again wasted in sieges.
While the Austrians sat down before Cambrai, the Duke of York
with the English troops besieged Dunkirk. Their communications
were kept open by the Dutch at Menin and Hoondschoote. But the
French army, under the vigorous management of the Jacobins, and
guided by the military genius of Carnot, was no longer to be trifled
with; Houchard fell upon the weak position of the Dutch, and York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1169" id="Page_1169">[1169]</a></span>
was driven to a disastrous defeat with the loss of all his artillery.
The success was indeed only momentary; a panic seized the French
troops, and they fell back to Lille, thus affording the allies an opportunity
of advancing to the attack of the fortress of Maubeuge, which
closed the road to Paris; but Jourdan, who had succeeded Houchard,
now put in practice Carnot's principles. Hastily gathering 50,000
men, he fell upon half that number of Austrians, and completely
defeated them at Wattigny. Success had also attended the French
against the Prussians on the Upper Rhine. There, too, the terrible
rigour of the new Government had restored the aspect of affairs.
St. Just and Lebas had appeared as conventional commissioners in
Alsace, bringing terror with them. The beaten armies were supplied
and organized. Two young generals of the revolutionary school,
Hoche and Pichegru, were placed in command, and the tide of victory
was turned; the Prussians had to fall back, compromising the
advanced position of the Austrians, and before the close of the year
the French army, which had begun the campaign with a series of
disasters, found itself victorious along the whole frontier line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and against the royalists in France.</div>

<p>The Convention had also been successful in its wars in the interior
of France. After six weeks of bombardment, on the 9th of October, Lyons
yielded, without conditions, to be given up to the fearful cruelty of
Collot d'Herbois; and the victorious troops hurried southwards to besiege
Toulon, which had placed itself in the hands of the English, and had
admitted the allied fleet to its roadstead. The genius of Bonaparte
is said to have secured its capture. He saw that one fort called the
Equilette commanded the roadstead, and that its possession would oblige
the English, who were the soul of the defence, to withdraw. The capture
of the fort answered his expectation; Lord Hood, without making terms for
the inhabitants, collected such of the royalists as could crowd on board
his ships, and sailed away, having first set fire to all the stores, and
to forty ships of war which were in the harbour (Aug. 27, 1793). The
insurrection of La Vendée had also been suppressed. Intrusted at first
to ignorant men, with no claim to command except the strength of their
revolutionary principles, the Convention troops had been everywhere
defeated. But when Kleber was put in practical command the course
of victory changed. Terribly defeated, and with all their chiefs of
importance mortally wounded, the insurgents determined to try the fortune
of war upon the other side of the Loire. They marched northwards towards
Laval, defeated their pursuers, and had they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1170" id="Page_1170">[1170]</a></span>
made common cause with the Bretons might still have been successful.
But trusting to help from England, which never came, they undertook
a fruitless assault upon Granville in Normandy. Thinking themselves
betrayed, and longing for their homes, the ill-organized mass of peasants
insisted on being led southwards: even then there was some life in them.
They defeated the republican General Rossignol and threw him back upon
Rennes; but failing in an attack upon Angers, they marched pointlessly
towards Le Mans. They were there received with terrible slaughter by
Westermann, Kleber and Marçeau; 18,000 men, women and children were
killed, and the rest fled, pursued by the pitiless Westermann. The
fugitives reached the Loire, fought one final battle at Savenay near
its mouth, where they were all, with the exception of some eight or ten
thousand men, either put to death or captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's difficulty in keeping up the coalition.</div>

<p>Thus revolutionary France had proved itself no contemptible enemy
to the united troops of Europe, and established its rule unquestioned
in France. It was plain that all hope of an easy subjugation of France
was over, and it was with the greatest difficulty that Pitt was able to
keep the coalition together; the eyes of Prussia were eagerly bent upon
Poland, an easier prey than France. Of increase of territory England
had no hope; the war had been forced on her, and was honestly a war of
opinion. But any cessation of her efforts would have placed her in a
worse position than when the war began, and Pitt and the upper classes of
England were not blind to the fact that the occupation of the continental
nations in the great war afforded England immense advantages both at
sea and in the colonies; it was worth making great efforts to gain the
undisputed mastery of the sea both in commerce and in arms. Nor did the
large sums of money, raised chiefly by way of loan, appear so ruinous as
they really were. The effect of large loans is to increase the wealth
of the capitalist at the expense of the working man; nor, as the chief
weight of the accumulating taxation falls on posterity, does it become
immediately evident. Thus supplied with almost unlimited means, Pitt
succeeded in keeping up the coalition, taking into English pay, it is
almost true to say, the whole of the Prussian army, and doing nearly as
much for the Austrians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continued success of the French in 1794.</div>

<p>Pitt's energy was equalled by that of France, and the Convention
had the additional advantage of being free from constitutional
rules. Vast conscriptions filled their armies,
forced requisitions supplied them with arms and equipments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1171" id="Page_1171">[1171]</a></span>
It was with the army of the North, 160,000 strong, under Pichegru,
that the English had most to do. On each side the armies were
divided into three divisions, and the duty of marching with 100,000
men on Paris was intrusted to Coburg. Defeated in the centre, the
French had met with unexpected success on the left, Clairfait, the
Austrian general, having been twice beaten at Moucron and at Courtray.
Upon this, Pichegru almost destroyed his centre to strengthen
his wings, and the threefold man&oelig;uvres became twofold. The key
of the campaign was the possession of the Sambre; the Austrians
lay in an advancing angle with their left upon that river from Mons
to Charleroi. If the French could cross the Sambre they would be
virtually in the rear of the Austrians. To this point, therefore, the
Commissioners of the Convention, St. Just and Lebas, repaired, and
attempted to inspire the troops with something of their own enthusiasm.
Again and again the French were driven back. But Carnot's
plan of massing troops was at length employed; the greater part of
the army, which under Jourdan had been facing the Prussians on
the Moselle, was turned northward, and Jourdan took command of
100,000, well known as the army of the Sambre and Meuse, just as
the Commissioners had been driven back for the fifth time behind
the river. After a sixth failure, the Commissioners insisting upon
a seventh effort, the river was successfully crossed, and on the heights
of Fleurus a battle was fought in which, though it was not completed,
the Austrians were practically defeated. Step by step the English and
the Austrians retired, the one towards Holland, the other towards
the Rhine. By July the English were behind Breda, the Austrians
beyond the Meuse. Want of supplies checked the French advance
for a few weeks, but by October the English were driven into the
corner between the Yssel and the Rhine, and the army of the
Sambre and Meuse had captured Cologne and Coblenz. The occupation
of Belgium by the French compelled the Prussians further
south also to fall behind the Rhine, the left bank of which was
thus in possession of the French army from Basle to the sea. Even
south of that point successes had been won. The Sardinian
position of Saorgio had been turned, and the passes of the Alps
were opened to the French, who were thus in a position to invade
Italy on the one hand and Holland on the other. The lateness
of the season, and the wretched state of the equipment and commissariat,
might have induced the French to be satisfied with these
conquests, and few armies would have thought of facing an unusually
severe winter shoeless and in rags, for to such a plight had the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1172" id="Page_1172">[1172]</a></span>
management of the Revolutionary Government brought them. But
to this army of enthusiasts the winter was but a useful ally for the
conquest of Holland, where a strong feeling in their favour already
existed among that large section of the people, who had seen with
anger their attempted Revolution of 1787 suppressed by the arms of
Prussia, and to whom the Government of the Stadtholder was very
distasteful. The failure of the preceding campaign had obliged Pitt
to insist upon the recall of the Duke of York, much to the King's
displeasure, and Pichegru now found himself opposed to General
Walmoden, the Hanoverian commander. But of opposition there
was really none. The lines of the three great rivers, the Meuse, the
Waal and the Lech, were abandoned without a fight, and crossed by
the French, either upon the ice or by means of pontoons; and
finally Walmoden left Holland to its fate, and retreated across the
Yssel and the Ems to embark his army safely in Bremen. The

1795.</span> Stadtholder had already fled from the Hague and taken refuge
in England. Amsterdam was occupied by the French without difficulty, the
ragged regiments waiting patiently in the bitter snow in the streets of
the rich city till their quarters were arranged for them without the
least attempt at disorder. A striking finish was put to the campaign by
the capture of the Dutch fleet in the Texel. The ships were ice-bound,
and fell into the hands of a regiment of cavalry, who galloped across the
ice to secure them. Holland was at once erected into a republic upon the
French model.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indirect advantages gained by England.</div>

<p>But in spite of these continual reverses of the allies, in spite of
the perpetual failure of the British arms in the Low Countries, Pitt had
not been mistaken in the indirect advantages which the war would give
him. The conflagration at Toulon had inflicted an almost irreparable loss
upon the French fleet. In Corsica the veteran patriot Paoli had aroused
the feeling of his countrymen against France. Nelson and Hood, with 1000
British soldiers serving as marines in their ships, had taken Bastia,
which was regarded as almost impregnable, and the people of Corsica had
begged King George to accept their crown. While thus in the Mediterranean
English supremacy had been established, a still greater success had
attended her fleet off the coast of France. By immense exertions a
powerful and well-equipped fleet of twenty-six ships had been assembled
by Bon St. André and placed under the command of Villaret Joyeuse. It
left the harbour of Brest for the purpose of convoying a large fleet
laden with flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1173" id="Page_1173">[1173]</a></span>
from America. The English Channel fleet, under Lord Howe, sailed to meet
it. In number of ships and weight of metal the English fleet was somewhat
inferior, but the Revolution had stripped the French marine of its best
officers, who had habitually been supplied by Brittany, now royalist in
its tendencies. Bon St. André, originally <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_DEFEAT_OF_THE_FRENCH_FLEET" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_DEFEAT_OF_THE_FRENCH_FLEET"></a>Defeat
of the French fleet. June 1, 1794.</span> a Calvinistic clergyman, had
all the fearful energy belonging to the Conventional Commissioners, but
little of the skill of a seaman, yet he frequently overruled the commands
of Villaret Joyeuse. Thus, when the fleets met upon the 1st of June,
the French were unable to prevent Admiral Howe from repeating Rodney's
well-known man&oelig;uvre of breaking the line. The defeat of the French was
complete; several ships went down, and five line of battle-ships remained
as English prizes.</p>

<p>Upon the Continent, however, success had been wholly on the side
of the French; the campaign of 1794 and the winter of 1795 had
added Belgium, Holland, the left bank of the Rhine, part of Piedmont,
Catalonia, and Navarre, to their dominions. The coalition
began at once to fall to pieces. As it was plain that there was no
further hope of a military promenade to Paris or of territory to be
gained at an easy price, the King of Prussia, who had been only
kept up to the mark by enormous subsidies from England, made his
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_PRUSSIA_SPAIN_AND_HOLLAND" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_PRUSSIA_SPAIN_AND_HOLLAND"></a>Prussia, Spain and Holland leave the
coalition.</span> peace with the French. It was the pressure of England
alone which had driven Spain and Holland into the war. Although Pitt
had procured a change of ministry in Spain in accordance with his own
views, and the substitution of Godoy for Miranda, the Spanish Government
now awoke to its true interests. All the advantages of a maritime war
of necessity fell to the lot of the English, and Spain saw herself
aiding in the destruction of the only efficient rival to the English
upon the sea, and thus in fact rendering certain her own insignificance
on that element. The Spanish Government was therefore willing to treat.
Holland, completely conquered, and with half its population preferring
the French rule to that of the Prince of Orange, who had been forced upon
the country, obtained peace by giving up its chief fortresses, paying a
large indemnity, and making an offensive alliance with France against
England, by which thirty ships of war were placed at the disposal of the
French. Many of the smaller states both of Germany and Italy declared
themselves neutral. England was thus practically left without allies,
with the single exception of Austria, which was only induced to continue
its engagements by a subsidy of four millions and a half. This series of
treaties was completed in the course of the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1174" id="Page_1174">[1174]</a></span>
1795, chiefly by Barthélemy at Basle; the treaty with Tuscany, Feb. 9;
with Holland [at the Hague], May 15; with Prussia, April 5; and
with Spain, July 14.</p>

<p>The campaign of the following year, 1795, was confined to the
Rhine, where Pichegru commanded the army of the Rhine and
Moselle, Jourdan that of the Sambre and Meuse. Pichegru was
meditating treachery, and lay idle opposite the Black Forest till the
advance of Jourdan from the North to co-operate with him for the
purpose of retaking Mayence forced him into action. He took
Mannheim, and might have taken Heidelberg, but he wilfully resigned
this advantage, and fell back in disorder upon the lines of Weissembourg,
where he signed an armistice with the Austrians preparatory
to joining them. His retreat had compelled that of Jourdan also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection of La Vendée.</div>

<p>The English meanwhile had engaged in a lukewarm way in an expedition
which, had it been carried out with vigour, might have changed the face
of affairs. After the great destruction of the Vendéan army at Savenay,
the war continued to smoulder both in La Vendée itself and in Brittany.
But north of the Loire it assumed a somewhat different character; the
open, simple and heroic devotion of the Vendéan peasantry, who had
followed their priests, gentry, and leaders of their own rank to battle,
was wanting, and the hostilities of Brittany assumed rather the form of
brigandage than warfare. The country was infested with small bands, who
kept up connection with one another by means of private signals, but who
seldom appeared in large numbers, and worked chiefly by night-surprises
and by rapid and secret cutting off of detached posts. The chief man of
the Chouans, as the Breton insurgents were called, was Cormatin. But
certain men of higher rank were also among them; the chief of these was
Count Joseph de Puisaye, a man of considerable energy and ability, who
had been a member of the National Assembly. De Puisaye saw that irregular
warfare could produce but little effect, and desired to obtain assistance
from England, where the Government was supposed to be ready to assist any
endeavour against the French Republic; an impression kept alive by the
rumours, probably much exaggerated, spread by agents who were constantly
passing and repassing through the Channel Islands between France and
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition from England planned.</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1794 De Puisaye betook himself to England
and laid his plans before Pitt. It was suggested that 10,000 British
troops should be joined with the corps of emigrants, and
should land in Brittany and seize Rennes, and thence
push forward at once over Normandy, Maine and Poitou.
It was thought advisable that a prince of the blood should either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1175" id="Page_1175">[1175]</a></span>
accompany the expedition or shortly appear upon the scene, and the
Count of Artois was selected for the purpose. Lord Moira, favourably
known in the American War as Lord Rawdon, was to take command
of the English troops. But though speed and secresy were of the
first necessity, the expedition hung fire, and news of it reached the
ears of the French Government. The reason for this delay was
partly jealousy and disunion among the emigrants themselves,
partly Pitt's mistrust of the readiness of the French to join him,
and his knowledge of the danger of relying on the assertions of
sanguine exiles, and partly the discovery of the feeling existing
among the royalists themselves in La Vendée and Brittany against
the introduction of any large foreign army; for the belief seems to
have been prevalent that Pitt's objects were selfish, and that an
English army would be rather a danger than an assistance. It is at
all events certain that the royalists in Paris, in their dislike that
the reaction should be brought about by any means but their own,
did their best to injure the expedition. The consequences of the
delay were serious. In spite of considerable sums of money sent
from England, and a good deal more much cheaper money, consisting
of forged assignats, which were exported largely, in the
spring of 1795 the skill of Hoche and Canclaux, the generals opposed
to the insurgents, and the very favourable terms offered by the
Convention, induced the chiefs both of the Vendéans and of
the Chouans to accept an amnesty. The terms offered were
certainly unusually tempting. A large indemnity of several
millions of francs was to be given to the people to repay them for
their losses; the houses that had been burnt were to be rebuilt;
ten millions were to be given to the chiefs to take up the bonds that
had been issued in their names during the insurrection; Charette
was to be allowed to keep up 2000 men in the pay of the Government,
freedom of religion was to be granted, and there were to be no requisitions
in La Vendée for five years. The agreement was made as solemn
as possible. The first to accept it was Charette, with whom the
treaty was signed with great pomp in the city of Nantes in February.
Subsequently, in April, Stofflet gave in his adhesion to the same
arrangement, and finally the Chouans did the same. It seemed a
proof of their sincerity that they gave up into the hands of the
Commissioner of the Convention nearly a million of forged assignats,
which they had received from the English fleet round the coast;
but on the part of the insurgents it appears that this treaty was
illusory, forced upon them by the delay of the English. It was
used however as an additional ground for refusing large assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1176" id="Page_1176">[1176]</a></span>
and it was an army of emigrants only, with a considerable quantity
<span class="sidenote">Destruction of the expedition to Quiberon.</span>
of stores and money, which in July of 1795 at length
set sail from England. Even then the plan of De
Puisaye was overruled for the worse. For the sake of
a good roadstead for the English fleet, it was arranged that the
landing should be upon the peninsula of Quiberon, close to Carnac,
instead of in the north of Brittany; and again, apparently in mistrust
of De Puisaye's partisan system of warfare, it was thought necessary
to give him as second in command a royalist emigrant of the name
of D'Hervilly, a red tape soldier, who had displayed considerable
courage on the 10th of August, but who was a very bad man for the
present irregular warfare. It even seemed doubtful whether his
authority did not supersede De Puisaye's, and after Quiberon was
reached, it was thought necessary to send an appeal to England to
settle this weighty question. Meanwhile, after two days of delay, the
troops were landed at Carnac. They were received with an enthusiasm
so riotous and irregular, that the commander's love of discipline
received a severe shock, and he ceased to trust his wild allies.
However, in three days they were joined by some 10,000 men, and
De Puisaye was eager to rush forward and raise the whole of the
neighbouring country, but the answer from England had not yet
been received, and the troops waited on in inactivity. At length
something was done. A small fort called Port Penthièvre covers the
little isthmus which joins the peninsula of Quiberon to the shore.
D'Hervilly proceeded to bring up all his artillery, but before his
operations were completed, De Puisaye and a few hundred Chouans
had gained possession of the place without difficulty. With his
regular troops in the peninsula and holding the fort, and with his
Chouans spread along the mainland, De Puisaye was compelled to
remain inactive. All the jealousies which existed among the
royalists burst out, and even worse than that, time was allowed for
General Hoche to increase his 5000 troops, which might easily have
been routed, to double that number. He suddenly attacked the invaders,
and drove the whole mass, Chouans, emigrants, and all, to the
narrow confined peninsula. Their efforts to break loose were unavailing;
fresh emigrant troops under Sombreuil came from England. De
Puisaye's authority was confirmed, but it was too late. Some republican
troops taken in Fort Penthièvre had been admitted to the
emigrant ranks. They entered into treacherous correspondence with
Hoche's army, and by their assistance the fort was recaptured. The
exit from their peninsula was thus entirely closed to them, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1177" id="Page_1177">[1177]</a></span>
enemy's cannon was placed along the corresponding shore, and swept
the isthmus and the roadstead, while the republican troops, advancing
from the fort, drove the invaders backward into the corner of
the tongue of land. They were literally driven into the sea. The
scene was a fearful one. Many in despair threw themselves upon
their own swords, many tried to reach the boats of the fleet, and were
a ready mark for the republican musketry. Some thought themselves
fortunate in reaching fishing-boats which were hovering about the
coast, but in zeal for their own preservation the boatmen lopped off
their hands and suffered them to sink. Some 900, with De Puisaye
at their head, reached the English squadron and were saved. About
700, under De Sombreuil, made, as they thought, terms with General
Humbert, but the conditions were only verbal, and included, as the
French asserted probably with truth, a reference to the Convention.
The reactionaries in power were glad of the chance of freeing themselves
of the charge of favouring the royalists. Orders were given that
the law against emigrants taken in arms should be carried out to the
letter. The prisoners were brought out in batches and shot upon the
seashore till 700 of them had been killed. After this the fate of the
insurgents was sealed. In the following year (1796) the Count of
Artois again appeared upon the coast, and Charette and Stofflet were
again in arms, but the Count of Artois was content to remain in
idleness at L'Ile Dieu, and Hoche succeeded in the difficult work of
at once conquering and conciliating all that remained of the insurrection.
Charette and Stofflet were both captured and shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confidence of the English in Pitt.</div>

<p>There can be but little doubt that when war was first declared
the feeling of the English people was very strongly in favour of it.
Accustomed for years to trust to Pitt, they continued their perfect
confidence in him though his policy had changed, and, as we have seen,
the opposition in the House of Commons was virtually destroyed. The
confidence of the nation was chiefly exhibited in the readiness with
which it met all the demands for increased taxation and for immense
loans; in fact, Pitt was strongly supported by the commercial classes.
With them the war was in itself popular, they were clearsighted enough to
see how vast was the opening likely to be afforded them by the increase
of English power upon the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased by his assistance in a financial
crisis.</div>

<p>In the year 1793 Pitt gained a fresh right to their gratitude by
the assistance he afforded them during a brief monetary
crisis which threatened to be very destructive.
The year had been one of great financial difficulty. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1178" id="Page_1178">[1178]</a></span>
sudden expansion of manufacturing industry which had followed upon the
great inventions at the beginning of the reign, and the increase of
commerce which followed the close of the American War, had rendered
necessary a large amount of capital. The want had been met by a largely
increased paper currency. Reckless banking had become prevalent, and
provincial banks issued notes far beyond their capital. A very slight
panic would be enough to cause the collapse of such a system. It was
found that to meet the necessities of the exchange between England and
the rest of the world bullion would have to leave England. Bullion was
already scarce, and the Bank of England therefore thought it necessary to
restrict its issues. This was enough to cause the failure of a few great
houses; a panic ensued; there was a run upon the provincial banks; out of
350 more than 100 failed. Yet there was in reality quite enough property
both in securities and in goods to enable merchants to meet all demands.
It was only for the moment that there was a deficiency of money, that
is, of the means of exchange. Pitt, with admirable clearness, recognized
the real solvency of the country, and authorized the issue of bills on
the Exchequer to the value of five millions. These were advanced to
merchants, who could prove their solvency, against securities or goods.
As these bills rested on the credit of the nation, they were readily
received, the engagements of the merchants were satisfied by their means,
and credit was restored. As it proved, not more than four millions was
borrowed, and the whole sum was speedily repaid without loss to the
nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of Pitt's new policy of repression.</div>

<p>The effect of the complete trust placed in Pitt was to allow him to
give full rein to his new policy. Now that policy was one entirely of
repression, and the effect of it in the long run, indeed before the year
was out, was to divide England much more sharply into the propertied and
non-propertied classes, and to bring into existence a state of feeling
highly undesirable, and which tended much to produce those very evils
it was intended to prevent. While every movement in a liberal direction
was certain to be checked, laws of the most stringent description
were willingly passed, and at first the execution of existing laws,
especially with regard to seditious writing, received great public
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_THE_TRAITOROUS_CORRESPONDENCE_BILL" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_THE_TRAITOROUS_CORRESPONDENCE_BILL"></a>The Traitorous Correspondence Bill. March 15,
1793.</span> support. In this class may be mentioned the Traitorous
Correspondence Act. There has always been great dislike to tampering with
or extending the law of treason, yet there were but fifty-three members
of the House of Commons who could be found to lift their voices against this Bill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1179" id="Page_1179">[1179]</a></span>
which declared guilty of high treason, firstly, all those who supplied
any arms or military or naval stores to the enemy; secondly, all those
who purchased lands in France, for the use of assignats rendered the
sale of land the chief support of French finance, and the purchase of
land was therefore regarded as indirectly strengthening the hands of
the enemy; thirdly, it prohibited all intercourse with France without
special license under the Great Seal; and fourthly, the insurance
of French vessels by English merchants. The two first of these offences
were to fall directly under the old law of Edward III., and to
deprive those who were guilty of them of the advantages secured to
them by the ameliorations of the law which had since been made,
such as the right to employ counsel, and to be furnished with the list
of the jury, the necessity of two witnesses to secure conviction, and
the lapse of a certain period between the indictment and the trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trials for seditious writings.</div>

<p>But it was chiefly in the prosecution for seditious meetings and
seditious writings that the character of the Government showed itself.
The best known of these in the year 1793 was that of Muir. This young
man, a member of the Society of the Friends of the People, was indicted
for spreading the works of Thomas Paine. He defended himself with
great ability upon the ground that he had only aimed at the reform of
Parliament. His speech was greeted with loud applause, but the Lord
Justice-Clerk summed up most strongly against him, and asserted the
strange doctrine that the Government was made up of the landed interest.
"As for the rabble," said he, "who have nothing but personal property,
what hold has the nation on them?" He sentenced Muir to fourteen years'
transportation. The severity of the judges and the frequent trials
that the Government ordered had not the effect of checking the popular
feeling. Delegates from various parts of Scotland, in concert with the
Friends of the People and other societies, assembled at Edinburgh. The
leading spirits were Maurice Margarot and Joseph Gerald, agents from
London. These delegates assumed the name of a convention, spoke of the
first year of the British Republic, and otherwise mimicked their French
brethren. In December the law came upon them, and three of them, with
Margarot and Gerald, were transported for fourteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt resists the growing desire for peace,</div>

<p>Up till this time the people as a whole had been heartily with
Pitt; but the course of the year had tended to change
their feelings, the war had been by no means the light
undertaking expected, and it began to be seen that its
continuation meant fearful expenses, heavy taxes, and a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1180" id="Page_1180">[1180]</a></span>
government but little in accordance with the general character of English
administration. Some even of Pitt's old friends began to whisper of
peace, but his will was not one to yield to opposition. In Parliament
he was still supreme, and in this first beginning of difficulties he
exhibited the greatness of his energy and his resources. He branded with
fierce words, which reminded his hearers of his great father, all who
dared to think of peace; he openly avowed that the idea was impossible
till some total change took place in the French Government, thus putting
his actions on their true basis. Backed by his commercial friends,
he found means to continue the subsidies to Prussia and Austria, he
purchased the adhesion of several of the smaller German states, induced
the Spaniards to continue a war which was wholly against their own
interests, and obliged the lesser Italian states to join the coalition;
he even allowed Russia to perpetrate the second partition of Poland as
a price of her neutrality. With such efforts as these he contrived to
carry on his war; it was not unreasonably that he became the ogre of the
French, the one object of their insatiable hatred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and continues the prosecutions for seditious
writings.</div>

<p>At home he would not abate one jot of his policy. Again the
prosecutions went forward. So little had the late action of Government
been successful that discontent and the intrigues of the societies were
becoming even more envenomed. The English had taken a leaf out of the
Scotch book; two of the great societies&mdash;the Constitutional Society
and the Corresponding Society&mdash;determined that they too would
have a convention. It seems to have been a far more real and dangerous
thing than the Scotch convention. The workmen were stirred up, meetings
were held in all the great towns attended by delegates from London,
revolutionary songs were composed and circulated, and a considerable
number of weapons constructed and secreted. It was the intention of the
Convention to overawe Parliament somewhat in the same way as the Jacobin
Club overawed the French Assembly. The Government determined to act as
strongly as possible against it, and instead of accusing the leaders of
seditious practices merely, they thought it advisable to treat their
conduct as a great and capital crime, and to bring them to trial for high
treason. The leaders arrested were Hardy, Secretary of the Corresponding
Society, Adams, Secretary of the Constitutional Society, Horne Tooke, the
well-known opponent of Junius, the Rev. Jeremiah Joyce, author of the
"Scientific Dialogues," and tutor to Lord Stanhope's sons, Thelwall, a
political lecturer of some importance, and three others. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1181" id="Page_1181">[1181]</a></span>
secret committee of the House, having examined their books and papers,
reported that there were ample proofs of a traitorous conspiracy for
overawing Parliament. Upon this report the Government advanced a step
further, and in spite of the eager opposition of the minority, carried
through the House the suspension of the Habeas Corpus. Trials for
high treason followed both in England and Scotland. In Scotland the
prosecution was successful, but the English trials did not go off so
smoothly. Hardy was tried first on the 28th of October. Sir John Scott
(afterwards Lord Eldon) conducted the prosecution; but although the
evidence, if true, tended to show that language of a most seditious
character had been used, and weapons and plans of insurrection made,
yet the skill and eloquence of Erskine, who laid his chief stress on
the grave constitutional danger of any enlargement of the Treason Act,
procured an acquittal. The Government was not satisfied, Horne Tooke was
also tried. He defended himself with his usual effrontery and humour, and
again an acquittal was obtained. Still the Crown persisted, and Thelwall
the lecturer was tried; again the accused was acquitted. The excitement
about the trials was intense, the speeches of the rival barristers were
listened to with extreme interest, and the acquittals were hailed with
the wildest enthusiasm. It was plain that a considerable change had
taken place in the feelings of the people; the strings of repression had
been drawn too tight; the line between class and class was becoming more
sharply marked.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_PORTLAND_JOINS_THE_MINISTRY" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_PORTLAND_JOINS_THE_MINISTRY"></a>Portland and his friends join the ministry. July
1794.</div>

<p>The same fact is rendered obvious by the completion in this year
of the consolidation of the new Tory party. Ever since the middle of
1792 the Duke of Portland and his friends had voted with Government,
but they now openly joined it, and were admitted to some of the best
places. The Duke of Portland became Secretary for the Home Department,
Earl Fitzwilliam Lord President, and Mr. Wyndham Secretary at War.
The one point which connected the new recruits with the ministry was
the determination all felt to carry on the war. Pitt was therefore
hampered in two directions. When Parliament was opened on the 13th
of December 1794, there appeared to be a growing feeling in
<span class="sidenote">Desire for peace.</span> favour of peace, and
Pitt found himself opposed to many of his old friends, the country
gentlemen; but his union with the Duke of Portland and his party
rendered a change of policy at present impossible. He was in the hands
of the war party; afraid of losing their support, and buoyed up by an
idle belief in the financial exhaustion of France, he determined still
to carry on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1182" id="Page_1182">[1182]</a></span>
war vigorously. As he was quite paramount in Parliament<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in spite
of an increased minority, he had no difficulty in getting leave to raise
a loan of eighteen millions, and to guarantee another large loan to
purchase the co-operation of Austria. He nevertheless slightly changed
his tone, and confessed that he should be satisfied with a peace that
gave him security, and allowed later in the session that there was a
possibility of treating with the present Government of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_THE_PRINCE_OF_WALES_MARRIAGE" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_THE_PRINCE_OF_WALES_MARRIAGE"></a>The Prince of Wales' marriage. April 8, 1795.</div>

<p>Amongst other minor difficulties which he had to meet was the
constant embarrassment of the Prince of Wales. Seven
years before he had purchased the payment of his debts
by a lie concerning his wife; he was now again £700,000
in debt; the only terms on which he could hope to get relieved
were that he should marry legally, and the King had chosen for him
a Princess of Brunswick whom he had never seen. Lord Malmesbury
arranged the negotiation, but unwisely suppressed, what he
saw clearly himself, the absolute unfitness of the lady for the position
she was to occupy. He found her frivolous, slovenly, and quite
deficient in tact. It was impossible but that she should be distasteful
to any English gentleman. Very shortly after the birth of her
child a formal separation took place, and a scandalous dispute arose,
which afterwards turned into a great party conflict. For the present
however, the Prince received the price of his unfortunate bargain.
The royal message demanding the assistance of Parliament was
couched in humble language, and asked only for some arrangement
by which the debts should be ultimately paid; but even thus it
excited a perfect storm in the House. None even of the Prince's old
friends rose to defend him, and Pitt himself, though no friend of the
Prince, intreated that the matter might not be examined by a Parliamentary
Committee, for fear of the damaging effect of such an
inquiry on the principle of an hereditary monarchy. It was finally
arranged that the Prince's income should be raised from &pound;72,000 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1183" id="Page_1183">[1183]</a></span>
&pound;125,000 a year, that the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall should
be set apart, which in twenty-seven years would extinguish the debt,
and that &pound;25,000 a year more should be devoted to pay the interest.
To these enactments was added an extraordinary one, rendering the
Prince's servants liable for any contract they should enter into on his
behalf, and limiting legal remedy against the Prince to the term of
three months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sufferings of the lower classes. 1795.</div>

<p>Such demands upon the public purse seemed very badly timed,
when the working classes were suffering very heavily
from depression of trade, from famine produced by two
bad harvests, and from a constantly increasing burden
of taxation. Discontent was in fact increasing widely, great political
meetings were held in London and elsewhere to expose the abuses
of monarchy and aristocracy. Riots and seditious writings were constantly
on the increase, and the Government thought the state of
affairs so critical that they determined upon an autumn session.
Three days before Parliament met a monster meeting was held under
the auspices of the Corresponding Society in Copenhagen Fields.
The excitement thus produced found vent in an assault upon the
<span class="sidenote">Assault on the King.</span> King as he went to
open Parliament, one of the windows of his state coach was broken by
a stone or bullet; on his return his coach was again surrounded by an
angry mob, with shouts of "Bread, bread! peace, peace!" and he only
escaped with difficulty by driving rapidly in his private carriage from
St. James's to Buckingham Palace. The King, who throughout showed great
courage, showed himself in the evening at Covent Garden theatre, where
he was on the whole well received. This act of violence produced two
coercive Bills, one to suppress seditious meetings, the other to extend
the law of treason. Every public meeting was to be advertised by a paper
signed by resident householders, and all meetings were liable to be
dispersed according to the Riot Act if any two justices thought them
dangerous; while by the second law, writing, preaching, and speaking,
were created overt acts, thus rendering the offender guilty of treason,
and writing or speaking against the established Government was made a
highly punishable crime. These Bills were commonly known as the Sedition
and Treason Bills. They were not passed without strong opposition, and
the use of language on the part of Fox so vehement as to excite still
further the anger of the Tories. This party was now enjoying its selfish
triumph to the utmost. It became necessary again to augment the taxes,
and Pitt hit upon the expedient of levying duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1184" id="Page_1184">[1184]</a></span>
upon legacies and successions. The country gentlemen had sufficient
influence to confine the Bill to the succession of money and personal
property only, and to exclude real property from the action of the Bill.
This glaring injustice was not remedied till 1853.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in France give hopes of peace.</div>

<p>The burden of taxation had much to do with the overtures for peace
which were set on foot in 1796. Nearly all classes in the kingdom had
become weary of the war. Pitt, as has been seen, had been forced into it
against his natural tendencies, and though, when once embarked in the war
of opinion, he had used language of the most overbearing character, he
was eager, now that he found his hope of a speedy bankruptcy of France
frustrated, to bring about an honourable peace. Such an opportunity was
offered by the changed character of the French Government. The Directory
had held its position for upwards of a year, and seemed to give promise
of such stability as would render negotiation possible. This change in
the Government of France had been the outcome of a series of revolutions
which had followed each other in rapid succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_RETROSPECT_OF_FRENCH_AFFAIRS" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_RETROSPECT_OF_FRENCH_AFFAIRS"></a>Retrospect of French affairs. 1793.</div>

<p>The Girondins had, contrary to their conscientious opinions, voted for
the death of the King. It was in fact an act of suicide.
After this it was useless to oppose any demand of the
Jacobins; the attempt only produced a violent struggle
in the Convention, which ended in the complete overthrow of the
Girondins by the insurrection of the 1st of June. In the place of
the party thus annihilated the Jacobins found themselves supreme.
Upon them henceforward lay the duty of saving the Revolution
within and rescuing France from foreign assaults from without. The
machinery of Government to which they trusted to obtain these ends
was a Committee of Public Safety, in whose hands the full powers of
the executive were lodged. As far as the external defence of France
was concerned, the restless energy of the new rulers was completely
<span class="sidenote">The Committee of Public Safety.</span> successful.
La Vendée, Toulon, and Lyons, the centres of opposition within France,
were all reduced. Carnot struck out a new plan of warfare, and found
means to employ with success the masses with which an almost unlimited
conscription supplied the army, and from this time onwards the French
were everywhere successful. But while exhibiting this energy abroad, in
France the government of the Committee was in the last degree cruel and
tyrannical. Nor could the Jacobins agree among themselves. On the one
side was a party atheistical in their religion, communistic in their
political views, foul and blasphemous in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1185" id="Page_1185">[1185]</a></span>
language. This party, which predominated in the Commune, took
its name from Hébert, the editor of an infamous paper called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Père
Duchesne</i>. It shocked the feelings of the world by its excesses,
abolishing religion, closing the churches, and holding a blasphemous
service in Notre Dame in honour of Reason. On the other side was
a party, headed by Danton, intent chiefly on success abroad, and
inclined to believe that the work of destruction had gone far enough.
Between the two was the party of the Purists, headed by Robespierre
and St. Just, who looked with equal hatred on the scandalous and
anarchical conduct of the Hébertists and the indulgent and somewhat
loose lives of the followers of Danton. Robespierre was able to
attack and destroy both these parties in turn. The Hébertists were
the first to fall, but very shortly after the same fate befell the
Dantonists.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_THE_REIGN_OF_TERROR" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_THE_REIGN_OF_TERROR"></a>The Reign of Terror.</div>

<p>Atheists and indulgents being thus both removed, Robespierre and
his party were virtually masters of France. Under them
the Terror knew no relaxation. "The maxim of our
policy," said Robespierre, "ought to be to guide the people by reason
and the enemies of the people by terror." Whole batches of victims
completely unknown to each other were sent off together to the
guillotine under pretext of being accomplices in conspiracy. Between
the 20th of June and the 27th of July 1400 people were executed.
But Robespierre and his friends looked forward to some conclusion
of this state of things, desiring to establish a purely moral, stoical,
and deistical Republic. As a first step, the worship of the Supreme
Being was decreed, and a great festivity held, where Robespierre,
decked with flowers, officiated as priest. Thus, too, he began to shelter
the priests and nobles. The idea of the cessation of the Revolution
thoroughly frightened some of the worst among the Committee, and
Robespierre's assumption of authority disgusted them. They contrived
to form a coalition with all the discontented parties, Hébertists,
Dantonists, Girondists, Royalists, were all ready to combine against
the one man whose stoical purity seemed to insult them, and whose
cold implacable cruelty gave them no hope if they should offend him.
Robespierre was thus hated by the people, and at enmity both with
the people and the Committee, but was still influential at the club
of the Jacobins, the Convention, and the revolutionary Tribunal.
Knowing that an assault would be directed against him, his wisdom
would have been to strike first. To this course St. Just urged him,
but he seems to have relied upon his influence in the Convention,
and was astonished when he found his friends wholly outnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1186" id="Page_1186">[1186]</a></span>
and a hearing refused him. On the 27th of July he was arrested
<span class="sidenote">Fall of Robespierre.</span> with Couthon, St.
Just, and his brother. He escaped and fled to the Commune. For a moment
it appeared as if an insurrection would have reinstated him. But the
richer sections of Paris rallied to the destruction of their tyrant, and
on the following day Robespierre, with twenty members of the Commune, was
dragged to the scaffold.</p>

<p>The party which had overthrown Robespierre were as cruel and
far more depraved than he was. They would gladly have continued
the Revolution in its most odious form. But the Terror once
destroyed, it was impossible to check a reactionary movement. The
revolutionary Committee and Tribunal were modified, the Commune
destroyed, the club of the Jacobins dissolved, and the Girondins
who had escaped execution recalled. Such measures did not please
the mob of Paris, still further excited by the constant continuance of
famine. On the 12th Germinal (April 1), and again on the 1st Prairial
(May 20), they rose in insurrection, invaded the hall of the Convention,
clamouring for bread and the constitution of 1793. For
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_THE_DIRECTORY_ESTABLISHED" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_THE_DIRECTORY_ESTABLISHED"></a>Establishment of the Directory. Oct. 1795.</span>
six hours a wild tumult raged within the walls. But soldiers had been
collected, and with the aid of the troops of the more reactionary Paris
sections order was restored. This was the deathblow of the democratic
party. A new constitution was drawn up, the executive power was vested
in five directors, and two councils, the one of 500, the other of
250, established. The hopes of the royalists had been raised by the
late reactionary movement. Finding themselves thwarted by the new
constitution, the richer sections and the partisans of reaction marched
on the Tuileries. General Menou proved unequal to his place, and the task
of defending the Assembly was given to Barras, who chose as his active
lieutenant Bonaparte. With a vigour unchecked by fear of shedding the
blood of citizens, this young officer brought up thirty cannon from the
camp of Sablons, and received the advancing insurrectionists with such
showers of grape, that, though not without a short resistance, they were
completely defeated. This was the first step towards military despotism.
The new constitution came into effect on the 27th of October 1795.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSIX_PITTS_FIRST_NEGOTIATIONS" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSIX_PITTS_FIRST_NEGOTIATIONS"></a>Pitt's first negotiations for peace.</div>

<p>Thus, before it was understood how completely the army had got the
upper hand in France, how completely from henceforward its interests
would be military, the appearance of something more like a permanent and
orderly government in the shape of the Directory seemed for the instant
to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1187" id="Page_1187">[1187]</a></span>
hopes of peace. Towards that point Pitt's feelings had been gradually
tending. Even as early as December 1795 he had spoken of the possibility
of an honourable peace should a more settled government ever be arrived
at in France, and since then much had happened to induce him to lower
his tone. In spite of all his efforts, he had seen his great coalition
disappear at the Congress at Basle. He had seen the complete ruin of
his Quiberon expedition. More than that, all his best tendencies had
been shocked by the consequences of his own government at home. But the
opening of his eyes to the fallacy of his belief in the speedy bankruptcy
of France and its rapid conquest, with which in all his difficulties he
had hitherto buoyed himself up, came too late. His application for peace
through the Swiss minister (March 1796), which the King announced at the
close of the session, met with a very cold reception. For the Government
of France, having just been re-established on a new and more dangerous
basis, would listen to no terms which implied the restoration of the
Low Countries to Austria; and as it was impossible for Pitt, after his
conduct to that country, to suggest any other terms, the negotiations
speedily came to nothing.</p>

<p>Indeed, the French Republic had this year reached a pitch of glory
unequalled in the palmiest times of the monarchy. Carnot, who was again
in power as one of the Directory, had conceived a plan for a campaign
of this year upon a gigantic scale. Three armies were to push out from
France and strike all of them by the three different roads, of the Maine,
the Danube, and the Po, at Vienna. Three young generals were intrusted
with the task. Jourdan was given the army of the Sambre and Meuse, Moreau
the army of the Rhine and Moselle, Bonaparte succeeded Schérer in the
command of the army of Italy. The preceding year the battle of Loano
had secured to the French the Riviera as far as Savona, but the troops
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon's Italian campaign. 1796.</span>
were destitute of every necessary. Napoleon aroused their enthusiasm by
promises, and in a fortnight had separated the Austrians and Piedmontese,
defeated the former at Montenotte and Dégo, and thrown them back into
Lombardy, the latter at Millesimo, and again at Mondovi, as he pursued
them towards Turin, and finally wrung from them a treaty which left him
at liberty to pursue the Austrians. Another fortnight was hardly over
before he had turned the Austrian position on the Ticino by the passage
of the Po at Placenza, driven them from the Adda by the victories of
Fombio and Lodi, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1188" id="Page_1188">[1188]</a></span>
chased them behind the Mincio, secured the whole of Lombardy to the
French. Bonaparte completed the first act of the campaign by securing
the line of the Adige and forming the siege of Mantua. He employed some
weeks in conquering Italy as far south as Naples, but from this work he
was recalled by the approach of an Austrian army to raise the siege of
Mantua. Wurmser came down the Adige on one side of the Lake of Garda,
Quasdanowich down the Chiesa on the other. Bonaparte, giving up every
other object for the moment, placed himself between the armies, defeated
Quasdanowich, at Lonato on the one hand, and Wurmser at Castiglioni
on the other, and thus driving them into the Tyrol, resumed the siege
of Mantua. Wurmser made one more effort to raise the siege; again he
advanced with two armies, hoping to enclose the French. Davidowich
descended the Adige, Wurmser the valley of the Brenta. The battle of
Roveredo destroyed the former, while Bonaparte, turning rapidly into the
valley of the Brenta in pursuit of Wurmser, came up with and defeated
him at Bassano. Thus cut off from Germany, the Austrian general had no
resource but to take refuge in Mantua (Sept. 12). The Austrians could
not leave their army thus shut up in Mantua, and a fresh effort was
made to save it. It was again a double attack, but after three days'
fight, Alvinzi, coming from the east, was beaten at Arcola, and the
attempt failed. Six weeks later he made one more desperate effort, but
was defeated again on the plateau of Rivoli. Alvinzi's attack had been
rendered the more dangerous, because upon the Maine and Rhine Jourdan
and Moreau had been unsuccessful. There the Archduke Charles had in a
certain degree followed the same plans as Bonaparte, and directing his
whole force against Jourdan, had compelled the retreat of Moreau also.
It was to this victorious general that the Austrians looked to continue
their defence. But Bonaparte, in the beginning of the following year,
repeatedly drove him backwards, defeated him on the Tagliamento, drove
him into the mountains, and defeated him at Neumarck, and finally,
having secured the pass of the Semmering, and being within eighty miles
of Vienna, he obliged the Archduke to demand a suspension of arms, and
opened negotiations known as the Preliminaries of Léoben (April 13),
which were completed under the title of Campo Formio on the 17th of
October 1797.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's second negotiations for peace.</div>

<p>On the Rhine and the Maine the two other divisions of the general
plan had not met with the same success as had attended
the arms of Bonaparte. Great and astonishing as his
progress had been, it did not therefore seem as yet to have closed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1189" id="Page_1189">[1189]</a></span>
hope of peace, for which in fact it had only rendered Pitt more
anxious; and as the establishment of the Directory seemed to promise
that permanence to the Government which Pitt had declared to be the
indispensable condition of any hopeful negotiations, it was determined in
the autumn of this year (1796) to make a fresh effort, this time direct,
to negotiate with the Directory. For this purpose Lord Malmesbury was
despatched to Paris. The English believed that they had something they
could offer in exchange for any restorations France might make. The Cape
of Good Hope had been captured in the preceding year, and in the spring
of the present year Moore and Abercrombie had done good service in the
West Indies. Many of the islands there had been taken, Guadaloupe almost
alone remained in French hands. These conquests they offered to restore.
But if the French had been unwilling to treat in the preceding year,
their successes in Italy had not rendered them more moderate; they were
at this very time arranging, at the instigation of the malcontents in
Ireland, represented by Wolfe Tone, a plan for the conquest of Ireland
under the command of General Hoche, and probably a still greater plan
for the invasion of England itself. In fact, there was still the same
irremediable objection&mdash;the English still felt bound in honour not
to resign the Netherlands to France. "On this point," writes Grenville
in his instructions to Malmesbury, "your Lordship must not give the
smallest hope that his Majesty will be induced to relax." There was also
another point in the French diplomacy which rendered the negotiations
difficult. They could not understand the position of a plenipotentiary
who had not absolutely full powers to act without reference to his own
Court, and taking umbrage at the repeated couriers who went to and fro
from Paris, declared their belief that the effort at peace was not
honest on the part of England, and that Malmesbury had not full powers
at all; and finally, De la Croix, a somewhat stiff man of the red tape
school, who had from the first behaved with considerable rudeness,
wrote suddenly to Malmesbury bidding him leave Paris within eighteen
hours. Thus closed the second effort on the part of Pitt to make peace,
chiefly important because it clears him from the charge of inveterate
determination to continue the war, because it throws the blame of that
continuance completely on the French, and because it shows the effect
which the lengthened efforts of England, especially the pressure on the
finances, were having upon the naturally peaceful and economical mind of
the minister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations to resist the threatened French
invasion.</div>

<p>The preparations for invasion from abroad could not be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1190" id="Page_1190">[1190]</a></span>
secret, and fresh and constant efforts had been made to meet them.
Fresh levies were made both for the navy and for the
army; supplementary bodies of militia were raised;
plans suggested for the establishment of large bodies of
irregular cavalry, and the enrolment as irregular infantry of all
those who paid a gun license. More than this, in spite of the pressure
on the finances, under which the funds had fallen as low as £53, a
new loan of £18,000,000 was raised upon terms which, though we
should now think very high, were not then considered remunerative.
The loan, which bore a nominal interest of 5 per cent., was issued
at £112, 10s.; that is, every £112, 10s. advanced was to represent
£100, thus practically reducing the interest to less than 4½ per cent.
Pitt found it necessary to make a distinct appeal to the loyalty of
the people to raise the loan on these terms; but the temper of
the wealthy classes and the amount of riches still existing in England
were shown by the extraordinary rapidity with which the subscription
list was filled. £1,000,000 was subscribed by the Bank in
their corporate capacity, £400,000 by the directors individually;
before the close of the first day £5,000,000 was subscribed by different
merchants. At ten o'clock on the Monday the doors were opened,
and by twenty minutes past eleven the subscription was declared to
be full; hundreds were reluctantly obliged to go away. By the post
innumerable orders came from the country, scarcely one of which
could be accepted, and long after the subscription was closed persons
continued coming, and were obliged to depart disappointed.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
Duke of Bridgewater sent a draft on sight of £100,000, a similar sum was
even given by the Duke of Bedford, one of the staunchest opponents of the
war. The Ministry subscribed £10,000 a piece.</p>


<div class="sidenote">French expeditions to Bantry Bay and Bristol.</div>

<p>Such an outburst of loyalty might have opened the eyes of the French
as to the difference between the revolutionary temper of England and of
their own country, but their ignorance of the temper both of England and
Ireland was extreme; General Clark (subsequently Napoleon's War Minister)
was at this very time asking Wolfe Tone whether he thought it probable
that in case of a landing in Ireland the Irish Lord Chancellor would join
the rebels. On the 15th of December the great expedition for Ireland
set sail from Brest. Like so many invasions of England, it was thwarted
by the uncertainties of the sea. After a stormy passage a few ships
assembled in Bantry Bay; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1191" id="Page_1191">[1191]</a></span>
the general had been driven in another direction; there were no signs of
the eager Jacobin uprising which the French had expected, the commanders
were afraid to proceed without orders from Hoche, and the expedition
straggled back again to Brest, with the loss of four line of battle-ships
and eight frigates. A similar untimely fate met a more desperate
assault intended for the shores of England. Some 1500 men, two-thirds
of whom were liberated galley-slaves, and from their character known
as the "Légion noire," were sent under Colonel Tate with the intention
of burning Bristol. They landed on the shores of Pembrokeshire, and
it needed but the appearance of a few militia and yeomanry under Lord
Cawdor (and it is frequently said of a few old Welsh women in their red
cloaks and hats) to induce the crew of miscreants to take to flight.
The expedition was probably only intended as a sort of forlorn hope to
discover in what state of preparation England was, for the negotiations
having entirely ceased, the French were thinking of a great attack on
England itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Critical condition of England.</div>

<p>The idea of invasion was a well-timed one; at no time in the war,
either before or after, was England in so critical a condition or its
existence so precarious. It had become plain by this time that the
strength of England, at all events under the present management, lay in
two directions&mdash;in its enormous resources and capacity for paying
money, and in its fleet. Though such troops as had been employed had
exhibited their usual bravery, though when well led, as in India, their
efforts had met with great success, it was evident that the present
ministry, hampered by their political relations and by the incessant
interference of the King himself in the army, was unable to make any
real show in the European war. But already in the last four years nearly
eighty millions had been added to the National Debt, every variety
of taxation almost had been tried both to cover the interest of the
accumulating debt and to supply the yearly million to the sinking fund,
and men began to think that the sources of money must shortly begin to
fail. And yet the subsidized armies abroad had met with nothing but
disaster. The North of Germany, including even the King's electorate
of Hanover, had been driven to enter into a neutrality. Prussia had in
the last year signed two conventions of the most amicable and friendly
description with France; and the well-known selfishness of the Austrian
Court did not allow it to be questioned that, if it saw its way to
permanent advantage, it also would close its disastrous campaign by
deserting the coalition. Worse even than that remained behind; it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1192" id="Page_1192">[1192]</a></span>
as if the country was really upon the verge of a national bankruptcy,
for the amount of specie was found insufficient to carry on the business
of the country. At the same time that the financial strength of England
seemed to have been fruitlessly exhausted, her permanent power upon
the sea seemed on the point of disappearing also; for not only had the
French been lately turning their attention to their own navy, but the
successes of their arms had given them the command both of the fleets of
Holland and Spain. Holland, formed into the Batavian Republic, had early
purchased peace by promising thirty ships: in the July of the last year
Spain had entered into a similar convention, and the whole of her naval
resources, as many as forty line of battle-ships, were at the disposal
of the French. It was with these combined armaments that the intended
descent upon England was to take place. And just as the internal ruin had
gone hand in hand with the failure of external financial influence, so it
appeared that the new-born naval power of our enemies would go hand in
hand with the total dissolution of our maritime force: for disaffection
was widely spread among our sailors, and the year was marked by the
mutinies of St. Helen's and the Nore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monetary crisis.</div>

<p>In point of time it was the financial difficulty which first arose.
The difficulty was not what is called a commercial but a monetary crisis.
There was no want of credit, there was no want of solid wealth, but
there was every chance of there being such a dearth of the circulating
medium that the ordinary transactions of business would not be able to be
carried on, that it would be impossible to meet engagements as they fell
due, and that consequently many houses would be forced to stop payment,
and a general bankruptcy be the result, more especially as it seemed
probable that at the head of the banks that stopped payment would be
the Bank of England itself. The causes of this state of things are not
very difficult to understand. The same forces which had been at work to
produce the necessary issue of Exchequer bills in 1793 had continued; the
balance of trade had been constantly against the country. The position
of Spain, Italy, France and Holland in the ranks of our enemies had of
necessity curtailed the number of our purchasers. The necessity of war
supplies and several poor harvests had rendered necessary the purchase of
much food and of much raw material, consequently to restore the balance
large payments in gold and silver had to be made. The great subsidies
granted to foreign powers had necessarily been chiefly paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1193" id="Page_1193">[1193]</a></span>
in specie. Large compensation had been given for the freights and
cargoes of neutral ships which had been seized; and the Government
for their special purposes had had to borrow upwards of ten millions
in specie from the Bank. Threats of invasion had induced people
throughout the country to realize their property as far as possible;
this had produced a run upon the country banks, which had in turn
demanded their deposits from the Bank of England. All these
accumulated causes had so lowered the reserve, that on Saturday the
20th of February there was only £1,272,000 in the Bank cellars, and
it was known that the demands of the next forty-eight hours would
entirely empty them. In this crisis the Bank applied to the
<span class="sidenote">Suspension of cash payments.</span> Government; a
Council was immediately held, although it was Sunday, and a proclamation
was issued forbidding payments in cash. A meeting of merchants next day
sanctioned this step, promising to accept bank notes as legal tender. On
examination the Bank was found solvent, but a Bill was passed prohibiting
it to pay in cash more than twenty shillings, or to advance to Government
more than £600,000. Though only intended as a temporary expedient, this
Act continued in operation for twenty-two years, and during the whole
of that time the depreciation of the paper money was comparatively
slight.</p>

<p>The danger caused by the mutiny was still greater: it was the
intention of the French Directory that the fleet of the Texel, composed
entirely of the Dutch, the fleet at Brest which had been collected for
the invasion of Ireland, and the great Spanish fleet, should combine.
Thus, an armament of more than seventy ships of the line would
sweep the English fleet from the Channel, and any operations against
<span class="sidenote">The threatened invasion checked by the victory of
St. Vincent.</span> the island would be rendered safe. But the check
sustained by the Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent ruined the
well-conceived plan. A few days before Tate landed in England, the great
Spanish fleet set sail from Carthagena, intending to join the French
fleet off Brest and the Dutch fleet off the Texel, and thus secure the
mastery of the Channel. Sir John Jervis was Admiral in the Mediterranean,
and with him was Commodore Nelson, and though the Spanish fleet had
twelve more ships than he had, and 1200 more guns, he determined to
fight. He contrived to separate nine Spanish ships from the main body,
and took four of the remainder, and though the separated ships joined the
line in the evening, and Jervis was still outnumbered, the Spanish fleet
retired into Cadiz.</p>

<p>But though the combined invasion was thus thwarted, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1194" id="Page_1194">[1194]</a></span>
danger for England, or rather for Ireland, was by no means at an end.
Hoche had been removed from the army of the Ocean to the army of the
Sambre and Meuse. His mind was constantly bent upon the invasion of
Ireland, and, acting under his influence, the Dutch Government, wishing
to do something to show that they were not entirely effaced from the list
of nations, with great efforts strengthened and equipped their fleet at
the Texel till it numbered fourteen sail of the line, and embarked in it
their whole army, 15,000 men, for an attack upon Ireland. The Directory,
taking umbrage at this independent action, insisted upon Hoche, with
5000 men, accompanying them, and on their refusal began again to get
ready their Brest squadron for a similar expedition. To watch the Dutch
became the duty of Admiral Duncan, the care of Brest was intrusted to
Admiral Bridport with the fleet at Portsmouth. Fortunately for England,
the sailing of the fleets was delayed; had they sailed in the summer, as
intended, they would have found England without fleets.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_THE_MUTINY_AT_SPITHEAD" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_THE_MUTINY_AT_SPITHEAD"></a>Mutiny at Spithead.</div>

<p>Early in the year a conspiracy was discovered among the crews of
the fleet at Spithead, with a view to demanding redress of certain
grievances. These grievances were shared in by all the seamen in the navy
and were very real. The pay and pensions had never been altered since the
time of Charles II., though every necessary of life had risen from thirty
to forty per cent.; this neglect was rendered particularly objectionable
as the pay and pensions of the army had been increased to suit the times.
Many officers were appointed by interest alone, and a system of barefaced
peculation was carried on by those who had the duty of provisioning the
fleet, for the ships were furnished in a great degree by contract through
the purser; moreover, all the nautical arrangements were at this time
remarkable for extreme roughness, almost brutality, for unjust severity
of discipline, for arbitrary power vested in the hands of the captain,
and frequent misuse of that power. When Lord Bridport, Lord Howe's second
in command, signalled to put to sea, every ship in the fleet refused
to obey; and the next day delegates from every ship met in the 'Queen
Charlotte,' and the mutiny was organized. The men behaved with perfect
decorum, and drew up a petition, asking that their wages should be raised
to suit the rise of prices in every direction, and that some improvement
should be made in their system of pensions. To the Admiralty they sent a
petition, exposing the peculations of the pursers and the unwarrantable
hardships to which the sailor was exposed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1195" id="Page_1195">[1195]</a></span>
Admiralty acknowledged at once the justice of the claim for advanced
wages, but were silent upon the other abuses. This did not satisfy the
men: three admirals were sent to treat with them; and when an outburst of
anger on the part of one of them broke off the conference, the red flag
of mutiny was hoisted and the guns loaded. However, when their demands
were granted in full, and a free pardon was sent them from London, they
at once returned to their duty. During the whole of the outbreak perfect
order had reigned. But the folly of the Admiralty, who, wishing to save
their credit, sent down a perverse order that the marines should be kept
constantly ready to suppress mutiny, led the sailors to believe that they
were being deceived, and a second outbreak was the result. An attempt to
suppress it by force on board the 'London' ended in a real mutiny among
all the ships then lying at St. Helen's, outside Spithead. Lord Howe,
the most popular of the admirals, known among the sailors as "Black
Dick," was intrusted with the difficult task of recalling the fleet to
its allegiance. With great skill he contrived that while their requests
were granted, they should seem to be receiving rather than demanding a
favour. He persuaded them to write a letter of contrition to himself,
and apparently as the fruit of his good offices, announced to them that
an Act of Parliament had been passed securing to them the redress of
grievances they had demanded, and that considerable changes were to be
made among the officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mutiny at the Nore. May 15.</div>

<p>This wholly unpolitical mutiny was followed by a more formidable
movement among the ships at the Nore. It began on board the 'Sandwich,'
the flagship of Admiral Buckner. As in the former case, delegates from
the seamen met on board the 'Sandwich,' but the chief management of
the mutiny fell absolutely into the hands of a seaman called Parker,
a man of good education, and at one time an officer in the navy, but
whose abilities as a leader were spoiled by his arrogant assumption of
dictatorial power. Under his influence the demands of the mutineers
assumed a political character; they required a revision of the Articles
of War, an increase of prize-money, and the dismissal of officers not
agreeable to the ships' companies. All efforts to bring the men to reason
were unavailing. Lord Spencer himself, the First Lord of the Admiralty,
had an interview with Parker, but was met with nothing but insult. After
this the mutineers fired upon some frigates who would not join them, and
blockaded the Thames. It became necessary to take vigorous measures.
Bills were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1196" id="Page_1196">[1196]</a></span>
passed without opposition strengthening the hands of Government, and
making it felony to hold intercourse with the mutinous ships. Ships
were got ready, the navigation of the Thames was rendered difficult
by the removal of marks, and batteries were erected along the river.
Cut off from the shore, and finding no sympathy among the fleets at
Portsmouth and Plymouth, nor among even the most advanced radicals on
shore, although they were joined by the fleets of Admiral Duncan, the
mutineers began to give way. Ship after ship slipped her cable and
escaped from the mutinous fleet, and on the 15th of June the 'Sandwich'
herself was brought within range of the batteries. Parker was at once
apprehended, sentenced to death, and hanged. But though the firmness of
the Government had secured them complete victory, they were too conscious
of the real abuses in the navy to be severe. Only four or five executions
followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real loyalty of the sailors.</div>

<p>The great peculiarity of the mutiny was the ease with which it was
ultimately suppressed and the proofs of underlying loyalty which are
visible throughout it. In the Channel fleet all the offers of the
Admiralty, and even of Parliament, were regarded as delusive till the
King's own sign manual was exhibited, upon which all signs of mistrust
at once vanished. When one of the ships threatened to leave the fleet
and join the French, the guns of the rest of the mutinous fleet were
at once turned upon it, and it was carefully blockaded by guard-boats;
and again, so far from sympathizing with the mutineers of the Nore, the
sailors of the Channel fleet, after their return to allegiance, wrote to
the delegates declaring that their conduct was a scandal to the British
navy. Even at the Nore, where the mutiny had taken a more political form,
every ship but one struck the red flag and hoisted the royal ensign on
the King's birthday, and within a few weeks of the suppression of the
disaffection, the battle of Camperdown, one of the severest engagements
of the time, was chiefly won for England by the crews of the lately
insurgent fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorganization of the French Government.</div>

<p>It was well for England that the Government of France was at this time
so disorganized that no vigorous effort could be made to take advantage
of her deplorable condition. The place of the assignats had been taken
by another form of paper money called "mandats," but these too had been
rejected by the people, who could no longer be brought to believe in
paper money of any description. Forced to have recourse to the use of
specie, the Directory had also found itself compelled to have recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1197" id="Page_1197">[1197]</a></span>
to the old means of raising money; compulsory loans were established,
the receipts of future years anticipated, the national goods sold for
whatever they would fetch, and money raised at the most ridiculous
interest. These financial arrangements gave rise to much nefarious
speculation and stock-jobbing; the business of the army to still more;
and the newly enriched speculators, emancipated from the pressure of the
terror and devoid of all the nobler sentiments of republicanism, were
a mere set of selfish voluptuaries. In such a dissolution of morality
and public spirit it was plain that the royalists had their chance,
and in the year 1797 sufficient members of their party were elected
to change the majority of the two councils. The representative body
immediately entered into a struggle with the executive Directory; and in
that Directory were Barras, a revolutionary at heart though the leader
of all the dissoluteness of the time, Barthélemy, the negotiator of
Basle, who appears to have been royalist in his tendencies, and Carnot,
an upright republican, but yet under the influence of the dread of the
old terror. It was plain that if the Revolution was to be saved it must
be done by violent means, and Rewbell and Laréveilière, the remaining
directors, with the assistance of Barras, determined to save it at the
cost of a <i>coup d'état</i> carried out by the army. On the night of the
18th Fructidor (Sept. 4, 1797), Carnot and Barthélemy, with fifty of the
obnoxious majority, were arrested, and all chance of a royalist reaction
was for the time over. Bonaparte was now convinced that the ultimate
fate of France must be with the army, in other words, that it must lie
with himself, but with great wisdom he determined to wait the turn of
events.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations at Lisle.</div>

<p>While the parties were thus struggling in France, and there seemed
a chance of an entire change of feeling, the English ministry, very
seriously anxious for peace, again opened negotiations. The Preliminaries
of Léoben had in fact removed what should have been the sole difficulty;
it was ridiculous that England should continue to hold out on the subject
of the Low Countries when Austria had herself entered into a private
treaty to abandon them. A passport was therefore demanded, and, somewhat
unfortunately, Lord Malmesbury was again fixed upon as the negotiator.
He went to Lisle, presented his plan of a treaty, and had every reason
to believe that all was going well. England consented to restore all her
conquests with the exception of the Isle of Trinidad, the Cape of Good
Hope, and Ceylon. But this was at the very moment when the quarrel was at
its height in Paris; intent upon its own affairs, the Directory suffered
the negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1198" id="Page_1198">[1198]</a></span>
to drag on, and when at length the republican party won their victory on
the 18th Fructidor, the negotiations were suddenly broken off on the old
ground that Malmesbury had not got full authority. The real reason is
obvious,&mdash;the party in power, who relied on the army, knew that the
power of the army was immensely increased by a state of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Camperdown. Oct. 11, 1797.</div>

<p>The termination of the negotiations was at once followed by a vigorous
continuation of the war. Lord Malmesbury had been but a few weeks in
England when the Dutch fleet found itself ready at length to sail from
the Texel. But the delay&mdash;caused by the weather, the absence of
Hoche, and the factions of Paris&mdash;had almost deprived it of its
terrors. Even when the greater part of his fleet had been in mutiny in
the Thames, Duncan had maintained the appearance of a blockade; keeping
his two faithful ships within sight of the land, he had kept up so
regular a succession of signals, as though sending his orders to a fleet
outside, that the Dutch never found out that there were only two ships
watching them. When at length they sailed Duncan's fleet outnumbered
theirs by one ship. He had withdrawn for an instant to Yarmouth roads
to refit, but apprised in time, he was enabled to fall upon the Dutch
fleet before it had left the coast of Holland. He contrived, although
the enemy was in close order, to come between them and the shore, and
after a close combat, which recalled the old days of the rivalry between
England and Holland, by four o'clock on the 11th of October he had
succeeded in capturing the flagship of Admiral Winter, together with
seven other ships of the line, two 56-gun ships, and two frigates. The
bold man&oelig;uvre of passing between the enemy and the shore was a source
of some danger, as the fleets drifted close inland during the action, but
Duncan skilfully saved both his own fleet and his prizes. The action was
watched by crowds from the Dutch shore. This battle put an end to the
danger of immediate invasion, though it seems to have inspired the French
with a determination to carry on that invasion on a larger scale in the
following year, when great preparations were made under the personal
superintendence of Bonaparte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace of Campo Formio. Oct. 17.</div>

<p>The breach of negotiations at Lisle was followed on the 17th of
October by the completion of the Peace of Campo Formio, which had been
begun by the Preliminaries of Léoben. This peace secured to France the
possession of Belgium, the left bank of the Rhine, and the Ionian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1199" id="Page_1199">[1199]</a></span>
Isles, and acknowledged the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic,
consisting of the provinces conquered in Italy from the Austrians, the
Pope, and Venice; while Austria received in exchange Venice itself and
its eastern provinces, Friuli, Istria, and Dalmatia. France thus lay
not only triumphant in Europe, but with the Rhine for its frontier, and
for outposts four republics pledged to uphold its revolutionary ideas.
But in acquiring this position the rights of peoples had been trampled
upon, Switzerland had been appended to France, the occupation of Rome
had seemed to give colour to the assertion that the Revolution was
atheistical, and the whole turn of events was such as to justify, even to
necessitate, subsequent European interference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Complications attending Irish difficulties.</div>

<p>The peculiar manner in which Ireland has been conquered, peopled, and
managed, renders questions regarding this country most intricate and
difficult. There is seldom a single interest to be traced which is not
crossed by numerous side winds, which render the development of political
questions crooked and complicated. The Roman Catholic interest, the
Protestant interest, the old Irish interest, the Anglo-Irish interest,
the interest of the English ascendancy, the claims of the Presbyterians
as contrasted with the National Church, are constantly crossing and
recrossing. At no time was this complication so great or this difficulty
so insoluble as in the years which followed the breaking out of the
French Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity for the Union.</div>

<p>There is one thing, however, which tends to throw a certain light
upon the conduct of the Government of England during these years of
difficulty. Pitt and his more intimate friends had already firmly
decided in their own minds that one cure only was possible for Irish
evils&mdash;a close and complete legislative union with England. The
action of the Whig Government in 1782 had been ostensibly in exactly the
opposite direction; the triumph of Grattan and the volunteers had been
won when legislative disunion was granted, and what we should now speak
of as Home Rule established. The party which triumphed on that occasion
was not the Irish party, or the Catholic party, but the Protestant
aristocracy. The anti-national character and exclusive nature of the
party in power was shown by the rejection of all Pitt's efforts at
parliamentary reform. The independent Irish Parliament was indeed full of
able speakers; men who carried the art of rhetoric and of clothing little
thought in magnificent language to the highest pitch. But it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1200" id="Page_1200">[1200]</a></span>
unfair to take as a sample of the practical excellence of the management
of what we may speak of as the Home Rulers, the condition of the
Foundling Hospital in Dublin. It was a noble institution; about £16,000
a year was spent on it; 120 noblemen and wealthy gentry were on its
committee; yet after just ten years of Irish management, a committee of
inquiry reported that out of upwards of 2000 infants yearly consigned
to its care, the average that survived was 130. They were sent up in
scores, in open baskets, from distant parts of Ireland, and arrived
crushed and half lifeless, to be tossed aside, without care or inquiry,
into the kennel. Twenty-one committee-men formed a quorum, yet never
once, except when places were to be given away, had that quorum met, and
for years the treasurer, to whom the management had been confided, had
been absolutely bedridden. All that can be alleged in excuse for the bad
management, of which this is a sample, is that the Constitution of 1782
had not been thoroughly tried. Deprived by law of its power in the Irish
Parliament, yet conscious of the impossibility of allowing the country
to act as if completely independent, the Government had had recourse to
indirect influence for establishing its power. While the franchise and
the representation, all official places and all professions, except the
medical profession, were exclusively confined to the Protestants, who
were also the possessors of nineteen-twentieths of the soil, Government
had found it possible by bribery, direct or indirect, to command a
constant majority in Parliament of those who were eager to uphold the
English connection and the Protestant ascendancy. But the very fact of
its thus acting had placed a considerable portion of the Protestant
population in opposition to Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish opposition to Government.</div>

<p>Among the Protestants themselves there were formed two great parties,
who may be called roughly Whigs and Tories; on the one side those
placemen and pensioners who supported the English Government, and on the
other those aristocratic families and connections (probably by no means
purer or higher-minded than their opponents) who wished, as the Whig
aristocracy had wished in England, to be masters of the Government, and
to rule Ireland almost as a separate nation. Of these great connections
the typical men were, of the Tories, the family of the Beresfords, led by
the ability of Fitzgibbon the Chancellor, and of the Whigs, the family of
the Ponsonbys, led by the genius of Grattan. Around the Opposition party
there naturally collected those men who were really reformers at heart,
and the Opposition was thus enabled to use cries and watchwords which
were not only specious and plausible, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1201" id="Page_1201">[1201]</a></span>
which really touched the great evils of the country. The first of these
evils was the preposterous amount of Government influence; and the
obvious way in which that influence might be reached was by a reform of
Parliament, for nothing could be more abominable than the arrangement by
which members were elected. It was worse even than in England; by far
the larger number of seats were either private or Government property,
and nominees were appointed under distinct conditions, and their votes
secured by distinct and well-understood bargains; every man's price and
every man's expectation were actually entered like a list of merchandise
in the Government books. A second point was the fact, that not only all
political power, but till the year 1793 almost all social position was
denied to the Roman Catholics. On the first of these points the opponents
of Government were agreed; they were perfectly willing, for the sake of
injuring Government, to press constantly for a large reform bill. On the
second point there was a far greater difference of opinion. Grattan,
though himself a Protestant and a friend to the Protestant ascendancy,
was great enough to urge constantly the relief of his Catholic
fellow-countrymen; but the great majority of his friends, however much
they might from time to time for political purposes uphold the Catholic
claims, were in fact thoroughly opposed to anything which would injure
their own Protestant ascendancy. There was thus a sort of show of union
between the Protestant nationalists and the Catholics, but at heart
disunion and dislike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grievances of the peasantry.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, whatever effect upon the Protestant population Home
Rule may have had, it had not in the slightest degree alleviated the
position of the Irish peasants. Their landlords were still Englishmen,
Protestants, conquerors, and harsh landlords. The Church of England
still demanded its tithes. The aristocracy and gentry had neglected
their duties till, as has been well said, they forgot they had duties to
perform; they were hopelessly corrupt, both morally and politically. The
independence which the peasantry were taught by the inflated language
used in Parliament to believe they had already acquired seemed to them
a bitter deception; and their belief in the villany of the rulers who
had tricked them, and in the complete slavery and hardship of their own
position as Roman Catholics, was envenomed by the expressions which the
Opposition allowed itself to use in its assaults on Government. They were
thus ripe for rebellion. Indeed, for many years they had been filling
Ireland with outrages. All sorts of combinations had been made against
rent-collectors and tithe-proctors. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1202" id="Page_1202">[1202]</a></span>
Munster arose the Society of the White Boys and the followers of Captain
Right. Combinations were also directed against the farmers of taxes,
who most shamelessly abused their position. Absenteeism was the curse
of Ireland. While the middleman of the absentee landlord racked the
wretched cotter for his rent, the middleman of the absentee parson racked
him for his tithes. They were in the habit of taking their payments in
interest-bearing bonds, and when the wretched peasant was unable to meet
those bonds, he became practically the slave of the tithe farmer, who
compelled him to do his farm work for him as the price of his forbearance
to put the law in execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of the executive.</div>

<p>The executive machinery of the Government in Ireland was not strong
enough to keep order. The outrages of the Catholics had frequently to be
met by the voluntary efforts of their enemies, which soon degenerated
into counter-outrages. Thus there arose in Munster a constant cruel war
between the two religions. In the north of Ireland it was worse, for
the hatred between the religions was there more pronounced. In dread
of outrages similar to those of the south, the Protestants began, in
the roughest and most illegal manner, to deprive the Catholics of arms,
which indeed they had no right to carry; and the Catholics were driven to
form themselves into lawless societies under the name of Defenders, in
opposition to which there arose, about the year 1790, the organization
of the Orange Lodges; and there, too, a cruel civil war began to be
waged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_EFFECT_OF_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION" id="SEVENTEEN_EIGHTYNINE_EFFECT_OF_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION"></a>Effect of the French Revolution in Ireland.</div>

<p>While Ireland was in this miserable condition, while the liberty which
the wretched peasantry had been promised had entirely disappeared, while
the upper classes of all parties seemed in the last degree degraded, and
the ascendancy of the useless and tyrannical Church fixed for ever, the
great news of the French Revolution came. Even in more sober England
men's hearts were stirred within them at the promise of the emancipation
of the human race; among the suffering passionate Irish, with their
impulsive and sanguine dispositions, the effect was far greater. But
the class who were at first chiefly influenced by it were not the Roman
Catholics&mdash;although, no doubt, for them too it seemed to promise at
least a share in the franchise,&mdash;but the Northern Presbyterians and
Dissenters, republican from their origin, and, from the very nature of
their religious creed, equally oppressed with the Catholics by a proud
and dominant Church, and more keenly alive to that abominable system of
government which touched the Protestant more nearly than the Catholic,
because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1203" id="Page_1203">[1203]</a></span>
alone had any share in it. Ulster, and especially the town of Belfast,
were the great centres of the republican and Jacobin feelings, together
with Dublin, where, as was natural, the more lively, ambitious, and
freethinking elements of society were chiefly to be found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties of the Government.</div>

<p>There were thus to be somehow handled and managed by Government a
strong, vicious, reckless, constitutional opposition, in connection with
a few men honestly desiring the legislative independence of Ireland, and,
as a necessary step, thorough parliamentary reform;&mdash;secondly, a
great body of Catholics, of which the higher and more respectable part
desired the gradual alleviation of their position, and joined with the
Opposition, not from dislike to the English connection, but because
the supporters of Government influence seemed inclined to refuse every
demand; and of which the lower part, in wild misery and excitement, was
waging a lawless war both in the north and south;&mdash;and thirdly, a
very considerable body of men, dissenters of the North, and freethinkers
of Dublin, who, touched by the influence of the French Revolution,
desired an entire overthrow of the Government, and were willing to throw
themselves into the arms of France for the destruction of the English
connection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of the Society of United Irishmen.</div>

<p>It is plain that of these sections two were chiefly
dangerous&mdash;the Roman Catholic peasant, who hated the Protestant,
and the republican Protestant, who hated the Government and hated the
Catholic also. While these were separate it might be possible to play
off one against the other. In this the few reckless men who desired
a complete change of Government saw the cause of their weakness.
The most prominent of these was Wolfe Tone, a young barrister, the
son of a Dublin coachmaker, who for personal reasons as he openly
confessed&mdash;because certain suggestions of his had not been well
received in England&mdash;was the determined enemy of everything English.
Nominally a Protestant, really a freethinker, to him, and to several
others like him, religious disputes appeared merely ridiculous; and the
brilliant idea seized him of uniting those two sections of people which
were really dangerous to England&mdash;the Northern Republican and the
National Roman Catholic&mdash;and of thus forming the great Society of
the United Irishmen. It was plain that great difficulties must arise in
realizing such a scheme. Much as the Protestants of Ulster hated England,
they undoubtedly hated Catholics more; much as the Catholics hated
England, undoubtedly they hated Protestants more. Still, it might be the
policy of both parties to bury for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1204" id="Page_1204">[1204]</a></span>
time their great hatred, and to make common cause on that point which
they had in common. Wolfe Tone and his republican friends, entirely
careless of religion, formed an excellent connecting link. It was with
this view that he betook himself to Belfast, to take advantage of a
great celebration to be held there in honour of the anniversary of the
destruction of the Bastille, and there established his Society, as he
seems already to have done in part in Dublin. Its ostensible views as
put forward in the programme were, that the weight of English influence
was so great as to require the cordial union of the people of Ireland
to maintain liberty, that the only constitutional way of opposing that
influence was reform of Parliament, and that no reform was practicable
which did not include Irishmen of every religious persuasion. Tone hoped,
by thus setting prominently forward the advantages which each party was
desirous of gaining, to win the adhesion of both.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYONE_DISUNION_AMONG_THE_CATHOLICS" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYONE_DISUNION_AMONG_THE_CATHOLICS"></a>Disunion among the Catholics.</div>

<p>But the Catholics themselves were not a wholly united body. Unable
to find any more legitimate means of making themselves heard, they had,
since 1782, intrusted their interests to a central committee at Dublin,
consisting of some of the most important nobility and gentry of their
party, as well as of others of a more violent stamp. The temper of the
English Government was such, that fairly friendly relations subsisted
between it and the Bishops and more educated part of the Catholics.
Pitt was himself a friend to the Catholic claims in England. Many of
the restrictions had been already removed from the Catholics in England
and in Scotland, and neither Pitt nor the chief members of his Cabinet
thought it impossible that the emancipation of the Irish should proceed
by the same steps as in England. This feeling was rendered much stronger
by the French Revolution. It seemed impossible that the dogmatic and
highly organized Roman Church should become the champion of disorder and
atheism, and Pitt hoped by attaching them to himself to find in them a
support against the spread of the revolutionary principles which were his
great dread. The Catholics thus became an object of contention to the
extreme parties; on the one side the Nationalists and United Irishmen
sought to win them by holding out hopes of regaining their supremacy by
reform of Parliament, and of a consequent alienation from English policy
which might well involve a complete change in the Act of Settlement, and
the restoration of much property to its old Roman Catholic owners; and on
the other side the English Government attempted to outbid its rivals, and
to attach the Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1205" id="Page_1205">[1205]</a></span>
more closely to the English interests, by granting them immediately a
large measure of relief. As was natural, this auction terminated in a
split among the Catholics themselves. In 1791 a portion of the Committee
sent up very reasonable demands in a petition, signed by upwards of
sixty names. These petitioners represented the moderate and better part
of the Catholics, who would have been willing to accept the legitimate
offers of the English Government; but the majority, inspired by the
revolutionary feelings of the time, and eagerly desirous for the complete
restoration of their position, refused to acknowledge the petition as
their own, and drove the sixty signatories from the Committee. They then
proceeded to play directly into the hands of Wolfe Tone, entering into
close connection with the revolutionary society at Belfast, which they
no doubt intended to use as a cat's-paw only, until they should attain
that complete Catholic ascendancy, which could scarcely fail to result
from a thorough Reform Bill if connected with the removal of religious
disabilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mismanagement of the Government.</div>

<p>It may excite surprise that the Government did not, in the presence
of the very obvious danger which had arisen, and when the country
was full of disturbance, act vigorously in support of the Protestant
ascendancy, or at least confine itself to giving such measures of relief
as would have satisfied the seceders of the Catholic committee. The
Lord Lieutenant, and those who had charge of the government in Ireland,
perpetually urged upon the English Cabinet the necessity of supporting
the English, declaring that the real contest would ultimately be between
the Irish nationalists and the English settlers. But Pitt could not give
up his idea that relief to the Catholics was necessary. He suffered
Richard Burke, a foolish young man, to act apparently in his name, and to
hold out hopes to the more advanced Catholic party. The Cabinet, indeed,
subsequently denied having given him any authority, but as undoubtedly
Pitt had given him a letter of introduction to the Secretary, it was
very hard to prove this disclaimer. Consequently, in the session of
1792, both the Belfast republicans and the Catholic committee sent up
petitions to Parliament of a very strong description. They were both
rejected, and in their place a measure was introduced by Sir Hercules
Langrishe, apparently with the consent of Government, admitting Catholics
to the profession of the law, removing restrictions on their education,
and repealing the Inter-marriage Act. It was only with considerable
difficulty, and by Government influence, that this Bill was passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1206" id="Page_1206">[1206]</a></span>
through the House, for the Protestant feeling in Parliament was very
strong. Langrishe's measure was no doubt a righteous one; but it is a
question whether at the moment concession to the Catholics was wise,
especially when it was purchased by unpopularity among the Protestants.
It seems probable, however, that both now and in his subsequent action,
Pitt was influenced by a detestation of the iniquitous means by which
Ireland was governed. He did not care much about shocking his majority
of pensioners, or weakening English ascendancy, being fully determined
that before long that ascendancy should give place to a wider and less
provincial scheme of Government, produced by a complete union.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased demands of the Catholics.</div>

<p>The effect of the measure at first was, however, certainly not salutary.
Signs of concession on the part of the Government,
and the foolish conduct of Richard Burke, excited
the Catholics of the United Irish party to raise still
higher claims, and to attempt to insist upon them by overawing the
Government. Determined that there should be no mistake as to the
real wishes of their party, the committee contrived to summon a
general convention of Catholics in Dublin, each parish sending up
its representatives. This Parliament met in what was called the
Back Lane, under the presidency of Edward Burne, a well-known
Catholic merchant of extreme views. The members drew up a
petition, demanding the franchise for the Catholics, and sent it direct
to England, attempting thus to overrule their own Irish Government.
At the same time, Tone and Napper Tandy, the leader of the Dublin
malcontents, attempted to arm their threatening counter-parliament
with military power, by raising, in imitation of the old volunteers, a
body whom they called the National Guards. The vigour of Fitzgibbon
nipped this plan in the bud. He issued a proclamation
against the assembling of men in arms, and as though to prove how
much a little vigour would effect, and how easily the movement
might at that time have been suppressed, the muster which should
have taken place the following day was attended by three men only,
of whom Napper Tandy was one. But the petition of the Convention
had been well received in England; the Government there
persisted in overriding the wishes of the Lord Lieutenant, and with
every appearance of having yielded to pressure, in 1793, Major
Hobart, the Chief Secretary, in accordance with instructions from
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_CATHOLIC_RELIEF_BILL_PASSED" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYTHREE_CATHOLIC_RELIEF_BILL_PASSED"></a>Catholic Relief Bill passed. 1793.</span> London,
introduced, and by Government influence forced down the throat of an
unwilling House of Commons, a second Catholic Relief Bill, admitting Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1207" id="Page_1207">[1207]</a></span>
to the grand juries, magistracy, and, finally, to the franchise, at the
same time repealing the Act which prohibited the bearing of arms. The
Government had now gone as far as it intended to go. It had apparently
made its concessions with a bad grace, and to the wrong people. As
Lawrence Parsons, a singularly sensible member of the Irish Parliament,
pointed out, the Bill gave the franchise, but still refused to the
Catholics the right of sitting in Parliament. As the franchise was very
low, it virtually threw the power into the hands of the lower Catholics,
while excluding the Catholic gentry from their legitimate influence. It
was, however, in vain that he urged the admission of the Catholics to
Parliament, and the raising of the franchise. The United Irishmen were
able to say, that as long as they could vote for Protestants alone the
franchise was of little use; and further, that even had they been able
to elect Catholics, the Government influence was too strong to make the
change of any avail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed agitation for reform of Parliament.</div>

<p>It was then nominally with the cry of reform of Parliament that
they continued their agitation. And as the late concessions had been
apparently granted under a system of threats, the same system of
intimidation was pursued. Riots and outrages again broke out in all parts
of Ireland. The Defenders again became active. House after house of the
Protestants was robbed. Murders of all sorts were committed. In this
year alone there were 180 houses attacked in Munster; while the success
of the Convention had been such that the experiment was to be repeated
at Athlone. Fitzgibbon indeed postponed the immediate danger by securing
the passage of the Convention Bill, which forbade the assembling of such
illegal meetings; and in other respects the hands of the executive were
for the time so much strengthened, that although much outrage continued,
and discontent was smouldering throughout the country, and the emissaries
of the United Irishmen scarcely veiled their revolutionary intentions,
their hopes sunk low, and Tone was himself thinking of joining the
Government side. He even had an interview with the Chief Secretary, and
there was some thought of giving him employment abroad. But just about
this time, in 1794, the United Irishmen, losing hope of carrying out
their revolution singlehanded, began to think of summoning the assistance
of France. It was in this year that one Jackson went as an emissary
to France with undoubtedly traitorous designs. One of his comrades,
as so often happens in Irish treasons, turned informer; Jackson was
apprehended, and took poison, and died in the dock as the sentence was
being pronounced on him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_FAILURE_OF_FITZWILLIAMS_EFFORTS" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFOUR_FAILURE_OF_FITZWILLIAMS_EFFORTS"></a>Failure of Fitzwilliam's efforts at reform.</div>

<p>Suddenly the hopes of the Irish party received an unexpected impulse.
In the year 1794 the Duke of Portland and the Whigs joined the Cabinet.
Their point of union was the war only, in other respects they clung to
their old traditions. Portland, their chief, had been Prime Minister
when the Act for legislative equality had been passed; and when,
under pressure from this section of his party, Pitt consented to send
Lord Fitzwilliam, the heir of Lord Rockingham, to Ireland as Viceroy,
there seemed a great probability that a complete change of policy was
intended. Such indeed was the view of Grattan, who had had a personal
interview with Pitt, and such no doubt was Fitzwilliam's own view. Such
in part was Pitt's view also, but he was half-hearted in the matter. He
was displeased at having to yield anything to the new members of his
Cabinet, and though desiring that the Catholic claims should be granted,
he was so pledged to repression that he scarcely thought the present a
desirable time for that measure; while his fidelity to personal friends,
and his strong view of personal claims, made him determined that none
of the existing officers or placemen should be removed. Besides this,
the only statesman of great ability among the Irish, and the only one
who possessed Pitt's ear, was Fitzgibbon the Chancellor, a bigoted
upholder of Protestant ascendancy. It was then with very different
views that Fitzwilliam and Pitt regarded the new appointment. How great
this difference was seems to be absolutely proved by a reference to
Grenville's letters. In fact, the way in which Pitt yielded can only be
explained by his intending ultimately to produce the Union. Fitzwilliam's
arrival was hailed with enthusiasm by the Irish, and acting upon his own
view of his commission, which he believed that Pitt shared, he proceeded
rapidly to introduce reforms. Fitzgibbon, it was clearly understood, he
was not to touch; but the Attorney and the Solicitor-General, Wolfe and
Toler, he removed, and replaced them by the far better known lawyers,
Ponsonby and Curran. A great outcry was raised at this, but it was slight
when compared with the opposition evoked when the Viceroy proceeded to
lay his hands on Mr. Beresford, Commissioner of the Revenue. He was the
head of one of those great families who obtained their influence by
managing the country for the Government interest, without any claim on
the score of talent. So great was his influence that a quarter of the
places in Ireland were said to be his gift, though he himself occupied
only the unimportant situation of Commissioner of the Revenue. Every
underling and jobber in the country felt his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1209" id="Page_1209">[1209]</a></span>
position endangered, but it wanted more influence than theirs to remove
Fitzwilliam. His discomfiture was completed by his own rash rapidity
of action. A Bill was planned with the co-operation of Grattan for
the immediate granting of the Catholic claims. Fitzgibbon at once
took advantage of this, and well acquainted with the obstinacy and
over-scrupulousness of the King's character, found means to have it
suggested to him that to admit Roman Catholics to Parliament was a breach
of his Coronation Oath. The suggestion fell on willing ears; from that
time onward it became a fixed idea in the royal mind, from which no
effort could remove it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_LORD_CAMDEN_SUCCEEDS_FITZWILLIAM" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYFIVE_LORD_CAMDEN_SUCCEEDS_FITZWILLIAM"></a>Fitzwilliam succeeded by Lord Camden.</div>

<p>Fitzwilliam was recalled. Lord Camden, son of Chatham's friend Pratt,
succeeded him as Viceroy, with the avowed intention of restoring the
system of Government and the policy of Lord Westmoreland. His arrival was
marked by riots in Dublin, in which Fitzgibbon's life was with difficulty
saved. Grattan persisted in bringing in the Bill he had begun under Lord
Fitzwilliam, but when, after a debate which lasted all through the night,
it was finally rejected by a large majority, the rejection was held to be
final.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An open rebellion begins.</div>

<p>A change came over the spirit of Ireland, Even the more patriotic
members began to think that a complete separation from England was their
only hope. The Catholic committee, feeling that it was no longer of any
use, dissolved itself. The Catholics made common cause with the United
Irish, and the bolder spirits, scarcely hiding their revolutionary
intentions, sought assistance directly from France, whither Tone and Lord
Edward Fitzgerald betook themselves; and an insurrection was planned,
to be carried out in conjunction with a French army under Hoche. One
effect of this was the separation of the Protestants of the North from
the disaffected body. Among the townsmen of Belfast revolutionary
principles still kept their hold; but the eagerness of the Catholic
Defenders and their constant outrages to procure arms threw the great
mass of the northern Protestants, whether Churchmen or Presbyterians,
on to the Government side. The Orange Lodges were formed and organized.
The opposite parties were divided, as seems inevitable in Ireland, by
religion; and the first open fight between the two parties took place
at the little village of Diamond in Armagh, a skirmish spoken of as
the battle of the Diamond. At all events, interests now began to clear
themselves. The fight was between Catholic revolutionary Irish and the
Protestant upholders of English ascendancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1210" id="Page_1210">[1210]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the rebellion.</div>

<p>This piece of Irish history has been, and will ever be, the subject
of the fiercest controversy. It is only by remembering that on one side
the accumulated wrath of a half-savage and badly governed country was
making itself terribly visible for an object which cannot be condemned,
yet by means which were utterly odious; and that on the other side the
instinct of self-defence, the stern necessity of upholding their rule
at all hazards, fear of the ever-threatening horrors of a triumphant and
savage foe, and revenge for the personal miseries already inflicted upon
them, were driving men to cruel though perhaps necessary actions, that
this period can be read in at all a judicial and unpartisan spirit.</p>

<p>With regard to the savage cruelty of the Irish, it can only be said,
as affording some excuse for their conduct, that they had suffered much,
that they had much to complain of. With regard to the real danger and
lengthened organization of the conspiracy there is abundant proof, and
was then abundant proof in the hands of the Irish Government, for as
usual all the secret committees were full of traitors. With regard to
the conduct of the Government&mdash;which, whatever may be said of it,
did not drive the people to rebellion, for they had long settled upon
that&mdash;it may be fairly asked what other means than severity could
possibly have been used. Lord Camden deserves the greatest credit for his
moderation, and for the care with which, through two years and upwards,
he avoided bringing on an open outbreak. The only real question appears
to be whether severity used much earlier might not have altogether
frustrated the rebellion. The reason why this severity was not used is to
be found in the conduct of the Whigs in England, and in the views of Pitt
and the Liberal part of his Government, who sat apart from the scene and
could not be brought completely to comprehend the danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSIX_DEFENSIVE_MEASURES_OF_GOVERNMENT" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSIX_DEFENSIVE_MEASURES_OF_GOVERNMENT"></a>Defensive measures of the Government.</div>

<p>To the Irish Government the state of the country was well known. It
was known that Wolfe Tone had gone abroad, nominally to America, but
with the intention of visiting France, with the full approbation of
the United Committee at Belfast. It was known that in 1795 the plans
of an insurrection had been almost perfected, and that to meet that
insurrection there were in Ireland scarcely any English troops, about
10,000 invalids and fencibles, and a militia half of whom were among the
conspirators. It was also known that assassinations and the swearing-in
of conspirators were of constant occurrence. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1211" id="Page_1211">[1211]</a></span>
surprising that in the year 1796 it was found necessary to pass an
Indemnity Act to cover acts for the preservation of peace which broke
the letter of the law done by the army and magistrates, or that a Bill
should have been passed against assassination, or that an Insurrection
Act, which allowed suspected districts to be declared beyond the law, and
to be placed in military occupation and deprived of arms, should have
been carried. The danger became still more threatening when it was known
that Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the brother of Lord Leitrim, and Arthur
O'Connor, the friend of all the Whigs in England, had gone abroad, had
seen General Hoche in Switzerland, and arranged with him for a French
invasion. At this time a trustworthy informant told the Government that
there were 200,000 men ready officered, that there were pikes and muskets
for 150,000, and that the militia were almost to a man members of the
United Irish Society. It was then that it became absolutely necessary for
security to raise a trustworthy force. This force, principally consisting
of Protestants, who volunteered immediately to the number of 37,000, was
the yeomanry. It did not, however, consist entirely of Protestants; and
Camden, in spite of the pressure laid upon him by Parliament and by all
who surrounded him, refused to recognize the Orange Lodges, which would
at once have given him the power he wanted. As it was, the establishment
of the yeomanry certainly saved Ireland, and yet it is here probably that
the great error of the Government showed itself. English soldiers, if
possible, alone should have been used. The traditional hatred between the
religions was too fierce to allow the subjugation of the Catholics to be
left in the hands of the Protestant yeomen.</p>

<p>The invasion which Hoche had planned, in accordance with the
wishes of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone, was a very formidable
one; nor, had it succeeded in landing, could it probably
have been otherwise than successful. Fortunately the energy of the
Government had just then struck a most damaging blow at the
<span class="sidenote">Arrest of the revolutionary committee.</span>
insurrectionary movement. Among the other illegal actions of the army of
the North, which had been under the command of Luttrell, Lord Carhampton,
had been the sudden apprehension of the whole revolutionary committee
in Belfast. Neilson, Ore, Russell, and the two Sims, had been lodged in
Dublin Castle. It was to allow of such arrests as these that almost at
the same time the Habeas Corpus was suspended; for the Government was in
the awkward position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1212" id="Page_1212">[1212]</a></span>
knowing the treasonable practices which were going on, and of knowing
the authors of them, but of yet being unable to produce proofs, as the
information had been received under the seal of secrecy. The importance
of this apprehension was much increased by the very complete organization
of the United Society. A series of little societies, none of which
exceeded eighteen, were linked together, and formed a complete hierarchy
through baronial committees, district committees, provincial directories,
up to a grand executive directory of five, elected secretly, and known
to none but the provincial secretaries, who examined the votes. The
military organization was almost as complete. The sudden destruction of
the executive committee, whom nobody knew, in fact cut the head of the
organization entirely away; till what had happened had been discovered,
and a fresh committee elected, there was no power to issue any orders. It
is probably to this that is to be traced, not only the apathy, but the
apparent goodwill of the people of the South at the time of the French
invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of the French expedition to Bantry
Bay.</div>

<p>The period during which the French expedition, thirty-eight ships of
all sorts, was lying in Bantry Bay was one of extreme danger. The strange
inactivity of the English navy would have allowed the French to complete
their plans at perfect leisure. Fortunately Hoche himself had been
separated from the expedition on its passage, and Grouchy, the second in
command, shrank from the responsibility of leading without his superior's
commands. A hurricane swept the bay, preventing landing, and the ships
returned uselessly to Brest. But the apathy of the people was of very
short duration. The evident possibility of assistance from France raised
their temper. The disturbances <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_LAKES_SUCCESS_IN_ULSTER" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_LAKES_SUCCESS_IN_ULSTER"></a>General Lake's
success in Ulster.</span> in the North were speedily renewed; murder
followed murder; Orange retributions followed in their turn, and at last,
in March 1797, General Lake was ordered to disarm the conspirators of
Ulster. He issued a proclamation ordering all persons to bring in their
arms and surrender them, threatening to use force if they were refused.
Well informed by his spies, Lake captured 50,000 muskets, 72 cannon, and
70,000 pikes, often, it must be confessed, with cruel severity on the
part of the yeomanry, who were his agents. Frequently, but it is believed
only when certain information had already been obtained of the existence
of arms, flogging and picketing (that is, putting their feet upon sharp
stakes) wrung from the wretched peasants the knowledge of their place of
concealment. Such conduct, though cruel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1213" id="Page_1213">[1213]</a></span>
had it been exercised throughout Ireland would probably have prevented
the worst of the insurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased difficulties of the Government.</div>

<p>But the Government was hampered in Ireland by a very small, but very
eloquent and noisy, opposition in Parliament, and in England by the whole
of the Whig opposition in and out of Parliament, constantly crying out
against any severity, or any use of other than the civil power; and by
the Cabinet itself, which continued half-hearted, disliked severity,
looking forward ultimately to a complete change of system, and desired,
even by great concessions, to put off an outbreak till that change could
be effected. But it was in fact impossible. The very existence of these
champions for their cause, the secession from Parliament of Grattan
and his friends, who declared that their voices were now useless, the
supposition that the English Cabinet would not tolerate any extreme
measures, the certainty that France was still thinking of assisting them,
the opportunity for that assistance afforded by the mutiny at the Nore,
in which traces of Irish influence are not wanting, drove the leaders
to more and more extreme steps. Still more was their confidence raised
by the ill-judged conduct of Sir Ralph Abercromby, who was appointed
to succeed Carhampton as commander-in-chief. He was the friend of Lord
Moira. An ardent Whig, and full of English Liberal views, and used to
regular English soldiery, he was disgusted both at the stringent measures
and disorderly conduct of the yeomanry he was called upon to command, and
shocked its feelings by declaring that their state of disorganization was
such as to make them a terror to none but themselves. He even declined to
carry on in the South that work which Lake had done in the North, and to
disarm Munster. Again General Lake was called to undertake the unpleasant
duty. It was no doubt carried out there, in the midst of an almost purely
Roman Catholic population, with even more severity, more religious
intolerance, and more cruelty, than in the North. It must be observed,
however, that at the worst these cruelties could have lasted but a month,
for after Lake had held his command about that time the insurrection
broke out. When it did break out the Government was partially prepared
for it, for treachery at last put the whole secret of the conspiracy into
their hands. A certain Mr. Reynolds, a man of small property, had joined
the United Irishmen, but frightened at the extent of their schemes, gave
information that the Leinster delegates would meet in March at the house
of Oliver Bond, one of their chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1214" id="Page_1214">[1214]</a></span>
associates. The whole committee was there seized, together with letters
and papers of the utmost importance. Many arrests of leaders followed,
but Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the chief military leader of the conspiracy,
contrived to escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_OUTBREAK_OF_THE_REBELLION" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_OUTBREAK_OF_THE_REBELLION"></a>Actual outbreak of the insurrection. May 23,
1798.</div>

<p>The 23rd of May had been appointed for a general rising. Two days
before that date Fitzgerald was arrested, after a desperate resistance.
With a dagger he killed one of his assailants, Captain Ryan, and severely
wounded Captain Swan; nor was he secured till Major Sirr, the town mayor,
shot him through the shoulder. He lingered a few days and then died. Two
other leaders, of the name of Sheares, were also arrested, and papers
of a most bloodthirsty nature found about them. In spite of the loss of
their leaders, the insurrection broke out on the appointed day. It was to
have opened with the capture of Dublin. This attempt completely failed;
but on all the roads round the city the mail coaches were destroyed,
so as to isolate the capital; and at Naas, Kilcullen, Rathfarnham, and
Prosperous, and in other places in the county of Kildare, the military
were attacked. At Prosperous the barracks were burnt, and nearly all the
soldiers killed. In most other directions a brief moment of success,
marked by actions of wild savagery, was all that was accomplished.
From Kildare the insurrection turned upon Carlow. But there timely
arrangements were made, and 600 of the rebels perished, while not a
single soldier was hurt. The success of the soldiery was marked by even
worse cruelty than that of the rebels; twenty-eight suspected yeomen
were shot in cold blood in the neighbourhood of Dunlaven; and after the
defeat at Carlow, Gordon says: "Executions commenced, as elsewhere in
this calamitous period, and about 200 in a short time were hanged or
shot according to martial law; among the rest Sir Edward Crosby, a loyal
gentleman, who unfortunately professed Liberal opinions." But it was
where least expected that the rebellion was most formidable. In Kildare
the rebels never gained much head; but in Wexford, which was regarded as
free from disaffection, a regular war arose. The rebels here mastered the
town of Wexford, where they found a gentleman of property, Mr. Bagenal
Harvey, to whom they gave the command. But their real leader was a priest
named Murphy. They succeeded in overrunning the country, but were at
last checked by General Johnson before the town of New Ross. He pursued
them to Enniscorthy, and on the 21st of June General Lake succeeded in
utterly routing the rebels, and taking their camp on Vinegar Hill. This
was practically a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1215" id="Page_1215">[1215]</a></span>
deathblow to the rebellion, though many of its horrors continued in
isolated districts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of Lord Cornwallis to succeed Camden.</div>



<p>Two or three days before this battle was fought a new Lord-Lieutenant
had arrived in Dublin. This was Lord Cornwallis, who had once before
been asked to assume the post, but, frightened at its difficulties,
had withdrawn. The recall of Camden may have been necessary if any
policy of reconciliation was to be tried, for he was no doubt deeply
implicated in the measures of repression which had been taken, and it
would have been hard to have aroused confidence in him in the minds of
the Irish. Certainly, however, a shadow of blame was allowed to rest upon
his conduct which was perfectly unjust. He had been as longsuffering
as it was possible to be. He had even at his sorest pressure rejected
the employment of the Orangemen, from the dread, which he frequently
expresses in his letters, of establishing a religious war, and setting
one part of the people against the other. Self-confidence was the chief
characteristic of Lord Cornwallis. The ministers constantly complain
in their correspondence of the little information he deigned to give
them; and his view and management of the crisis were based entirely
upon his own conception of what had been going on, without consultation
with those who had taken part in it. He brought with him a view in some
respects erroneous, but which seems on the whole to have led him to
right conclusions. He denied that the insurrection was either religious
or national; he considered it Jacobin. The view was, no doubt, entirely
erroneous; yet it induced him to act in the same way that the most
careful and enlightened philanthropist would have acted. For the Jacobin
leaders, the Dublin and Belfast Protestants, he was pitiless; for the
misguided people he had a profound pity. He therefore used all his
efforts to conciliate, and speedily after his arrival, with the advice
of Lord Clare, an amnesty was published for all who would lay down their
arms. It was certainly not the way to put an end most rapidly to the
insurrection. It was mistaken <span class="sidenote">His efforts at conciliation.</span>
for fear, and again and again he found his hopes of conciliating the
Catholics disappointed, the reason being that his hopes were based upon
a wrong ground. But, nevertheless, this course was exactly the most
desirable for England to pursue. It was the conduct of a strong third
person intervening to stop an internecine contest. While the country
was still disturbed, and parties of brigands were scouring all the
out-of-the-way corners (for that was the form the rebellion ultimately
took), the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1216" id="Page_1216">[1216]</a></span>
leaders were hanged in Dublin; till, struck with terror, the prisoners,
seventy in number, offered to say all they knew if their lives were
spared. Anxious to gather from their own lips proofs that would refute
the constant, plausible, and factious assertions of Whigs in England and
Nationalists in Ireland, although the Government knew probably all that
could be told, Cornwallis accepted the offer. Arthur O'Connor, who had
once before been tried in England, and acquitted because nearly every man
of the Whig party had been called as a witness to swear to his character,
drew up the confession. But he drew it up in a way to suit his own fancy.
All the treasons of which the prisoners had been guilty they not only
confessed, but, now that they were safe for their lives, boasted of in
the true braggart Irish spirit. Cornwallis refused to receive such a
confession; but not liking to break his word, he allowed the prisoners to
give personal evidence before a Committee of Lords, and their evidence
was published. Contrary to the wishes of the Home Government, their lives
were spared. How thoroughly bad they must have been is shown by the fact
that the American minister entreated that the United States might be
mentioned as one of the countries to which they should not be allowed to
withdraw; the opinions they declared were so immoral and so dangerous,
that the Republic must decline to receive them. They were therefore
sent to Fort-George, in Scotland, where they remained till the Peace of
Amiens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of General Humbert's expedition.</div>

<p>Before the insurrection was quite completed there was one other
short episode which seems to show how little real vitality there is in
any national effort in Ireland. A small force under General Humbert,
acting probably without orders, landed at Kilala, in Mayo, on the 22nd
of August. With only 800 men, and a considerable number of irregular
rebels, he advanced against Lake, who had an army of 3000 at Castlebar.
These troops, consisting chiefly of disaffected militia, he utterly
defeated; they fled with a speed which gained for the battle the name
of the Castlebar Races. But on advancing further inland, he found the
uselessness of his adventure, and laid down his arms to Lord Cornwallis.
The squadron which was bringing him reinforcements was defeated and
destroyed by Admiral Warren. Of ten ships but one frigate and one brig
escaped. On board of these was Napper Tandy; while among the prisoners
was Wolfe Tone, the man of most ability among the chiefs. He was tried
and condemned to be hanged, but committed suicide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proved necessity for the Union.</div>

<p>Cornwallis' experience, although it did not diminish his self-confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1217" id="Page_1217">[1217]</a></span>
seemed to force on him one fact, the necessity of the Union. He detested
the Castle party by whom he was surrounded, he believed in the thorough
bloodthirstiness of the Orangemen, he had learnt that conciliation,
unless very complete, could have no effect upon the Catholics. He thus
arrived at the fact of which Pitt had always been conscious, that under
the existing system justice to the Catholics was absolutely impossible;
it was impossible to make the Protestant Parliament agree to admit
Catholic representatives; and even supposing this to be possible,
Catholic representation meant confiscation of Protestant property, and
the predominance of the Catholic religion, and rather than submit to
that the Protestants would fight. To attempt to make such alterations
was wilfully to plunge Ireland into a civil war of extermination. The
only way to overcome this difficulty was to establish some paramount
authority which should overrule the local and provincial interests of
the island, and by a superior power keep the factions from flying at
each other's throats. Cornwallis therefore threw himself heart and soul
into the Union, supported by Fitzgibbon, now Lord Clare. But it was not
carried out without extreme difficulties. Pitt's intention was notified
to the Irish Parliament. Here it at once excited a violent agitation, and
a thing unheard of in that venal House of Commons, an amendment on the
Address, was carried against the Government by a majority of four. Nearly
all the great names in Ireland, from Mr. Foster the Speaker, to Ponsonby,
Grattan, and <span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYNINE_OPPOSITION_TO_THE_UNION" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYNINE_OPPOSITION_TO_THE_UNION"></a>Opposition in the Irish party.</span>
Curran, were strongly opposed to the Bill. As there was no constitutional
way of destroying the Parliament except with its own consent, and as left
to itself it seemed plain that Parliament would oppose the Union, means
had to be devised to change this state of things. The English supremacy
had been systematically upheld by indirect bribery; and when application
was made to the same class of people as had hitherto managed that
influence, their answers showed that it would not be impossible to carry
the same system further. The management of the greater people was left in
the hands of Lord Cornwallis, who had a profound contempt for nearly all
the Irish except the better part of the Roman Catholics. The whole mass
of smaller men was handed over to the management of Lord Castlereagh,
a young Irishman of much ready ability, at that time Secretary. To him
too was intrusted the duty of arranging a scheme which might be passed
through Parliament. By this scheme a million and a half of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1218" id="Page_1218">[1218]</a></span>
was to be spent in compensation to borough-holders, lawyers who
had hoped to improve their prospects by entering the House, and
the tradesmen of Dublin. Pitt had in one of his old reform Bills
accepted the theory that boroughs were property; this part of the
scheme was therefore passed, the indirect claims were not allowed.
The bulk of the Catholic party, to whom hopes were held out, were
not disinclined to the Union. In the English Parliament resolutions
in favour of the Union were carried without much difficulty. The
full force of Pitt's arguments was there felt. It was understood in
fact to be a case of necessity. An independent dual Government
could not be worked, nor justice be secured for Ireland, while party
and religious differences ran so high, except by the intervention of
the calmer and broader spirit of an Imperial Parliament. In the
Irish Parliament the opposition was much stronger. But that none
may feel much regret at the threatened destruction of that body, it
may be mentioned that even now, in its last struggle, it extended the
Act of Indemnity so as to throw a shield over the most outrageous
cruelty and wickedness on the part of the Protestant suppressors of
the rebellion. Fitzgerald, who boasted of having flogged many
perfectly innocent people, and of having driven one at least to
suicide, was not only acquitted when charges of this description
were brought against him, but succeeded in turning the tables and
recovering damages from his victims.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The interval between the
Parliament of 1799 and the Session opening in 1800, which the
Government had determined should be the last, was employed in
continuing the trade in votes and boroughs. The Marquis of Downshire,
who had seven seats of his own, was the only great borough
proprietor who held out. And when the new Parliament met the
Government was pretty secure of its victory. Nevertheless, there
was a tremendous contest on the first night, when an amendment
was moved to the Address, pledging the House to uphold the National
Parliament. For fifteen hours the struggle had lasted, when,
at seven in the morning, Grattan, who had not sat in the House
for some years, was suddenly introduced, just dragged from his bed
and very ill, clothed in the old patriotic dress of the volunteers of
1782, and walked up to the table to take the oaths. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1219" id="Page_1219">[1219]</a></span>
hurriedly elected immediately after midnight for the town of Wicklow
for the express purpose of producing this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de théâtre</i>. His
speech against the Union was a very fine one, but it did not save the
amendment, which was defeated by a majority of forty-two. The Opposition
was now bidding high for votes. £4000 was declared by Lord Cornwallis to
have been offered for one vote. It is uncertain to what extent indirect
bribery had been carried; it was probably <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_THE_UNION_COMPLETED" id="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_THE_UNION_COMPLETED"></a>The
Union completed. Aug. 2, 1800.</span> much exaggerated; but at all
events, when on the 18th of February the resolutions for the Union
were brought in, they were passed by a majority of forty-six. These
resolutions were transmitted to England, and the royal assent was given
to the Bill founded on them on the 2nd of August. By this Bill four
spiritual and twenty-eight temporal peers represented Ireland in the
Upper House, and one hundred commoners, elected still by the old system,
sat in the House of Commons. Free trade between the two countries was
established. Ireland was to contribute in the proportion of two to
fifteen to the Imperial revenue, and the debts of the two countries were
to be kept distinct. Having gained its object, the Government had to pay
the Bill. £1,260,000 was contributed at the rate of £7000 a seat. In
addition to this, twenty-two peerages were created, five Irish peers were
called to the House of Lords, twenty advanced a step in the Peerage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_DESIRE_OF_FRANCE" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYSEVEN_DESIRE_OF_FRANCE"></a>Desire of France to invade England.</div>

<p>By the treaty of Campo Formio the French were relieved from their war
with Austria, and it was probably the belief that singlehanded they were
more than a match for England, the object of their particular hatred,
which induced the Directory to break off the negotiations at Lisle.
The victorious army of Italy was transformed into the army of England.
The prospect of wealth to be gained there was held out to the troops,
instead of the promised donation which the finances were in no position
to bear. The command of the army was entrusted to Bonaparte, who assumed
an appearance of great interest in the expedition, and visited the
sea-coasts under pretense of arranging for the embarkation of the troops;
but he was not likely to risk his fortunes in England while the sea was
commanded by his enemies. He persuaded the Directory that a more severe
blow could be dealt upon England by a descent upon Egypt, the highroad to
India, whence succor could be sent to Tippoo Sahib, the Sultan of Mysore,
who, after he had been crushed by Lord Cornwallis, was again, relying for
success upon French arms, thinking of renewing war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1220" id="Page_1220">[1220]</a></span>
To Bonaparte private ambition was no doubt a main reason for this
resolution. The state of Europe was very threatening. A second coalition
was getting itself formed. In none of the new republics, neither Holland,
nor Switzerland, nor Rome, in all of which constitutions had been forced
on the people against their will, was there a cordial love for France.
But Bonaparte, who, as he said, did not consider "the pear ripe," was
willing that the bad management and failures of the Directory should
ripen it before he raised his hands to pluck it. His imagination too,
which always played a powerful part in his resolutions, was fired with
the notion of an Eastern empire, whence, as he said, he should return and
take Europe <i>en revers</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_NAPOLEONS_CAMPAIGN_IN_EGYPT" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYEIGHT_NAPOLEONS_CAMPAIGN_IN_EGYPT"></a>Bonaparte's campaign in Egypt.</div>

<p>On the 19th of May 1798, the army of France, 36,000 strong, sailed
from Toulon harbour, escorted by 30 vessels of war, 72 smaller vessels,
and carried in 400 transports. The expedition was a strange one; not only
was Egypt to be conquered, it was to be scientifically explored, and a
number of learned and scientific men were mixed with the generals that
surrounded their commander. Before reaching Egypt a strong point was
secured to give the French the command of the Mediterranean. The Order
of St. John of Malta, by treason and for money, gave up the island to
Bonaparte. Thence he sailed on the 2nd of July, and ten days afterwards
reached Alexandria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of the Pyramids.</div>

<p>Thence he marched towards Cairo, which he conquered, after winning
on the road the battle of the Pyramids over the Mamelukes, a warrior
caste sprung originally from Circassian slaves, who had made themselves
masters of Egypt. It was the old story of undisciplined valour breaking
itself against the firm squares of a disciplined Western army. Murad Bey,
the Mameluk commander, withdrew to Upper Egypt, and the French entered
Cairo. Bonaparte at once set to work to organize the country, and in
his eagerness to conciliate the people, hinted that he too believed in
Mahomet. The absolute atheism, however, of the French troops, and this
cynical readiness to change his creed, only exasperated the Turks against
him.</p>

<p>Nelson had been watching the port of Toulon, but the French
fleet gave him the slip. From the 19th of May till the 1st of August
he was in vain pursuit, not knowing where the expedition had gone.
<span class="sidenote">Battle of the Nile. Aug. 2, 1798.</span> On that
day he came in sight of the French fleet, consisting of thirteen ships
of the line, one of which was the 'Orient,' with 120 guns, and four
frigates. Nelson's own fleet consisted also of thirteen ships, but none
of them were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1221" id="Page_1221">[1221]</a></span>
larger than seventy-fours, and he had but one frigate and a brig. The
enemy were very advantageously placed at anchor along the shore of the
Bay of Aboukir. In front of them lay an island with a fort, their flanks
were covered by gunboats. They believed their position unassailable. But
Nelson quickly determined, from the appearance of the anchored fleet,
that there must be sufficient water for his ships between the French and
the shore. He boldly ordered some of his vessels to sail inside. The
left of the French line was thus enveloped and placed between two fires.
Nelson began the fight at once, although it was six in the evening. It
raged the whole night. In less than two hours, however, five of the
French ships had struck, and at nine o'clock the 'Orient' caught fire
and blew up. When the battle closed about six the following morning,
nine of the French ships had been taken and two had been burnt. Want of
frigates, and the damages sustained by his own fleet, prevented Nelson
from pursuing the two remaining French ships, which sailed away almost
unhurt. The same causes prevented him from destroying completely the
French transports. This victory shut up the best French army with its
great commander useless in Egypt, and excited the enthusiasm and hopes of
all the conquered countries in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt forms a second coalition.</div>

<p>But meanwhile Pitt had been able to set on foot a second great
coalition. Austria, humiliated by the Treaty of Campo Formio, far from
discharging her army, had raised its numbers, and demanded some sort of
indemnity for the successes of France in Italy and Switzerland. Napoleon
by his advance upon Egypt had himself forced the Ottoman Empire into
war with France. The princes of Germany, though not desiring war, and
even now treating with the Directory at Rastadt, could not forget the
loss of the empire beyond the Rhine. Russia was also induced to join the
coalition; for changes had taken place both in the internal and external
condition of the country; since 1796, Paul I., a prince of scarcely
sound mind, had succeeded Catherine in that country, and Poland having
been destroyed, a road was open for him to introduce himself, as had
been the constant desire of the Russian monarchs, into the politics of
Europe. Prussia, where Frederick William had died, still held aloof in
neutrality. The cement of this coalition was as usual English money.
Naples, in the winter of 1798, had raised an army under the Austrian
General Mack, and attempted to restore liberty to Italy; but, hated by
its own subjects, the weak and tyrannical government was able to effect
nothing. The King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1222" id="Page_1222">[1222]</a></span>
had to fly in the English fleet, Naples was changed into the Parthenopæan
Republic, and the whole of Italy was thus brought under French dominion.
The frontier line, then, against which the coalition was preparing to
act, extended from the Zuyder Zee to the Mediterranean. Its centre was
the mountain mass of Switzerland. Both parties regarded this as the key
of the position. But the French spread their troops weakly along the
whole length, so that Massena in Switzerland seemed to form the centre
of one large army; and to him was intrusted the duty of separating,
by capturing the salient angle formed by Switzerland and the Tyrol,
the armies of the coalition. The plan was not a wise one. The opening
successes of Massena and his lieutenants, which brought the French
into the valley of the Inn, did not prevent the Archduke Charles from
defeating Jourdan and the army of the Rhine at Stockach, nor Kray, the
Austrian general, from beating Schérer at Magnano, on the Adige, and
driving him behind the Adda. Massena, with his flanks thus exposed, found
himself compelled to retreat also.</p>

<p>These successes on the part of the allies, and the murder of the
French envoys to the Congress of Rastadt, excited the French to fresh
energy. Schérer was replaced by Moreau. Macdonald, who was
holding Naples, hastened to his assistance, and all the armies in
<span class="sidenote"><a name="SEVENTEEN_NINETYNINE_ITALY_REGAINED" id="SEVENTEEN_NINETYNINE_ITALY_REGAINED"></a>Italy regained by the coalition.</span> the centre
were placed in Massena's hands. But Suwarrow, a semi-barbarian, who had
never yet been conquered, had arrived to take the command in Italy.
He pressed on with great rapidity and success. Moreau was beaten at
Cassano (April 27), and fell back behind the Po. He again retired in the
direction of Genoa in order to form a junction with Macdonald coming from
Naples. Suwarrow was thus able to leave him behind him and threaten the
French frontier; the advance of Macdonald however across the Apennines
obliged him to turn. He fell upon that general, and after a three days'
battle upon the Trebia, beat him, and turned rapidly upon Moreau, who
had advanced to Novi, and had there formed a junction with the broken
army of Naples. But both Macdonald and Moreau, as unsuccessful generals,
were removed, and Joubert was given the command. On the 18th of August,
Suwarrow attacked the French at Novi, Joubert was killed, and his troops
completely routed. Italy was thus lost to the French; for in Naples
Cardinal Ruffo had raised the Calabrians, and with the assistance of the
English fleet both Naples and Rome were regained to the coalition. It was
on this occasion that Nelson committed that act which is the great blot
upon his name. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1223" id="Page_1223">[1223]</a></span>
had become infatuated with Lady Hamilton, wife of the English minister,
through whose influence his fleet had been provisioned before the
battle of the Nile, and who was devoted heart and soul to the execrable
Government of the Bourbons, exercised practically by the Queen, a sister
of Marie Antoinette. To please the Court, Nelson, who arrived at Naples
just as the French and Republicans had completed a capitulation with
Cardinal Ruffo, broke off the completed negotiation, and insisted upon
the Republicans capitulating without terms. They were thus handed over
to the cruel vengeance of the Court. 30,000 patriots were thrown into
prison, and for six months all those who had taken the least part in
establishing the Republic were continually exposed to the danger of
execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The coalition captures the Dutch fleet.</div>

<p>The disasters of the French were to have been completed by a combined
attack of English and Russians upon the other extremity of their line.
On the 22nd of August, a few days after the battle of Novi, the Duke
of York, with 30,000 men, disembarked at the Helder, to advance upon
Amsterdam. The defence of the country was intrusted to Brune, but the
allies succeeded in landing, and captured the whole Dutch fleet in the
Texel. At this moment the hopes of the allies were very high, and the
French, worsted abroad and full of discontent at home, seemed on the
verge of destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon defeated at Acre. May 21, 1799.</div>

<p>The news that Bonaparte had been defeated at Acre added still
further to their depression. To complete his dreams of Eastern conquest,
and to forestall the attacks of an army gathering on that side, Bonaparte
had marched into Syria. He won the battle of El Arish, took Joppa, where
he massacred his prisoners, and advanced as far as Acre at the foot of
Mount Carmel. The fortress, which was held by Djezzar, lately a robber,
now a Pacha, was not in itself strong, but the French operations were
rendered slow by the fortunate capture of their battering train by Sir
Sidney Smith, the English commodore. After fifty days a breach was
made, but the brilliant example of Sir Sidney Smith and his sailors,
who entered the town, encouraged the Turkish garrison to a desperate
resistance, which rendered all efforts at assault vain; Bonaparte had to
retreat disappointed. "Had it not been for Djezzar," he said, "I might
have been Emperor of the East." His retreat was marked by another act of
cruelty; he ordered his sick at Joppa to be poisoned. With a broken army
he regained Egypt, but he was still in a condition to beat the Turks near
Alexandria, at what the French call the battle of Aboukir; but while thus
victorious, he heard news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1224" id="Page_1224">[1224]</a></span>
affairs in Europe which led him to think that the pear was at
length ripened. He slipped secretly from his army, accompanied
by his four friends, Berthier, Lannes, Murat, and Marmont, and set
sail for France, leaving the army under the command of Kleber.</p>

<p>Before Napoleon arrived the danger of France from without had
disappeared. Jealousy had arisen between the Austrians and the
Russians, which was not likely to be soothed by the rough behaviour
<span class="sidenote">Jealousies and disasters of the coalition.</span>
of Suwarrow or the palpable self-seeking of the Court of Vienna. It
became necessary to rearrange the commands. The war in Switzerland was
to be intrusted to Suwarrow, who was to march thither and effect a
junction with his Lieutenant Korsakoff, who was already in the country.
But before the junction could be effected Massena annihilated the army
of Korsakoff at the battle of Zurich (Sept. 26), and when Suwarrow had
forced his way over the St. Gotthard Pass, he found himself in the midst
of hostile armies instead of meeting his friends. He turned suddenly
to the right, and making an extraordinary march among the glaciers and
peaks of the Alps, he succeeded in reaching Coire in safety. Believing
himself betrayed by the Austrians, he refused to serve again, and retired
to Russia, where he died in disgrace. Nor had the Duke of York been
more successful in Holland. The character of the country rendered it
very difficult to advance, while the want of discipline of the Russians
on the right wing entailed a defeat before Bergen. The town was indeed
afterwards taken, but loss in battle and by ill health, and the want
of all signs of co-operation on the part of the inhabitants, induced
the English to sign what must be considered a disgraceful convention
at Erckmar, by which they agreed to withdraw from Holland, and give
over 10,000 French prisoners without exchange; the English however kept
possession of the Dutch fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Success in India against Tippoo Sahib and the
French.</div>

<p>In India the English arms had been more successful. The intrigues
of Tippoo with the French having been clearly discovered, and efforts
at friendly arrangement having proved vain, General Harris, with
a considerable army, was ordered in February 1799 to march upon
Seringapatam. The Governor-General at this time was Lord Mornington,
brother of the Duke of Wellington, who himself, as Colonel Arthur
Wellesley, was one of the leaders of the expedition. After two successful
skirmishes, General Harris appeared before the capital, which was a
strong city well prepared for a siege. In about a month the place was
taken by assault and Tippoo himself killed. This success placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1225" id="Page_1225">[1225]</a></span>
the whole kingdom of Mysore, with a large amount of treasure, in the
hands of the conquerors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon returns, and is made First Consul. Nov.
11, 1799.</div>

<p>On his return to Paris (Oct. 16), therefore, Bonaparte found himself
in a position to carry out his plans for personal aggrandizement; and
though the great danger from foreign enemies had disappeared, the
interior of France offered him every opportunity for laying hands
on the Government. It was not forgotten that during his absence the
safety of the Republic had been risked, and its hard-won victories
rendered useless; and as the incapacity of their present rulers had
been even more obvious at home than abroad, all eyes turned to him as
the natural saviour of the State. Moreover, now that the first fervour
of revolutionary energy had worn itself out, the bulk of the nation
desired order, even though earned at the expense of liberty. Of the two
Councils that of the Ancients was decidedly inclined in favour of a more
settled Government, and it was through it that Napoleon determined to
work. The Council of Five Hundred was more difficult to deal with. For
a moment Napoleon shrunk before their patriotic and republican cries,
but, urged by the Abbé Sièyes, who pressed him to action, crying, "They
have put you outside the law, do you put them outside their hall," he
recovered courage, and his Grenadiers, entering the hall with beating
drums, quietly extruded the representatives. Thus was accomplished the
great <i>coup d'état</i> of the 18th Brumaire (Nov. 9). The Directory was
destroyed; a new constitution, spoken of as the Constitution of the year
8, was established, by which the executive power was vested nominally
in three consuls, but really in the First Consul, Bonaparte, who thus
became practically Dictator. His measures were anti-revolutionary, his
object being to restore confidence and to heal faction. With his thoughts
thus turned to the reorganization of France, he desired to be free for
the present from foreign wars, and one of his earliest steps was to make
overtures with the continental powers. To England he made proposals of
peace in a letter addressed immediately to the King (Dec. 25). This was
of course a grave breach of the etiquette of courts, and the letter was
answered by Grenville in anything but a conciliatory spirit, while the
whole blame of the war was thrown upon the French, with whom the English
minister declined to enter into negotiations so long as the Government
was in the hands of those "whom the Revolution had so recently placed in
the exercise of power." Some more correspondence ensued, but the English
ministers positively refused to treat. It is certain that Napoleon's
offer was merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1226" id="Page_1226">[1226]</a></span>
gain time; on the other hand, the dictatorial tone of Grenville's
reply could not but be very irritating to the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_NAPOLEONS_VICTORIES_IN_ITALY" id="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_NAPOLEONS_VICTORIES_IN_ITALY"></a>Napoleon regains the North of Italy.</div>

<p>The weary war therefore continued, and before the year was over the
position of affairs abroad had so changed that England was no longer
able to maintain the haughty tone which had been adopted. War in the
hands of Bonaparte was a very different thing from war in the hands of
the Directory. In April the French were again across the Rhine, and
the Austrians driven behind the Inn; while in Italy, though Genoa, the
last town in the possession of the French, surrendered, its danger
was turned to immediate advantage by Bonaparte. Under pretence
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon's victories.</span> of collecting an
army for its relief, he massed his troops in the neighbourhood of Dijon,
and while all eyes were directed towards the siege, he suddenly pushed
across the Great St. Bernard and appeared at Ivrea on the rear of the
besieging army. Melas, who commanded the Austrians, at length perceived
his danger. He ordered Otto, his lieutenant, to raise the siege, with
the intention of concentrating his troops; his orders were disregarded,
and Genoa was taken, but the delay was fatal. It gave time for Bonaparte
to re-establish the Cisalpine Republic, and, turning backwards, to place
himself between Melas and Mantua, whither that general was now anxious
to withdraw. A decisive battle was brought on before Alessandria, from
which stronghold the Austrians advanced, on the 14th of June, against
the French on the plains of Marengo. The Austrians, more numerous than
the French, had apparently won the battle, and by three o'clock the
whole French army had retreated. Melas withdrew to rest, leaving what he
believed to be a pursuit in the hands of General Zach; but the French
army, reinforced by the reserves, and headed by Desaix, made a great
final effort. The Austrians, who had advanced too rashly in the eagerness
of their pursuit, were unable to withstand his charge; they broke, and
their victory was changed into a disastrous defeat. On the following
day, with the victorious army in his front, and the liberated garrison
of Genoa in his rear, the Austrian general, seeing no hope, entered into
a convention, called the Convention of Alessandria, by which the greater
part of North Italy was surrendered to the French.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to change this Convention into a more
general peace, and a Congress was held for this purpose at Lunéville,
but the English Cabinet was much divided in its own views,
the Austrian Government acted with extreme duplicity, and Napoleon
demanded a separate treaty with the two belligerent powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1227" id="Page_1227">[1227]</a></span>
which Austria, knowing its weakness when separate from England,
was afraid to grant. The Congress came to nothing, and in November
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Hohenlinden. Dec. 2, 1800.</span> the
army under Moreau renewed the campaign. The Austrians were determined
to hold the line of the Inn, but their troops, very badly commanded
by Archduke John, were attacked in the forest of Hohenlinden, and
sustained a crushing defeat. Their loss is put at 25,000 men and 100
guns. There could no longer be any question in the matter, and
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_ONE_TREATY_OF_LUNEVILLE" id="EIGHTEEN_ONE_TREATY_OF_LUNEVILLE"></a>Treaty of Lunéville. Feb. 9, 1801.</span> the
Emperor had no choice, if he would save his capital, but to sue for a
separate peace. By the Treaty of Lunéville (Feb. 9, 1801) the frontier of
the Rhine was again ceded to France.</p>

<p>It needed but a breach with Russia to leave England singlehanded
in opposition to France. The Emperor Paul, but little
removed from madness, had seen with disgust the defeat of his troops
in Switzerland, and believed that in the joint expedition to Holland
his army had been wilfully sacrificed. He was also smitten with
<span class="sidenote">Russia deserts the coalition.</span> extreme
admiration for the genius of Bonaparte, who took care to flatter this
feeling and to intrigue against English influence. The old question
of the right of search gave Paul a pretext to break with his allies.
The doctrine of the English, accepted generally as the law of nations,
was that a belligerent had the right of searching neutral ships for
contraband of war or for property of the enemy. The Northern powers
claimed that the neutral flag should cover the cargo, with the exception
of contraband of war. This had been their view for many years, and, as
has been mentioned, gave rise to the Armed Neutrality of 1780.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
This view they had not been able to enforce, but it was quite an
open question whether ships under convoy of a man-of-war could be
searched. On this point the English and the Danes twice came into
collision; but during the summer of 1800 an amicable arrangement
had been arrived at. Paul however refused to let the matter drop;
he took it up as an injury to the whole Northern powers, laid an
embargo upon all English property in Russia, made prisoners 300
merchant seamen, and renewed the Armed Neutrality, which was
joined willingly by Sweden, and under pressure by Denmark also.
The English Government at once retaliated by an embargo on the property
of the allied nations; and England was thus left completely
singlehanded, for her allies in the south of Europe were much too
weak to afford her any assistance, while her maritime superiority
seemed seriously compromised by the action of the Baltic powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1228" id="Page_1228">[1228]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_INTERNAL_CONDITION_OF_ENGLAND" id="EIGHTEEN_HUNDRED_INTERNAL_CONDITION_OF_ENGLAND"></a>Internal condition of England.</div>

<p>Nor was it only abroad that danger seemed impending. The condition
of the country was rendered miserable both by heavy taxes and by the
pressure of two years of scarcity. Corn had risen to the unprecedented
price of 120 shillings the quarter, a price which could not possibly
have been maintained under any reasonable system of political economy.
But at this time it was held in the last degree dangerous to admit corn
from abroad, partly because it was thought that a nation should trust to
its own resources for the prime necessaries of life, partly because it
was believed that a diminution of gold and silver, which must inevitably
follow from large importations, was a disastrous thing for the nation.
Nor was this all, the arrangements of the poor law were such that it
became necessary to maintain high prices in the agricultural districts.
The received opinion was that the increase of population, irrespective
of the powers of employing it, was a distinct advantage. Premiums
were given for early marriages, and assistance granted from the rates
in proportion to the numbers in a family. The natural tendency was a
fearful increase of population, depending for the most part on the rates,
which were therefore inordinately high. It thus became possible for the
farmers to pursue the plan they have always regarded as most conducive
to their interests, and to drive down the wages to the lowest point; the
people were reduced to a condition little above serfdom; and to enable
the agricultural districts to support the pressure of the rates high
prices had to be maintained. The condition of the country districts was
thus kept tolerably even, and the burden of the high prices fell almost
exclusively upon the industrious population of the towns. It was natural
that a House of Commons returned chiefly by the landowners should favour
protective duties, which thus rendered them at once absolute masters
of their peasantry and threw the burden of their increased expenditure
upon the towns. But such a state of things produced much suffering, and
suffering produced riots, which the folly and ignorance of the judges
increased. From the Lord Chief Justice downwards, they seemed to have
combined to throw the blame upon the corn factors, whom they charged with
the obsolete crimes of forestalling and engrossing. Punishment was indeed
inflicted for the crime of buying corn and selling it at a higher price
in the same market. The people naturally took their cue from these blind
leaders, and corn riots were very prevalent. It is of course plain that
whatever tends to the husbanding of resources and to the equalization of
prices is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1229" id="Page_1229">[1229]</a></span>
really advantageous, and that the corn factors, in carrying out the law
of supply and demand, were a most useful set of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Autumn session. Oct. 1800.</div>

<p>To meet these difficulties Pitt thought it expedient to have an
autumn session. He was himself inclined to think that some extraordinary
measures were desirable to alleviate the distress, and in the existing
state of the law he was perhaps right. But Grenville, a more rigid
follower of the principles of political economy, was much opposed to any
tampering with the natural laws of supply and demand.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
When Parliament met the action of the judges was gravely censured,
and several remedial measures were introduced, such as bounties on
importation of grain, and the prohibition of the use of corn in
distilling and starch making, and (though this proved a useless
and pernicious measure) of the use of any but brown bread. Large
subscriptions were also made to alleviate the distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_ONE_REJECTION_OF_THE_RELIEF_BILL" id="EIGHTEEN_ONE_REJECTION_OF_THE_RELIEF_BILL"></a>Pitt proposes a Catholic Relief Bill. 1801.</div>

<p>The Parliament which assembled early the following year (1801)
was the first united Parliament of Great Britain and
Ireland, and but a few days of its existence had elapsed
before a great and most unexpected change took place
in the position of affairs. There had long been a want of harmony
among the members of the Cabinet with regard to the war; but
there had now arisen an even more formidable question. The union
had been effected by much bribery in money, titles, and places;
these promises had all been fulfilled. But there was one section of
the Irish whose opposition would have been fatal to the measure,
but to which such promises could not be made. The tacit support,
or at all events neutrality, of the Irish Roman Catholics had been
secured by a vague but very well-understood promise that their
claims should be considered under the new arrangement. It is
certain that both Castlereagh and Cornwallis understood that this
was so, and Pitt felt it an imperative duty to make an effort to fulfil
this promise. The matter had been talked over in the Cabinet as
early as the autumn of 1799, and was formally discussed in the
presence of Lord Castlereagh at the end of September 1800. The
Chancellor, Lord Loughborough, was at that time in attendance upon
the King at Weymouth. He was a man of a base and time-serving
nature. At this Cabinet he displayed his hostility to any measure
for the relief of the Catholics, and used his opportunity to instill into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1230" id="Page_1230">[1230]</a></span>
the King's mind that to consent to any such measure would be a
breach of his coronation oath. In this he was backed up by Lord
Auckland, who had always been a friend of Pitt's, but who was inclined
to underhand intrigue, and did not think it beneath him to
prejudice the King's mind against Pitt's policy. Matters were brought
to a crisis when, at a levée in the beginning of 1801, the King mentioned
openly to Dundas that he was aware that such a measure was
in contemplation, adding his usual formula, that he "should hold
any one who supported it as his personal enemy." It became plain
to Pitt that he could hesitate no longer, and although the King sent
Addington the Speaker, a personal friend of Pitt's, to persuade him not
to bring the matter forward, he sent a letter to George declaring his intention
and his determination to resign if he was not allowed to fulfil
<span class="sidenote">Pitt resigns. Addington Prime Minister. 1801.</span>
his promises to the Irish. The King wrote back urging him to remain in
office and to drop the measure, but Pitt was determined, and the King was
forced to accept his resignation. In his place he desired Addington, a
man of very second-rate ability, to form a ministry, a duty which, on the
advice of Pitt, he accepted. The resignation of the great minister, as it
was only personal, did not imply the resignation of the whole ministry,
but all the great members of it, Grenville, Dundas, Windham, and Spencer,
retired with him. It is pleasant to think that Lord Loughborough's
duplicity received no reward, he was excluded from the new arrangements,
Lord Eldon, at the King's own request, became Lord Chancellor, and
Loughborough had to content himself with the earldom of Rosslyn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illness of the King.</div>

<p>The shock of parting with a minister he had so long trusted brought on
a renewal of the King's insanity, and measures were taken for a regency
under the same restrictions that Pitt had before insisted upon. George
was at this time so popular that even the Opposition treated him in his
illness with every consideration. His popularity, the natural consequence
of his well-ordered domestic life, had been considerably increased by
an attempt in the preceding year on his life. When entering Drury Lane
Theatre a man had risen in the pit and discharged a pistol at him, two
bullets passing a very little above his head. The miscreant who made
the attempt was a lunatic of the name of Hadfield. The King, always
remarkable for his personal courage, had displayed great calmness under
the circumstances, and the loyalty of the nation had been much excited.
Fortunately, under Dr. Willis's treatment, his illness was speedily
mastered, and in the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1231" id="Page_1231">[1231]</a></span>
March he was declared convalescent. But his illness, which he himself
traced to Pitt's conduct, had such an effect upon that statesman,
that he wrote promising never to reintroduce the Catholic question.
His friends did not see why, under these circumstances, he should not
remain in office, but Addington naturally objected to giving up the
place he had just gained, and the Government continued in his hands,
<span class="sidenote">Character of the Addington ministry.</span>
supported by a Cabinet of complete mediocrity, upheld for the present
by Pitt's influence. It was indeed just such a minister and Cabinet as
suited the King's well-known views&mdash;safe, conservative, submissive,
and without commanding ability. Nor did the great country party object
to a change which freed them from the imperious domination of one so
vastly their superior as Pitt, and placed over them a man whose talents
were not superior to their own, and whom they might hope to guide rather
than follow. Though Pitt acted honestly in the first instance, it is only
too probable that he regarded Addington as a temporary substitute for
himself, and designed to return to power after the present difficulty
was over, and when he had made a public demonstration for the purpose of
saving his honour. However this may be, his somewhat lukewarm support
was before long changed into open enmity. At first, however, he spoke
with even exaggerated admiration of the new Cabinet, which in the House
was completely successful, while great successes both by sea and land
somewhat relieved the nation from its embarrassing position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French army in Egypt.</div>

<p>The French army, deserted by their great commander, was left shut up
in Egypt under the command of Kleber, a man of organizing genius, who bid
fair to establish the French influence in that country. He was, however,
assassinated by a fanatical Mussulman (June 1800), and the command fell
into the hands of Menou, a general of but second-rate capacity. Before
this change of command, a treaty, known as the Treaty of El Arish, had
been completed (Jan. 24), by which the French army was to be allowed
a safe return to France. This convention was concluded on board the
flagship, and with the full approval of Sir Sidney Smith; but, meanwhile,
intercepted despatches had made known to the Cabinet the almost hopeless
condition of the French army, and orders were sent to the Mediterranean
that no treaties should be sanctioned by the admiral which did not
insist on the surrender of the French. The Treaty of El Arish had been
concluded without this knowledge and before these orders had reached Sir
Sidney Smith. Moreover, affairs in Egypt had much changed, for Kleber,
indignantly rejecting all idea of surrender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1232" id="Page_1232">[1232]</a></span>
had at once proceeded to attack the Turks, had won over them
a great victory at Heliopolis (March 20, 1800) and reoccupied Cairo.
It became necessary therefore to renew the war, and Sir Ralph Abercromby,
who, with Pulteney, had been employed in fruitless expeditions
against Ferrol and Cadiz, collecting the troops employed in both
expeditions, in number about 20,000, proceeded to Egypt. Troops
also under Sir David Baird were ordered to attack the country from
India. A landing was forced at Aboukir Bay, under the immediate
command of General afterwards Sir John Moore, and on the 21st of
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Alexandria. March 21, 1801.</span>
March a battle in the neighbourhood of Alexandria was fought, where
the French were thoroughly defeated. The English had to deplore the
loss of Sir Ralph Abercromby, but General Hutchinson, who succeeded
him, continued to act with vigour. The Grand Vizier, with a large but
disorderly Turkish army, attacked Cairo, while the English kept Menou
besieged in Alexandria. In June Cairo fell, and General Baird having
arrived from India, the combined English army compelled Menou to
capitulate in Alexandria on the 27th of August. The terms of surrender
were honourable. The French army was allowed to return to France, but
all ships, together with all the objects of art which the French had
collected, became the property of the conquerors. This success, which
showed the unbroken vigour of England, tended to accelerate the peace
which was gradually becoming necessary for all parties, and for which
negotiations were already set on foot in London with the full approbation
of Pitt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Copenhagen. April 2.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, but a few days after the victory of Alexandria, the
cloud which had risen in the Baltic was also dispersed.
The renewal of the Armed Neutrality, and the general
conduct of Russia, made it evident that that country
was engaged in the French interests. A fleet under Sir Hyde Parker,
with Nelson as second in command, was despatched to the Baltic.
Negotiation was tried with the Danes, but wholly unsuccessfully,
and Parker, a dilatory commander, was induced by Nelson's energy
to consent to an attack upon Copenhagen. The passage of the
Sound was forced without loss, but an examination of the enemy's
position showed that they had used the delay which had been given
them to great advantage. Shore batteries had been erected and put
into fighting trim; floating batteries established, and the harbour
covered with a line of vessels of all sorts four miles in length.
Within this lay the Danish fleet. Nelson offered to attack with ten
sail of the line; he was allowed twelve. The attack was made from
the south, Sir Hyde Parker on the outside threatening the batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1233" id="Page_1233">[1233]</a></span>
and the vessels at the mouth of the harbour. At ten o'clock on the 2nd
of April, Nelson began his attack. Several vessels grounded and were
rendered useless, and so hot was the engagement that Sir Hyde Parker
thought it better to hoist the signal for discontinuing action. Nelson
declined to obey it, and the other captains took their orders from him.
Many of the Danish ships had struck, but being constantly reinforced
from the shore, continued the fight, it is said, even after they had
surrendered. This was probably an accident; but Nelson took advantage
of it to write a friendly letter to the Crown Prince. "The Vice-Admiral
Lord Nelson," he said, "has been commanded to spare Denmark when she
no longer resists. The line of defence which covered her shores has
struck to the British flag; but if the firing is continued on the part
of Denmark, he must set on fire all the prizes he has taken without
having the power of saving the men who have so nobly defended them. The
brave Danes are the brothers, and should never be the enemies, of the
English." He then agreed to a truce while the wounded were moved from the
prizes. Having taken advantage of the lull to withdraw his fleet from
the difficult channel in which they were entangled, he went on shore to
negotiate a treaty. To enable him to attack the Russians, he insisted on
a long armistice, which a threat of immediate bombardment induced the
Danes to grant. The English fleet then sailed against the Swedes, who
withdrew, and were left unmolested, while the fleet proceeded against
the Russians. On his way, however, Nelson received the news that the
capricious despotism of Paul had excited his courtiers to a conspiracy,
which, though apparently aimed only at the deposition of the Emperor, had
in fact ended in his assassination. The accession of the young Emperor
Alexander I. completely changed the policy of Russia. The embargo was
removed from the British shipping and the merchant seamen liberated. As
the Armed Neutrality still existed, Nelson would have proceeded to strong
measures; but Sir Hyde Parker was satisfied, and though he was recalled,
the complete change in Russian policy <span class="sidenote">Peace
between England and Russia.</span> rendered further action unnecessary.
In June a treaty of peace was signed in St. Petersburg, by which the
Armed Neutrality, with its claims, was given up, but the right of search
accurately defined. It was also agreed that blockades must henceforward
be really efficient in order to be valid. Blockades by proclamation were
thus abolished, and could be only sustained when the blockading force was
sufficient to enforce them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminaries of peace. Oct. 1, 1801.</div>

<p>Bonaparte was still threatening an invasion of England, and gunboats
and rafts had been collected at Boulogne. These the Government ordered
Nelson to attack, but the attempt was on the whole unsuccessful. However,
the supremacy of England on the sea was so great that there could not be
much fear of the landing of a foreign army, and the French, defeated in
Egypt and thwarted in their Northern policy, were ready to come to terms.
In October the preliminaries of a treaty were signed. By this England
gave up all its conquests except Trinidad and Ceylon. "The Cape of Good
Hope was to be restored to the Batavian Republic, and to be used as a
free port. Malta was to be restored to the Knights of St. John,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
under the guarantee of one of the great powers; Porto Ferrajo was to be
evacuated. On the other side, the Republic of the Ionian Islands was to
be acknowledged, and the French were to withdraw from Naples and the
Roman States; the integrity of Portugal was to be secured; Egypt was to
be restored to the Porte, and the Newfoundland fisheries to be placed on
the same footing as before the war."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Although the preliminary treaty had been signed, it cost some
time and much anxious negotiation before its final ratification in the
March of the following year. These negotiations were held at
Amiens, on the part of England by Lord Cornwallis, on that of
France by Joseph Bonaparte, assisted by Talleyrand. At the opening
of Parliament, on the 29th of October 1801, the minister had
been able to mention in the King's speech with satisfaction both the
<span class="sidenote">Opinions in England concerning the peace.</span>
preliminary treaty with France and the arrangements with the Northern
powers which put an end to the threatened Armed Neutrality. By the
bulk of the people the return of peace had been hailed with extreme
delight. General Lauriston, who had brought the authority for signing
the preliminaries, had been received with a public ovation, the populace
had dragged his carriage through the streets, and London and other towns
had been illuminated. In completing these preliminaries Addington and
his friends had acted with the entire approbation of Pitt, who, at heart
cordially disliking war, had brought himself to believe that Bonaparte,
having now obtained the supreme power in France, would probably be
satisfied; at the same time, as he himself pointed out, Jacobinism had
been already checked in England, and the lesson taught to the world that
the fruit of Jacobin principles was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1235" id="Page_1235">[1235]</a></span>
terrorism and anarchy, and its end a military despotism. Seeing the
isolated position which England now occupied, and believing the causes
for further war removed, Pitt accepted the terms of the peace, although
the concessions on the part of England, especially the surrender of the
Cape of Good Hope, were no doubt great. With the support then of Pitt and
of the general feeling of the country, the ministry found in Parliament
large majorities in favour of their peace. But Pitt's views were by no
means shared by a considerable number of his late colleagues. Grenville,
Windham, and Spencer clung tenaciously to their old view that Bonaparte's
career was but beginning, that his policy would continue to be one of
aggression, that his present offers of peace were delusive, and that
for the honour of England and the safety of Europe the war should be
continued.</p>

<p>Before the preliminaries were ratified abundant proofs were given
that they were right and that Pitt was wrong. Taking advantage of
the exhausted condition of the Continent, of the eager desire of
Addington to secure peace, and of the position of England, which
was not only without allies, but unable while negotiations were still
pending to make objections upon the score of treaty rights, Bonaparte
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon appropriates Holland, Switzerland, and
Italy.</span> hastened to complete his ambitious projects&mdash;by the
appropriation of those smaller States which had already fallen into a
state of dependence upon France (the Republics of Holland, Switzerland,
and the North of Italy, now called the Cisalpine Republic), and by
the re-establishment of the French colonial power by means of a great
expedition to reconquer St. Domingo. His method of proceeding with regard
to the Republics was craftily arranged so as to give to the assumption
of French supremacy the appearance of voluntary action on the part
of the people themselves. For Holland a constitution was drawn up in
France of a strongly republican character, which, when rejected by the
National Assemblies of Holland, was put to the vote of the whole body
of the people, and being accepted by a very small minority, while the
rest abstained from voting, was declared established by the national
will (Oct. 17, 1801). In Switzerland, not yet ripe for annexation,
instructions were given to the French minister to thwart all efforts at
the formation of a stable constitution, and to keep things so unsettled
that an appeal to France was certain sooner or later to be made, while
French troops garrisoned the Republic ostensibly for the purpose of
keeping order. Less delicacy was used with regard to Italy. The chief
rulers of the Cisalpine Republic were summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1236" id="Page_1236">[1236]</a></span>
to Lyons, a constitution of Bonaparte's creation given them, and they
were ordered to elect as their President Bonaparte himself (Jan.
1802). The expedition to St. Domingo was made still further to advance
Napoleon's projects; for thither was sent, to be destroyed by the
climate, almost the whole of the army of the Rhine, the only part of the
military establishment of France not wholly devoted to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations at Amiens.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the projects for the ultimate annexation of Piedmont and
Genoa were carried on, and distinct orders sent to the negotiators at
Amiens to withdraw entirely from discussion the affairs of Holland,
Switzerland, and the Italian Republics, in other words, to treat with
England as if the affairs of Europe were entirely beyond her cognizance.
The withdrawal of these points of discussion left little to be settled
except minute points with regard to fisheries and prisoners, for
Bonaparte also entirely refused to entertain the idea of a commercial
treaty with England. The only point of interest left was Malta. According
to the preliminaries this island was to be evacuated and to be restored
to the Knights under the guarantee of Russia. But a new sovereign was now
upon the Russian throne less likely to be under the immediate influence
of France. Bonaparte therefore wished to change the terms, to destroy the
fortifications of the island, thus rendering it useless in a military
point of view, and to place it under the guardianship of the King of
Naples; in other words, to render it at once worthless to the English and
an easy prey to the French whenever they should desire to reoccupy it.
In their eagerness for peace the English ministry consented to be blind
to Bonaparte's aggressions, though firm upon the point of Malta, and
though they refused to acknowledge the existence of the newly-organized
republics. No doubt, what the English meant was that, for the sake of
peace, they would bear what Bonaparte had already done, but that any
further step would produce war. Bonaparte, on the other hand, argued that
the refusal to acknowledge these <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWO_PEACE_OF_AMIENS" id="EIGHTEEN_TWO_PEACE_OF_AMIENS"></a>Peace concluded.
March 27, 1802.</span> republics was in fact a resignation on the part of
England of the right of interference with them; henceforward that country
could not complain although they were incorporated with France. There
were thus a number of outstanding questions left unsettled at the peace,
which was finally completed on the 27th of March 1802.</p>

<p>But it had begun to be plain to all thinking men that it could be
but a short truce; and indeed Napoleon was already writing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1237" id="Page_1237">[1237]</a></span>
"a renewal of war was necessary for his existence, as the memory
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon mistakes the temper of England.</span>
of old victories was likely speedily to pass away." In fact, he totally
mistook the temper of England. Addington's ministry, no doubt, was
pledged to peace, and was anxious at all hazards to make it durable.
The people of England were indeed weary of the war and eagerly desirous
for peace; but they had lost none of their independence and pride, and
anything which should prove either that their honour was attacked,
their commercial activity trammelled, or their independence of action
limited, would easily produce a reaction, and bring them back to their
warlike temper. Bonaparte, while intending to renew the war sooner or
later, meant to keep the occasion in his own hands, but, trusting to
the weakness of Addington, he pursued a line of conduct exactly fitted
to prove to England the absolute necessity for an immediate renewal
of hostilities, and which touched the sensitive nation in its most
tender points. He never ceased from his course of aggression,
<span class="sidenote">Continues his aggressions.</span> thus treating the
remonstrances of England as if they were completely worthless and beside
the point. In August he annexed the island of Elba, in September the
whole of Piedmont, in October Parma and Placentia; and at length, taking
advantage of the carefully fostered disorders in Switzerland, he suddenly
occupied that most important military point with an army of 30,000 men
under Marshal Ney, and took to himself the title of Mediator of the Swiss
Republic. It has been mentioned that he refused a commercial treaty with
England at the Peace of Amiens; this under the plea of a desire for the
protection of native commerce he undoubtedly had a right to do; but he
now obliged all the countries dependent on him to adopt a similar course,
to exclude English productions, and thus closed half Europe to English
trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demands the repression of the English press,</div>

<p>Not content with this conduct abroad, he took upon himself to
interfere with the internal affairs of England. His
course of policy was such as to be wholly incompatible
with a free press; his underhand machinations were
certain to be exposed where such a press existed. On the Continent
he had succeeded in enforcing silence; in England alone an unfettered
press was able to direct its assaults both on his policy and
his character. No doubt some of the attacks were sharp enough;
especially had an emigrant, one Jean Peltier, established a French
paper in London called <i>L'Ambigu</i>, which was full of strong invective
against the First Consul. Again, the emigrants had not ceased from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1238" id="Page_1238">[1238]</a></span>
forming conspiracies against the French Government, conspiracies
<span class="sidenote">and the expulsion of the emigrants from
England.</span> which Bonaparte delighted to exaggerate, to mingle
with doubtful charges of assassination, and to connect (wholly without
grounds) with the English ministry. Those emigrants were enjoying the
hospitality of England: Otto, the French agent in London, was therefore
instructed to bring the matter to the notice of Lord Hawkesbury, and to
demand the suppression of the obnoxious papers, and the dismissal of the
emigrants from England. Hawkesbury's answers were at first of a peaceful
and conciliatory character. He replied that he would consult the law
officers on the matter of the press, and would go so far in the matter
of the emigrants as to withdraw them from the isle of Guernsey. This
answer was followed by still more peremptory demands, requiring effective
measures of repression with regard to the press, the withdrawal of the
emigrants from Jersey, the removal from England of the Bourbon princes,
and the expulsion of all emigrants wearing the orders or distinctions of
the old régime. What rendered these demands more grotesque was the fact
that the <i>Moniteur</i>, the official paper of France, was constantly full
of assertions of the complicity of the Government with the attempts of
assassins in France, and of libels on the English Constitution; there was
even an English paper, the <i>Argus</i>, published in Paris, a counterpart of
the <i>Ambigu</i> of Peltier. To demands thus formulated no English Government
could afford to give a temporizing answer, and Hawkesbury replied that
the freedom of the English press was limited by English law alone, and
that the exercise of hospitality could not be curtailed. At the same
time, as Peltier appeared to have exceeded all legal license in his
writing, an action was commenced against him, and in spite of a brilliant
defence by Macintosh he was found guilty.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Such conduct on the part of Bonaparte was rapidly changing the
feeling of England and rendering war inevitable. It became evident
that, no longer to uphold an aristocratic government, but for our
very existence as an independent country, we must plunge into war.
<span class="sidenote">Consequent change of feeling in England.</span> As
this feeling gained ground, so did the desire that when that war should
come it should find England in the hands of its ablest statesmen, and not
in those of an incapable man like Addington. Even from the first, as soon
as it was understood that Pitt, in deference to the King's weak state of
health, had consented to forego the support of the Roman Catholics, his
immediate friends had desired his return to office, and had regarded as
false his position as the supporter out of office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1239" id="Page_1239">[1239]</a></span>
Addington's weak ministry. Already, in November 1802, Canning,
<span class="sidenote">Negotiations for Pitt's return. Nov. 1802.</span>
the most eager of his supporters, in conjunction with Lord Malmesbury,
had set on foot an address to Addington begging him to resign. This plan
had been peremptorily closed by Pitt himself. Indeed, the obstacles in
the way of his resumption of office were very awkward. In some sort the
creator of the present ministry, and known to have had a share in most of
their earlier measures, Pitt could not come forward in opposition till
some flagrant instance of incapacity or some great national crisis should
justify such a step. The only other hope was that modesty (which was not
one of his characteristics) might induce Addington to acknowledge his
incompetence, and himself advise the restoration of Pitt to the ministry.
Fully aware of these obstacles, and feeling his position an anomalous
one, Pitt withdrew for a time from Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THREE_NAPOLEON_EXAMINES_RESOURCES" id="EIGHTEEN_THREE_NAPOLEON_EXAMINES_RESOURCES"></a>Napoleon examines the resources of Egypt, England,
and Ireland. 1803.</div>

<p>During his absence the difficulties with France continued to
increase, and the signs of Bonaparte's intention of
making war sooner or later became more obvious. At
length, in January 1803, was published a report of
Colonel Sebastiani, who had been sent by Napoleon,
nominally for commercial purposes, to examine the
resources of Egypt and the East; in fact, so far from being commercial
in its character, the report was devoted almost entirely to
show with what ease Egypt could be again conquered by the French.
It was impossible that such an official document could be issued by
a power which was really friendly. At the same time Bonaparte
had sent both to England and to Ireland agents who, under the
same commercial pretext, were really minutely examining the
resources of England and instigating Irish rebellion. Nor was the
question of Malta as yet at rest. The project of obtaining a
guarantee from the European powers had failed, and in face of the
constant aggressions of Bonaparte, it was impossible for England to
evacuate the island with the certainty that it would be immediately
occupied by the French. But Bonaparte was still anxious to keep
the occasion of war in his own hands, and still hoped to impose
<span class="sidenote">His interview with Lord Whitworth. Feb. 18,
1803.</span> upon the feeble ministry of England. He summoned Lord Whitworth,
the English ambassador, to an interview, in which he declared that he
did not desire war, but that he would rather see England in possession
of the Faubourg St. Antoine than of Malta, that he was ready to attempt
a descent upon England if necessary, but how much better would it be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1240" id="Page_1240">[1240]</a></span>
England to join with him and share his spoils and his greatness. Two
things only were necessary for this,&mdash;the suppression of the press,
and the removal of Georges, a Chouan leader and emigrant, from English
protection. As for the counter-charges of the appropriation of Piedmont
and of Switzerland, they were but trifles not worth mentioning. Almost
immediately after this the <i>Moniteur</i> declared, in its annual account of
the condition of the nation, that as long as party government existed
in England an army of 500,000 must be kept on foot for defence and
vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The militia embodied. March 11, 1803.</div>

<p>This was too much even for Addington, and on the 8th of March
a message was brought down from the King to the Commons, declaring
it necessary that measures of precaution should be
adopted, alleging for this the great military preparations
which were going on both in Holland and in France,
which were in fact intended for St. Domingo, but which in the
feverish state of international feeling were a just cause of uneasiness.
In accordance with this message the militia were on the 11th
ordered to be embodied. In spite of all that Bonaparte had done he
pretended to be indignant at this step; and at a public reception
at the Tuileries accosted Lord Whitworth with passionate words,
<span class="sidenote">Failure of renewed negotiations for Pitt's
return.</span> accusing England of driving him into war. Then at length
Addington began to yield to public feeling, and through Lord Melville
opened negotiations for the return of Pitt to office. But a frank
resignation and an open acknowledgment that Pitt was the better man of
the two was beyond him. He stipulated that Grenville and Windham, who had
throughout opposed him, should be excluded from the new arrangements. He
wished Lord Chatham to assume the position of nominal Prime Minister,
while he and Pitt should be equal Secretaries. Pitt was not a man to
accept a position of even nominal subordination; he did not even hear
Lord Melville's proposition to the end. "Upon my word," said he, "I had
not the curiosity to ask what I was to be." And thus England plunged
afresh into war, while all her best statesmen were still excluded from
office. For the crisis came rapidly nearer. The feeling of the nation
was aroused, and Addington could no longer withstand it. An ultimatum
with regard to Malta was drawn up, demanding its retention for ten years,
its surrender after that period to the inhabitants, and the cession to
England in its stead of the island of Lampedusa. Bonaparte was somewhat
taken aback by this exhibition of vigour, but as his answer to the
ultimatum was not satisfactory, Lord Whitworth demanded his passports, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1241" id="Page_1241">[1241]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">War declared. May 18, 1803.</span> withdrew from
Paris on the 12th of May. The French ambassador left London on the 16th,
and on the 18th a declaration of war was published.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the war.</div>

<p>This war was of a distinctly different character from that which
preceded it. The one had been undertaken in the interest of aristocracy
and of property, in a panic of fear of the growth of the liberty of the
people; now the whole nation was driven to defend itself, and, while
defending itself, Europe also, from the aggressions of a gigantic and
all-absorbing ambition. The outbreak of this war marks a change in the
career of Napoleon. He had hitherto acted, nominally at all events,
as an agent for the propagation of national liberty. He had pretended
throughout to be spreading the principles of the French Revolution; he
had met with much sympathy from downtrodden nations; he had found it
easy to overwhelm effete and unpopular dynasties. He was now entering
upon a war against the people themselves, and, though success at first
attended his arms, when it became evident that it was not assistance
against tyrants but subjugation to a foreign power that he brought, the
efforts to oppose him became national, and before the uprising of nations
he ultimately succumbed. Bonaparte's first step after war was declared
corresponded exactly with this <span class="sidenote">Napoleon arrests
all the English in France.</span> change. Crowds of Englishmen had
thronged to see with their own eyes the condition of revolutionized
France. All the English in France between the age of eighteen and sixty,
numbering it is believed about 12,000, were suddenly by a single decree
taken prisoners, and kept confined till the close of the war, thus
spreading sorrow and discomfort broadcast through England. The pretext
was the capture of two ships before war was declared; they were not
however captured till after the ambassadors had withdrawn, nor, as has
subsequently been made evident, till Bonaparte had himself ordered an
embargo to be laid on the English shipping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He excites discontent in Ireland.</div>

<p>Bonaparte's interference in the affairs of Ireland had also its
share in rendering the war truly national. It had been hoped that the
great work of the Union, following the suppression of the Rebellion
of 1798, would have introduced peace and prosperity into the island.
Nor at first did the hopes appear ill founded. Both Lord Hardwicke,
the Lord-Lieutenant, and Lord Redesdale the Chancellor, appear to have
believed in the rapid improvement both of the physical and political
condition of the country. The Catholics, although disappointed of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1242" id="Page_1242">[1242]</a></span>
hopes, seem to have understood the state of affairs which obliged Pitt
to refrain from the further prosecution of their claims, and to have
postponed all idea of present agitation.</p>

<p>But the miserable cultivation and the prevalence of waste lands
in Ireland allowed of the existence of an extremely ignorant and
prejudiced peasantry, and among them it was not difficult to excite
again their old animosity to England. Bonaparte took advantage of
this opening, and while the Peace of Amiens lasted many French
agents seem to have been poured into Ireland, both for the purpose
of inquiring minutely into the resources of the English Government
there and of establishing a connection with the discontented
peasantry. Many intercepted letters proved to Government the
existence of these agents; their presence in Ireland was excused,
like Sebastiani's mission to Egypt, by the assertion that they were
merely commercial agents, following a system which had obtained in
France ever since the time of Colbert. Their success was limited by
the distaste of the Catholics for the French Revolution. In spite of
Bonaparte's intercourse with Rome and the establishment of the
Concordat with Pius VII., by which he established Roman Catholic
Christianity as the religion of France, the Catholics could not forget
the destructive doctrines which had attended all the former steps of
the Revolution. It was therefore among the republicans only (not
an influential body) and the ignorant mob that the agitation took any
hold. A leader was found in Robert Emmett, the son of a Dublin
<span class="sidenote">Emmett's Rebellion. 1803.</span> physician, who
with his brother had been more or less implicated in the affairs of
1798. He visited Paris early in the Peace, had personal interviews with
the First Consul, and returned home ready to instigate the rebellion.
The other leaders were Russell, a religious enthusiast, and Quigley,
a professional agitator. About Christmas 1802 the conspirators began
their operations. Arms and powder were collected at depôts in Dublin,
and members of the conspiracy were enrolled. Some of these informed
the police of what was going on. The explosion of the powder in one of
the depôts, and the discovery of pikes there, still further warned the
Government, and Emmett considered it necessary to hasten the outbreak.
Saturday the 23rd of July was the day fixed for the rising. It proved to
be little more than a city riot. As no soldiery had been brought into
Dublin, it was for some time in the hands of the mob, who plundered and
got drunk. The only important incident of the riot was the murder of Lord
Kilwarden, the Chief Justice, who, returning from his country-seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1243" id="Page_1243">[1243]</a></span>
with his daughter and nephew, was met in the streets by a part of the mob
and brutally murdered. The arrival at the castle of his daughter, who
had contrived to make her escape from the murderers, at length set the
military in motion, and the mob was dispersed without much difficulty.
The depôt was discovered, with the supply of arms, green uniforms, and
the proclamation of the provisional government which was to have been
established. Emmett sought safety by pretending to be a French officer;
but the French were not liked; his flight was not favoured by the people;
he was captured and hanged. The importance of the outbreak lies chiefly
in the disclosure of the deepseated hostility of the Irish, and the
necessity laid upon the English of establishing a series of coercive
laws, which remained in force for many years, and went far to neutralize
the healing effect which it was hoped the Union would have exercised.</p>

<p>The declaration of war called Pitt from his retirement, for the war, in
the form it had now assumed, seemed to demand the co-operation of all
patriotic men. Pitt therefore again appeared in the House; he thought
it his duty to see, now that war had come, that no laxity was displayed
in its support, and returned to his place, intending, as he himself said,
not to join in any opposition to the ministry so long as their measures
seemed energetic, but to forget all that was past (and many things
had been done of which he could not fully approve) and devote himself
to insuring vigour and activity for the future. Few positions could
now be more embarrassing than that of Addington. His peaceful
plans had come to nothing; and conscious, as he could not but have
been, of his own inferiority, and of the general desire under present
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty of Addington's position.</span>
circumstances for Pitt's return to office, he had now to
withstand the powerful attacks of an unusually able
Opposition, and the damaging criticism of a so-called
friend whom all the world regarded as his rival. And it must be
owned that Pitt's views were far more in accordance with the views
of the Opposition than with those of the minister. Grenville, Windham,
and Spencer, the consistent supporters of the preceding war,
had entered into a close alliance with Fox, its consistent opponent.
Their common view, which was shared by Pitt, was that the condition
of the country was so critical that nothing but the ablest
possible ministry could be tolerated&mdash;that the present ministry,
consisting as it for the most part did of the least able members of Pitt's
old Government, was wholly incompetent to meet the present dangers,
and that the one thing necessary was a great combined arrangement
by which the administration of affairs should be intrusted to men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1244" id="Page_1244">[1244]</a></span>
all parties of the widest experience and the greatest talents. They
were naturally anxious that Pitt, whose views they knew to be almost
identical with their own, should openly join them, but, as has been
seen, although he shared their views, he felt himself still bound to
give some sort of support to a ministry which he had himself created,
and which nominally upheld the same principles which he had always
advocated. In this trying position Addington's Government showed
<span class="sidenote">His vigorous measures inefficiently carried
out.</span> very creditable activity. Their budgets, with which Pitt had
at first been discontented, were now conceived in accordance with his
own principles. A considerable portion of the increased burden was borne
by taxation, especially by the reimposition of a property tax, and loans
were contracted only as far as needful. Militia to the number of about
70,000 were embodied; an army of reserve 50,000 strong, raised by ballot
to serve for four years, voted; and by a Bill, known as the Military
Service Bill, the enrolment as volunteers of all men between the ages of
seventeen and fifty-five provided for. The number of these volunteers
speedily rose to beyond 300,000. As the standing army was kept at about
120,000, there must have been of one sort or other upwards of 500,000
armed men for the purposes of defence. The temper of the nation was
thoroughly roused. Pitt himself, as Warden of the Cinque Ports, raised
and commanded 3000 volunteers, and caused considerable offers of gunboats
to be sent in to the Government from the maritime towns.</p>

<p>But great though these preparations were, they were carried out
with a dilatoriness and want of energy in which Pitt and the Opposition
found much cause of complaint. Windham was an enthusiast
for the regular army and disliked the volunteers. Pitt pointed
out, that although volunteers were exempted from serving in the
militia, they could only claim their exemption when properly
enrolled and armed, and the issue of arms was so slow as to throw a
great damp upon volunteering, which this exemption was intended
to encourage. There was also a great blot in the administration
which afforded plentiful room for attack. Lord St. Vincent, great
<span class="sidenote">Increasing opposition.</span> as an admiral, had
proved himself incompetent as the head of the Admiralty. In the desire of
the ministry for economy many of the gunboats and other ships had been
rapidly broken up, and the stores in the dockyards sold, much of them to
the French themselves. Attacks directed on these points began to tell.
Other circumstances combined to drive Pitt to declare himself. He was
perfectly conscious of his own greatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1245" id="Page_1245">[1245]</a></span>
and of the universal feeling that his present position was
unworthy of him, and he believed that he was the right man to be
intrusted with the Government in the present crisis. It was with
much alarm that he heard that the King's health was again failing.
There seemed every prospect that a regency would be necessary.
If that regency were established, it was understood that Lord
Moira, the Prince of Wales' chief adviser, would be called upon
to form a Government. Pitt declared that under those circumstances
he should be compelled to decline office; fearful of being
thus permanently removed from the ministry, he thought the
time for action had arrived; if he was to be minister at all he
must take steps to become so; he therefore declared his total want
of confidence in the present ministry, and stated his intention,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FOUR_PITT_OFFERS" id="EIGHTEEN_FOUR_PITT_OFFERS"></a>Pitt offers to undertake the Government.</span>
should the state of the King's health permit, of writing to him, stating
his views, and putting himself at his Majesty's service; he desired,
if possible, a broad Government, but that if the King objected to that
he should state his willingness to attempt to form one even upon a
narrow basis. He further declared his belief that after the recess the
combined Opposition would be sufficiently strong to compel the ministers
to resign. Addington also was so conscious of this, that when, on the
reopening of Parliament on the 5th of April, the Opposition assault
began, he authorized Lord Eldon to enter into communication with Pitt.
Through the Chancellor the letter before alluded to was laid before the
King. Meanwhile the ministerial majorities were diminishing. The Irish
Militia Bill was carried by a majority of twenty-one only, at that time
regarded as very small. On the 23rd Fox moved to refer all Army Bills
to a committee of the whole House. His motion was rejected by only
fifty-two; while, <span class="sidenote">Addington resigns. April 26,
1804.</span> two days afterwards, on his attack on the Army of Reserve
Bill, the ministerial majority again sunk to thirty-seven in a House of
443 members. Upon this Addington resigned.</p>

<p>On the 30th Mr. Pitt was informed of the King's desire that he
should draw up a plan for a new administration; he accordingly
stated, first in writing, and subsequently (May 7) in a long interview,
<span class="sidenote">Pitt desires a broad ministry.</span> what he
considered best for the country. On three grounds he strongly urged
a large and comprehensive ministry. The war was a national one, and
promised to be both long and expensive; to induce the nation to make the
required sacrifice unanimity was most desirable. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1246" id="Page_1246">[1246]</a></span>
wage war singlehanded was beyond the power of England; but
while party divisions were rife in Parliament the confidence of
foreign nations could not be gained. And lastly, if the King
wished to keep the question of the Catholic emancipation from
discussion, it was desirable that there should be no formidable
Opposition certain to make use of the Catholic claims as a means of
offence against Government. On these grounds the new minister
urged the admission of both Grenville and Fox to the ministry; but
he here found the King obstinate. Grenville he would admit, Fox
never. The course that statesman had followed with regard to the
American War, his strong language in favour of the Revolution, his
strenuous opposition to the last French war, had rendered him
politically hateful to the King. His friendship for the Prince of
Wales, and the share which the King believed he had taken in the
<span class="sidenote">Pitt yields to the King's opposition.</span>
direction of the Prince's conduct, had excited his strong personal
dislike. To these prejudices Pitt, in an evil hour for himself, yielded.
He had indeed, as he had already stated, intended to do so. He consented
to exclude Fox from his arrangements. But he still hoped to win the
support of his old colleague Grenville, and since Fox, with great
magnanimity, told his partisans that he had no wish that the King's
personal prejudice against himself should influence their conduct, he
was not without hopes of strengthening his Government by the addition of
some of the Whigs. These hopes were disappointed. The two sections of
the Opposition held separate but simultaneous meetings. In one Grenville
declared he would not take office without Fox, and his followers accepted
his decision; in the other the friends of Fox <span class="sidenote">He
forms a Tory ministry.</span> determined to decline office if their
chief was excluded. No resource was therefore left to Pitt but to form
his government as best he could upon a narrow Tory basis. The political
sections from which he was enabled to draw were his own immediate
followers, and such of the late minister's as did not feel themselves
pledged to follow Addington in his retirement. The result was not wholly
satisfactory. Lord Eldon, the Duke of Portland, Lord Westmoreland,
Lord Castlereagh, and Lord Hawkesbury, continued to hold office, Lord
Hawkesbury surrendering the important post of Foreign Secretary to Lord
Harrowby, and receiving in exchange the Home Office. Dundas, who had been
created a Peer as Lord Melville, became First Lord of the Admiralty,
while Lord Camden, Lord Mulgrave, and the Duke of Montrose, also became
members of the Cabinet, which consisted of twelve, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1247" id="Page_1247">[1247]</a></span>
whom, with the exception of Pitt and Castlereagh, were in the Upper
House. Several other men of importance were admitted to subordinate
offices; Canning became Treasurer of the Navy, Huskisson one
of the Secretaries of the Treasury, and Mr. Perceval, the future
Prime Minister, remained in the position of Attorney-General.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties of Pitt's position.</div>

<p>The change of ministry implied a complete change of policy. As
Addington's ministry had been from the first intended as a peace
ministry, so the accession of Pitt to office implied a vigorous
prosecution of the war. But it was with very maimed influence that it
entered upon its work; all hope of acting in foreign affairs with the
full weight of a great combined national party behind him had disappeared
from Pitt's view. The same opposition which had opposed Addington was
ready to oppose him; while Addington himself, unable to act in any
great or magnanimous manner, had also joined its ranks, and was in open
opposition to his old friend. It was with a majority scarcely larger than
that of the ministry he had succeeded, supported by the same mediocre
men, and aided in the Commons by one minister alone, that Pitt found
himself obliged to encounter the bitter enmity of Bonaparte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Real danger from France.</div>

<p>The necessity for energy Pitt probably felt more strongly than any of
his contemporaries. Strange incredulity was expressed both by Fox and
Grenville as to the reality of the invasion with which Bonaparte was
threatening England. Yet it is certain that the intention of invasion
was perfectly real. Bonaparte had determined to carry out the threat
he had let drop to Lord Whitworth. In the first place it suited his
policy to keep his army together and thoroughly employed. The temper of
the Parisians was lukewarm; he felt that some pressure was necessary
to induce them to give him the support his ambition required, and such
coercion could in no way be more certainly procured than by exciting the
personal devotion and enthusiasm of his soldiers by unfolding before them
constant visions of glory. At the same time his exasperation against
the English led him to underrate the difficulties which lay in his way,
and to believe in the real practicability of his scheme. The minute and
careful preparations in which he engaged are incompatible with the idea
that the invasion was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1248" id="Page_1248">[1248]</a></span>
mere feint. In all the ports of the Channel boats were being built;
even inland towns with any water communication with the sea were busily
employed in the same labour. A great basin was constructed at Boulogne,
of a peculiar shape, intended to allow of an extremely rapid embarkation
of the army, which was encamped upon the neighbouring heights, and
fortifications were raised to render the flotilla secure from the sea.
Yet in all probability, had the plan been tried, it would have proved a
failure. The boats used to transport the troops were to be of several
classes and sizes, and the mere action of the tides, which are of
great strength and complexity in the Channel, would have been exerted
quite differently on these different sized vessels, and would almost
of necessity have separated the flotilla; yet the whole success of the
movement depended on the simultaneous landing of the army at one point.
Moreover, for the passage of heavily-laden and flat-bottomed boats an
absolute calm of two days would have been necessary, and a calm of two
days is a phenomenon of rare occurrence in the Channel; while, thirdly,
success presupposed the complete absence or idleness of the British
fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations for defence.</div>

<p>However, whether practicable or impracticable, Napoleon intended to
make the effort, and Pitt, in common with the English nation, believed
in his intention. The excitement was universal. The country was entirely
occupied in drilling and warlike preparations; martello towers were built
along the southern coast, beacons rose on every hilltop, a great canal
or ditch was dug along the coast of Kent, and Pitt excited the ridicule
of Grenville by the energy with which he superintended the numerous
reviews which he set on foot through his brother Lord Chatham. Such
defences have been derided as ridiculously inefficient, and certainly
neither the Kentish ditch nor a few round towers mounting one gun each,
nor a half-disciplined militia, could have checked the French army had
a landing been effected. The real value of such preparations was the
life and energy and courage which they roused in the people. The more
real work of the minister was the restoration of the national forces to
their full efficiency, and the effort to induce the other countries of
Europe to combine in withstanding the dangerous ambition of the French
usurper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Additional Force Bill.</div>

<p>With regard to the army the great ministerial measure was the
Additional Force Bill. There existed at this time two
systems of enlistment, the one for a limited term, the
other for the general service; the recruiting officers in these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1249" id="Page_1249">[1249]</a></span>
branches had entered into a sort of competition, the effect of which
was that very large and quite unnecessary bounties were offered to
induce men to enlist on one or other of the two systems. A second
difficulty was one which constantly attends a volunteer army, the
difficulty of procuring a constant and regular supply of recruits.
The intention of the Additional Force Bill was to obviate these two
difficulties. Pitt thought that this might be done by raising an
additional force of 50,000 men, whence a supply of trained soldiers
could be constantly passed into the regular army. There already
existed an army of reserve, collected under the Reserve Bill passed
by the late ministry, but its full complement of 50,000 had not been
reached; there was a deficiency of 9000 men. At the same time
the militia had risen much beyond its usual numbers. It was at
present 74,000 strong, instead of 40,000 for England and 8000 for
Scotland, which was regarded as its normal strength. The present
Bill reduced the militia to its old dimensions. The remainder,
with the 9000 as yet unraised men of the army of reserve, was to
form the additional force from which 12,000 annually were to pass
into the army. Parishes were to be assessed at a certain number of
men, and if they failed to supply them a moderate fine was to be
laid upon them, to go to the general recruiting fund. It was an
attempt, in fact, to introduce in some degree the principle of compulsory
service, already slightly recognized in the militia. The
newly-organized body had this also in common with the militia,
that it was connected with the regular army by forming second
battalions not bound to serve abroad, but to be used to supply the
place of the regular army when it was required for foreign service.
It was supposed that there would be no difficulty, when military
habits were once formed, in finding the annual 12,000 to feed the
regular troops. The whole strength of the Opposition was brought
to bear against the Bill, which certainly, in its compulsory clauses,
introduced a new principle into the English military system, and it
was only with the comparatively weak majority of forty that it was
<span class="sidenote">Increase of the navy.</span> carried through the
House. As far as the naval forces were concerned energy and activity
were all that was required, and these were supplied by Lord Melville. In
the first year of his administration he could boast that he had added to
the fleet no less than 166 vessels, either completed or in a state of
forwardness, while during the same period 600 ships had been docked and
repaired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon attempts to form a coalition.</div>

<p>With regard to foreign affairs Pitt's position did not at first seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1250" id="Page_1250">[1250]</a></span>
hopeful. He wished to follow out the policy of the last war, and to
form a third coalition. But Bonaparte was engaged in almost the same
process in opposition to England, and the chances at first seemed all
in favour of the success of the French in this vast competition. By the
Treaty of Lunéville those German princes who had been dispossessed by
the advance of the French to the Rhine, and by the withdrawal of Tuscany
from the House of Austria, were to be indemnified at the expense of the
ecclesiastical principalities of the Empire. This arrangement might have
been carried out without much difficulty by the Germans themselves, but
the avarice of the great powers Prussia and Austria, and the difficulty
which the smaller princes found in obtaining their restitutions, rendered
mediation necessary, and by a strange act of folly the arbitration of
Bonaparte himself was sought. He had used this opportunity to flatter
Russia by suggesting that the Emperor should be joined with himself
in the duty of arbitration, to please Prussia by unduly favouring its
claims, and to foment all the rivalries of the Germanic body. He had
further, on the rupture of the Peace of Amiens, suggested that some of
the points at issue should be decided by the arbitration of Russia,
hoping thereby to silence for ever any complaints Alexander might have to
urge against him, so that neither that power nor Prussia was disposed to
be unfriendly to him, while Austria was exhausted under the late heavy
blow which had been dealt her, and much occupied by the rivalry of the
other German powers. But in spite of this appearance of friendship of
both Russia and Prussia for France there were secret causes of hostility
between them. Alexander had seen through the somewhat barefaced attempt
to purchase his favour by the offer of the position of arbitrator, and
while consenting to act as mediator, had continued to urge the injustice
of the conduct of the French with regard both to Piedmont and to Germany.
To such an extent had the angry correspondence been carried, that a
scene had taken place (July 29, 1803) between Bonaparte and the Russian
ambassador very similar to that with Lord Whitworth. With Prussia also
the ambition of the first Consul had prevented him from completing his
work of conciliation. He had displeased that Court by a persistent
refusal to withdraw his troops from Hanover. On the whole, the feeling of
Lord Harrowby, when he entered upon the plan of forming a coalition, was
that his best hope lay in the direction of Russia; but that all Europe
would remain quiet till the great invasion of England should either have
destroyed that power or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1251" id="Page_1251">[1251]</a></span>
by its repulse offer a favourable opportunity for assaulting France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon's conduct with regard to Georges'
conspiracy.</div>

<p>Napoleon's own conduct went far to remove all expected difficulties.
No one could have played more completely into the hands of his enemies.
A conspiracy was set on foot against his Government by the royalists;
it was principally in the hands of Georges, the Breton leader, and of
General Pichegru. At the right moment the Count of Artois was to appear
upon the scene, and the Bourbons to be re-established. The police and
Bonaparte obtained early information of it. Bonaparte made use of his
knowledge to foster the conspiracy, and to implicate General Moreau, whom
he had always regarded as his rival since the battle of Hohenlinden,
and who appears to have been guilty only of having consented to be
reconciled to his old friend Pichegru, from whom political differences
had separated him. Although there is not the slightest proof of the truth
of the fact, it was asserted that the plan included the assassination
of the First Consul; and, determined to make the most of his knowledge
of the conspiracy, Bonaparte sent agents, who entrapped two of our
ministers abroad, Messrs. Drake and Spencer Smith, into consenting to
the conspiracy. Of the real plot they knew nothing, but were led to
believe in the existence of some royalist scheme and to lend it their
aid. Bonaparte then charged them publicly with having joined in a plan
of assassination, demanded, and ultimately (April 1804) succeeded in
procuring, their expulsion from Bavaria and Wurtemburg, and sent to
all the Courts of Europe a coarse and virulent attack upon the English
Government. The reply of Lord Hawkesbury (April 30)&mdash;for this took
place during the Addington ministry&mdash;to the effect that England had
the right, and would use the right, of taking advantage of the political
situation of countries with which she was at war, justified the conduct
of England in the eyes of all foreign powers, and excited a strong
feeling against the conduct of the Consul. The conspiracy was followed by
a still more startling act of violence. Unable to secure the person of
the Count of Artois, who received timely warning of the plot, and burning
to strike some blow against <span class="sidenote">Murder of the Duc
d'Enghien. March 21, 1804.</span> the Bourbons, Bonaparte, regardless of
the neutrality of the country, sent a body of troops into Baden, there
captured an innocent and unoffending Bourbon prince, the Duc d'Enghien,
son of the Prince of Condé, brought him into France, had him summarily
tried by a military tribunal, and immediately shot. The effect of this
great crime upon the crowned heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1252" id="Page_1252">[1252]</a></span>
of Europe was instantaneous, and was not decreased when Bonaparte
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon Emperor. May 18, 1804.</span>
threw off all mask of moderation, and gave an outward form to the
despotism he had long practised by declaring himself Emperor. But there
were still many difficulties to be overcome before the Courts of Europe
could be brought to see the absolute necessity of forming a coalition. It
required a whole year of negotiation, and of further proofs of Napoleon's
character, before Pitt's object was attained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Harrowby's retirement. Dec. 1804.</div>

<p>The loss of his able Foreign Minister added fresh difficulties to
his negotiations. In December 1804 Lord Harrowby was disabled by an
accidental fall, and had to resign the Foreign Office. His place was
supplied by Lord Mulgrave; but Pitt was made conscious of the weakness
of his ministry by the severe blow that the loss of one member of it
was to him. Addington, since his retirement from office, had been in
open opposition to the minister; but as their views were generally
similar, and the division between them had been entirely owing to the
soreness arising from the manner in which Addington had lost the
<span class="sidenote">Addington rejoins the ministry.</span> premiership,
there seemed no reason for a further separation. Addington therefore
rejoined the ministry, taking the title of Lord Sidmouth and the office
of President of the Council, which the Duke of Portland was compelled by
ill health to resign. Pitt's majority was thus increased, although the
strength gained by the adhesion of Addington himself to his ministry was
not much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spain joins France.</div>

<p>While the negotiations for a coalition were continuing, England
carried on the war singlehanded, and before long such
power as Spain possessed was added to that of France.
To support his vast expenditure Napoleon demanded subsidies from
foreign countries under his influence, and a treaty had been made
with Spain, now ruled entirely by Godoy, Prince of the Peace, by
which a considerable sum was annually paid to the French exchequer.
Although this was virtually an act of hostility to England, the
English ministry, aware of the weakness of Spain, had passed it over
in silence; but at the same time our minister, in February 1804,
declared that the preparation of any naval armaments in Spanish
ports would be regarded as a cause of war. In September the
English admiral on the coast of Spain notified the existence of such
an armament in Ferrol; a strong note was written to the Spanish
minister, and ultimately the English ambassador retired from
Madrid in November, and in December war was declared. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1253" id="Page_1253">[1253]</a></span>
already in October, before the declaration of war, the English had
seized four treasure-ships, well knowing that the money would
sooner or later find its way into the hands of Napoleon. The
justice of the action was questioned; but, considering the declaration
of the preceding February, and the known fact that Spain paid
subsidies to France, the seizure seems to have been thoroughly
justified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of attempts to destroy Napoleon's
fleet.</div>

<p>While our enemy was thus strengthened by the open adhesion of a
country which could at least assist him with ships and convenient
harbours, our efforts to weaken his preparations for invasion, which
were continually being pushed on, were unavailing; descents were made
upon the coast and a few outlying boats captured; but the great attempt
which was made in October to destroy the flotilla produced no result. The
expedition is known as the Catamaran expedition. It was proposed by means
of vessels filled with combustibles to burn the flotilla in Boulogne
harbour, but when the fire-ships were sent in, they either failed to
reach the vessels, or a passage was made for them, and they drifted
harmlessly through.</p>

<p>It was only outside the limits of Europe that the English showed a
decided superiority, and that great successes kept up the hope of
both ministry and people during this fearful period, when the arrival
of Bonaparte in England was daily expected, and when as yet all
Europe seemed to hold aloof from our alliance. Surinam had been
<span class="sidenote">Success of the war in India against the
Mahrattas.</span> conquered from the Dutch, and in the year 1805 a
great war was brought to a triumphant conclusion in India. After the
capture in 1799 of Seringapatam, the capital of Tippoo Sahib, the ruler
of Mysore, the territories of Mysore had been divided by what is known
as the Tripartite Treaty between the English, the Nizam of the Deccan,
and a descendant of the ancient Rajahs of Mysore, whom Hyder Ali had
dispossessed. By these new acquisitions the English had come in contact
with the great Mahratta power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of the Mahratta empire.</div>

<p>The great empire conquered by this warlike race, which had been
founded by Sivajee in the seventeenth century, extended from Delhi in
the north to the Tumbudra, a southern tributary of the Kistna on the
south, and from the Bay of Bengal on the east to Gujerat in the west. The
authority of the Rajah of Satara, nominal head of the race, had passed
into the hands of his minister the Peishwa, who resided at Poonah, in the
Western Ghauts. His authority had in turn become nominal, and the empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1254" id="Page_1254">[1254]</a></span>
was broken up among five great chiefs, of whom the Peishwa may be ranked
as one. The others were the Bonslah or Rajah of Berar, occupying the
north and east of the Deccan, and including Cuttack and the mouths of
the Mahanadi in his territories; Sindia, who occupied the north-west of
the Deccan and Kandesh, and whose property extended northwards through
a portion of Malwa as far as Delhi, of which he held possession, and
westward into Gujerat, where he had considerable property; Holkar,
who lay almost entirely in the Malwa, north of the Vindyha range of
mountains, to the east of Sindia, between him and Berar; and, lastly,
the Guicowar, who possessed in Gujerat all except those territories that
were in the hands of Sindia. He alone of the Mahratta chiefs preserved
neutrality during this great war. To the south of the Mahratta states lay
that part of the Deccan which was governed by the Nizam, now tributary
to the English; and south of his dominions, touching on its north-west
the southern extreme of the Mahratta country, was Mysore. All three
Presidencies were therefore in contact with one or other of the Mahratta
states.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the century the Mahrattas were at war among
themselves, and Holkar, in his rivalry with Sindia, had thought it
advisable to expel the Peishwa from Poonah, and to set up a creature
of his own there. The deposed Peishwa sought an asylum among
the English in Bombay. The presence of the predatory chief Holkar
in the south induced the English to occupy their northern frontier
in Mysore with an army of observation. While things were in this
position the Peishwa offered to enter into a perpetual treaty with
the English if they would reinstate him in Poonah. Lord Wellesley
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWO_WELLESLEYS_SUBSIDIARY_SYSTEM" id="EIGHTEEN_TWO_WELLESLEYS_SUBSIDIARY_SYSTEM"></a>Lord Wellesley's subsidiary system.</span> was at
this time Governor-General of India. He had set on foot a policy which
had been much opposed by the authorities in the India House, and the
support of which by Pitt had been constantly assaulted by the Opposition.
This policy is known as the subsidiary system. It was found impossible,
in the presence of the native powers, naturally anxious to rid themselves
of the English conquerors, and certain to find ready assistance from
the French, to remain in a state of inaction. On the other hand,
Wellesley did not think it desirable or just to conquer and annex all
the neighbouring territories, which would in fact only have enlarged the
sphere of danger. He preferred to establish English influence, to oblige
the native rulers to enter into permanent treaties with him, to place
the political management of their provinces in the hands of a British
resident, to pay for the support of an army largely officered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1255" id="Page_1255">[1255]</a></span>
by Europeans, while the native princes, at the same time, retained the
domestic government in their own hands. It is now generally allowed that
this was a wise system, but at the time the outcry against it was so
great, that even after the success of the Mahratta war Wellesley had in
fact to yield to it, and returned to England in 1805. While this policy,
however, was uppermost, such an offer as that of the Peishwa was certain
to be accepted, and at the end of 1802, by the Treaty of Bassein, the
English accepted the friendship of the Peishwa, and undertook to restore
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THREE_THE_MAHRATTA_WAR" id="EIGHTEEN_THREE_THE_MAHRATTA_WAR"></a>Outbreak of the Mahratta war. 1803.</div>

<p>The threatening attitude of the English compelled the Mahratta chiefs
for a time to lay aside their private enmities, and Holkar, Sindia, and
the Rajah of Berar made common cause against the invaders. What rendered
this coalition more formidable was, that Sindia had established in the
Douab, or district lying between the Jumna and the Ganges, a French state
in the hands of a certain M. Perron, in which there was a considerable
number of troops drilled in the European fashion, and officered by
Frenchmen, while in the south, the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, which
had been restored to France by the Peace of Amiens, gave an opening
to that power to interfere should war again break out in Europe. The
first act of the war was rapidly and successfully carried out. General
Wellesley marched, in the spring of 1803, from the frontier of Mysore,
was joined by Colonel Stevenson with the Nizam's army from Hyderabad,
recaptured Poonah on the 20th of April, and by the middle of May had
reinstated the Peishwa. The General at that time believed that all
disputes with the Mahratta powers would be settled by negotiation. It
before long became evident that on the part of the Mahrattas these
negotiations were a feint, and that the three chiefs, with their French
allies on the north, were still determined to fight, and had designs upon
the territories of the subsidiary Prince, the Nizam, who was at the point
of death. To withstand this great confederacy a large and well-combined
plan of operations was made. To secure unity of action, General Wellesley
was invested with supreme authority in the Deccan, General Lake was given
similar powers in the valley of the Ganges, while secondary attacks
were directed against Sindia's territories in Gujerat under the command
of Colonel Murray, and against the Bonslah's province of Cuttack under
Colonel Harcourt. The confederation was thus assaulted simultaneously
at four points. In the meantime the rupture of the Peace of Amiens had
become known. Pondicherry was carefully watched, and French troops
recently landed there taken prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1256" id="Page_1256">[1256]</a></span></p>

<p>In August General Wellesley left Poonah, Colonel Stevenson
acting in correspondence with him further to the east. He marched
direct to Ahmednuggur, which he captured, crossed the Godavery
river, and arrived at Aurungabad. Meanwhile Sindia had fallen
back northward, and in September the two English commanders
joined their forces a little to the east of Aurungabad, and advanced
to meet him. Sindia's forces, reinforced by sixteen battalions
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Assye. Sept. 23, 1803.</span>
officered by Frenchmen, lay not far from Assye on the
river Kaitna; between them and the English extended
a range of hills; to prevent their escape the English
commanders separated&mdash;Stevenson marching by the eastern, Wellesley
by the western end of the range. When Wellesley heard that
the enemy were moving off, he determined upon an attack without
waiting for Stevenson's arrival. To get at the enemy it was necessary
to cross the river which was on his right; although assured by
his guide that it was impassable, he conjectured the existence of a
passage from the appearance of two villages immediately opposite
each other on the two banks of the river. He found his conjecture
was correct, and his troops, when they had crossed the river, exactly
occupied the space between that and another stream on which Assye
stands. His two flanks were thus covered. He there with 4500
men entirely defeated Sindia's army, numbering more than 30,000.
At the close of the day he found himself in possession of nearly
100 cannon and the whole of the camp equipage. The General
mentioned it afterwards as the bloodiest battle for the numbers that
he ever saw; the killed and wounded among the English amounting
to more than 1500, a third of their entire force. The Mahratta
army separated into two divisions, one division under the Rajah of
Berar retiring westward as though to attack Poonah. Leaving
Stevenson, therefore, to follow the northern division under Sindia,
Wellesley hastened in pursuit of the Rajah. Sindia, being close
pressed by Stevenson, begged for a truce; but as it was found that
his troops were still serving in the army of the Rajah of Berar, and
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Argaum.</span> that the truce was
merely deceptive, the pursuit was recommenced, and the enemy brought
to a final engagement on the plain of Argaum, where they were again
entirely defeated. The war in the Deccan was closed by the capture,
by the combined armies, of Gawulgur, near the sources of the Taptee
river. Two days afterwards, on the 17th of December, the
<span class="sidenote">Subsidiary treaties with Sindia and Berar.</span>
Rajah of Berar submitted, and before the end of the month Sindia also
consented to treat. By these treaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1257" id="Page_1257">[1257]</a></span>
the province of Cuttack was annexed to the English possessions, Sindia
was driven entirely from the Deccan, and lost some strong places in the
Douab. Both princes entered into subsidiary arrangements, and promised to
admit no foreigners but English to their confidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lake's successes in the Douab.</div>

<p>These treaties were the consequence of the combined campaigns of
Wellesley and Lake; for during the brilliant campaign of Assye in the
Deccan, Lake had been carrying on war with equal success in the valley
of the Ganges. The French province in the Douab had given but little
trouble. Perron had retired from one of his fortresses, Coel, without
fighting; his second stronghold, Alleghur, had been captured; his troops
had indeed remained to fight, but he had himself surrendered to the
English. The capture of Alleghur had been followed by a great victory
over the Mahrattas within sight of Delhi. Lake had entered that capital,
restored the aged Shah Allum to the Mogul throne, and attached to the
English by so doing the whole Mahommedan population of India. He had won
further victories at Muttra and Agra on the Jumna, and finally, on the
1st of November, at the same time that Wellesley was carrying out the
pursuit which preceded the battle of Argaum, won the great battle of
Laswari. The secondary attacks had been no less successful. While Murray
had captured Baroach and subjugated the rest of Sindia's possessions in
Gujerat, Harcourt had secured Cuttack at the mouths of the Mahanadi and
the great temple of Juggernaut. The subsidiary treaties signed
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FIVE_CONCLUSION_OF_THE_WAR" id="EIGHTEEN_FIVE_CONCLUSION_OF_THE_WAR"></a>Conclusion of the war. 1805.</span> at the close of
the year were the consequences of this series of victories. In reward
for their services Lake was raised to the Peerage and Wellesley made a
Knight of the Bath. Holkar alone remained unsubdued. The following year,
1804, he was again in arms, and though thoroughly defeated by General
Lake, succeeded in obtaining the support of the Rajah of Berhampoor, and
prolonged the war till the close of the year 1805.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sad close of Pitt's career.</div>

<p>The success in India was no doubt of great importance both in
sustaining the courage of the people and in cheering the last days of
Pitt; but he was not destined to close his life in happiness and triumph.
He lived, indeed, long enough to see the great coalition for which he
had been working completed, and to receive the adhesion to it of Russia,
Austria, Sweden, and Naples; he lived long enough to see the English
again triumphant upon the ocean, to hear the news of the greatest victory
which had ever attended their arms, and to rejoice at the dispersion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1258" id="Page_1258">[1258]</a></span>
of the threatening cloud which for more than a year had hung over
the country. But he also lived just long enough to see, as far as his
foreign policy was concerned, the whole of his careful structure dashed
to pieces, and the complete triumph of his arch enemy at the battle of
Austerlitz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack on Lord Melville.</div>

<p>If the close of his life as a foreign minister was sad, a still thicker
mist of misfortune hung over the last years of his home
government. The man on whom he most relied in the
ministry was his old friend Lord Melville, who had fairly justified
his confidence by the energy and success with which he had reconstituted
the navy. It was through him that the Opposition found
means to inflict a deadly blow upon the minister. Lord St. Vincent,
though his general administration had been weak, had been
laudably anxious to improve the condition of the Admiralty, especially
<span class="sidenote">Naval inquiries. Feb. 1805.</span> in regard to
its expenses. He had therefore established a commission of naval inquiry,
which from time to time sent in its reports. The last of these, the
tenth, had been sent in in February 1805. Even before its publication
it was understood to reflect upon Lord Melville's conduct as Treasurer
of the Navy, an office which he had held along with several others
in Pitt's first administration. On one point he had certainly shown
remissness. He had allowed Mr. Trotter, Paymaster of the Navy, to pay
public money to his own account at his banker's, and to use it as his
own. No loss had accrued to the State in consequence; but no doubt it
was a highly censurable misapplication of public funds. But beyond this,
it was asserted that Lord Melville had himself acted in a similar way,
and undoubtedly there were certain sums unaccounted for. Lord Melville's
own account of this matter was, that since his retirement from office
he had destroyed all old vouchers; but that even if he possessed them,
as he at that time held various offices, and did not keep the accounts
entirely separate, he would not have been able to give a satisfactory
account without disclosing confidential transactions of Government. This
no doubt meant that the money had been employed for some secret service;
but his enemies did not scruple to say that he had appropriated it to
his own uses. Upon the report Mr. Whitbread founded a parliamentary
attack upon Melville, and gave notice that he would bring in a vote of
censure upon the 8th of April. Government had now to determine what they
would do. Pitt and his own immediate friends, entirely disbelieving the
charge against Melville, resolved to withstand it openly. But there was
a division in his own Cabinet. Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1259" id="Page_1259">[1259]</a></span>
Sidmouth and Melville were great enemies, and, declaring that he
regarded it as impossible for Melville to clear himself, Sidmouth
warned Pitt that if he persisted in defending him he should be
obliged to resign. As this would have been complete ruin, Pitt
yielded to a middle course, and determined to request that the
inquiry might be referred to a select committee. On the 8th the
<span class="sidenote">Vote of censure against Melville. April 8,
1805.</span> great debate came on. It was plain that the question would
rest with the votes of the independent members, and when Wilberforce,
whose character carried great weight, declared that he must support the
vote of censure, those members who were pledged to neither party were
induced to follow his lead. The anxious moment for division arrived, and
the numbers were declared to be equal&mdash;216 having voted on either
side. The Speaker was then called upon to give his casting vote. The
scene is thus described by Lord Fitzharris:&mdash;"I sat wedged close
to Pitt himself the night when we were 216; and the Speaker Abbot,
after looking as white as a sheet, and pausing for ten minutes, gave
the casting vote against us. Pitt immediately put on the little cocked
hat that he was in the habit of wearing when dressed for the evening,
and jammed it deeply over his forehead, and I distinctly saw the tears
trickling down his cheeks. We had heard one or two, such as Colonel
Wardle, say they would see 'how Billy looked after it.' A few young
ardent followers of Pitt, with myself, locked their arms together and
formed a circle, in which he moved, I believe unconsciously, out of the
House, and neither the Colonel nor his friends could approach him." The
Opposition were not content with the vote of censure; although Melville
at once resigned his office, Whitbread proceeded to move an address to
the King that he should be removed from the King's Councils and presence
for ever. The feeling of the House did not justify so extreme a measure,
and the motion was withdrawn. But before long the minister thought it
necessary so far to yield to public opinion as to have Lord Melville's
name withdrawn from the Privy Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sidmouth resigns. July 7.</div>

<p>The disagreement between Pitt and Sidmouth upon Lord Melville's
conduct terminated in the withdrawal of the
Lord President and his followers from the ministry. On
the appointment of Sir Charles Middleton, a very old
man, to the Admiralty, in which he had been the constant assistant
of Melville, Sidmouth took the opportunity of expressing his displeasure
and resigned. The charge against Lord Melville was
pressed to impeachment. He delivered a defence before the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1260" id="Page_1260">[1260]</a></span>
of Commons, but it was not regarded as satisfactory. The House of
Lords were therefore called upon to decide the question, and when
it subsequently came to the vote (June 12, 1806) a very large
majority, on all the charges, declared the prisoner not guilty. But
Pitt did not live to hear either this declaration of the innocence of
his friend or to suffer from the desertion of his colleague Sidmouth.
<span class="sidenote">Parliament prorogued. July 12, 1805.</span> The
impeachment was not carried up to the Bar of the House of Lords till the

not live to see the opening of another session.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the war. 1804.</div>

<p>While misfortune was thus following the minister in Parliament, his
great plans of European policy had been continued and had at last met
with success. In fact, in this matter Napoleon had been his best ally,
and had been gradually forcing the great powers of Europe into hostility.
The ill feeling which had arisen between the Emperor Alexander and
Bonaparte in the preceding year had been increased by subsequent events,
and the Czar had been gradually taking up a position of more defined
hostility. On the 24th of May 1804, he contracted a defensive alliance
with Prussia, though not intending immediate war if it could be avoided.
The murder of the Duc d'Enghien and the violation of neutral territory
had forced him further in the same direction. So strongly had he resented
this act, that it was through his representations to the Diet of Ratisbon
(July) that Austria and Prussia, who would otherwise have passed it
over in silence, were induced to take any notice of it, and at length,
finding his indirect action through the German powers of no avail, he
had remonstrated directly with France and withdrawn his ambassador from
Paris (Aug. 18). Prussia, which pursued throughout a weak and vacillating
policy, also expressed its disapprobation of Napoleon's conduct by a
change of ministry, which removed Haugwitz, a constant friend of France,
from office. But instead of seeking to allay its fears, Napoleon still
further excited its jealousy by intriguing with the smaller States of
Germany, and making a violent inroad into the territory of Hamburg (Oct.
25), to carry off thence the English minister. Austria too, though
restrained by her weakness from overt action, in November contracted a
treaty with Russia similar to that of Prussia. Very little was wanted to
bring all three powers into open hostility with France.</p>

<p>The character of Alexander gave indeed to Napoleon an opportunity
which he ought to have seized. He was full of high-flown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1261" id="Page_1261">[1261]</a></span>
notions for the regeneration of Europe, for the more equitable division
of states, and some generally established system of public law. With
some such scheme his minister Nowosiltzoff came to England in 1805.
Pitt speedily modified his views, and proved to him that before so
grand a scheme could be realized the practical work to be done was
to insist upon the establishment of the terms of the treaties of Lunéville
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of St. Petersburg. April 11, 1805.</span>
and Amiens. Accordingly, on the 11th of April, the Treaty of St.
Petersburg was signed. The two countries pledged themselves to support
a general European league, for the purpose of demanding the evacuation
of Hanover, Italy, and Elba, the real independence of Holland and
Switzerland, and the complete establishment of the kingdom of Naples:
they especially pledged themselves not to interfere with the internal
government of France, and to close all questions by a general European
congress. As England refused to evacuate Malta, the Czar declined to
ratify the treaty, and determined to make one more effort singlehanded to
avoid war. For this purpose he despatched an ambassador with much more
favourable terms than those implied in the late treaty. But Napoleon
declined to see him for two months, and in those two months he had had
himself declared King of Italy (May 26), had accepted the offer of the
Doge of Genoa to comprise the Ligurian Republic in his Italian kingdom
(June 3), had created Lucca into a principality for the husband of his
sister Eliza (July 21), and had received an ambassador from the Court
of Naples with the most stinging threats and insults. The Russian
ambassador was therefore recalled, and, though without declaration of
war, the coalition was in fact in existence, and arrangements for a
general attack <span class="sidenote">The coalition practically formed.
Sept. 1805.</span> upon France began. The coalition was thus the fruit
rather of Napoleon's conduct than of Pitt's diplomacy; the occupation
of Hanover, the violation of the neutral territory of Baden, the murder
of the Duc d'Enghien, the establishment of the kingdom of Italy,
the annexation of Genoa and Lucca, and virtually of Holland and of
Switzerland, supplied ample reasons to excite the alarm of Europe and to
drive the powers into coalition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon prepares to invade England.</div>

<p>But while the coalition was forming, and Napoleon seemed wantonly to
be insulting Europe and ignoring the danger of exciting fresh enemies, he
was in fact urging on with all rapidity his schemes for the invasion of
England, which he probably hoped might be so successful as to paralyse
all action on the part of the European powers. The constantly repeated
representations of his naval officers had forced him, much against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1262" id="Page_1262">[1262]</a></span>
will, to believe that his descent upon England would be impracticable
unless secured by the presence of his fleet. In spite of the general
voice of those who knew the condition of the French navy, he determined
to act with his fleet on the same principles as he would have acted with
his army; a gigantic combination of various squadrons was to be effected,
and a fleet great enough to destroy all hope of opposition to sweep
the Channel. For this purpose the eighteen ships of the line at Brest
under Admiral Gantheaume, the squadron at Rochefort under Villeneuve,
and the Toulon fleet under Latouche-Tréville, were to unite. The last
mentioned admiral was intrusted with the chief command. Sailing up the
coast of France, he was to liberate from their blockade the squadrons
of Rochefort and Brest, and with their combined fleets appear before
Boulogne. But Latouche-Tréville died, and Napoleon intrusted his plans to
Villeneuve. Those plans, all of them arranged without regard to the bad
condition of the French ships, or to the uncertainty of the weather, were
frequently changed; at one time Villeneuve from Toulon, and Missiessy,
his successor, at Rochefort, were to proceed to the West Indies, drawing
the English fleet thither; then Gantheaume was to appear from Brest,
throw troops into Ireland, and thus cover the flotilla. At another time,
all the fleets were to assemble at the West Indies, and, joining with the
Spanish fleet at Ferrol, appear in the Straits of Calais.</p>

<p>To complete this last measure Villeneuve set sail from Toulon
on the 30th of March 1805, joined Gravina at Cadiz, and reached
Martinique on the 13th of May with twenty-eight ships and seven
frigates. His voyage was so slow that Missiessy had returned from
<span class="sidenote">Nelson's pursuit of Villeneuve. May 1805.</span>
the West Indies to France, and the junction failed. In hot pursuit of
Villeneuve, Nelson, who had at length found out his destination, had
hurried. At Martinique Gantheaume, with the Brest fleet, should have
joined Villeneuve; unfortunately for him Admiral Cornwallis blockaded
his fleet. Villeneuve therefore had to return to Europe alone, sailing
for Ferrol to pick up a squadron of fifteen ships. He was then, at the
head of thirty-five ships, ordered to appear before Brest, liberate
Gantheaume, and appear in the Channel. Back again in pursuit of him
Nelson sailed, but supposed that he would return to the Mediterranean and
not to Ferrol; he therefore again missed him; but as he had found means
to inform the English Government that Villeneuve was returning to Europe,
Calder, with a fleet of fifteen ships, was sent to intercept him. The
fleets encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1263" id="Page_1263">[1263]</a></span>
off Cape Finisterre. The French had twenty-seven vessels, Calder but
fifteen, and after an indecisive battle, in which two Spanish ships were
taken, he was afraid to renew the engagement, and Villeneuve was thus
enabled to reach Ferrol in safety. However, all the operations towards
concentration had led to absolutely nothing, and the English fleets,
which the movements towards the West Indies were to have decoyed from
the Channel, were either still off the coast of France or in immediate
pursuit of the fleet of Villeneuve. Nelson returned to Gibraltar, and as
soon as he found out where Villeneuve was, he joined his fleet to that of
Cornwallis before Brest, and himself returned to England.</p>

<p>The day before Calder had also left nine ships with Cornwallis,
who had thus a fleet of thirty-five vessels. He divided them into
two equal parts, sending one to Ferrol, and keeping the other to guard
Gantheaume in Brest. Meanwhile Villeneuve had not been able to get
ready for sea till the 11th of August. Had he then sailed he would
probably have encountered with his own nineteen ships Cornwallis'
fleet of thirty-five vessels off Brest. Had he indeed postponed his
sailing for a few days he would have found Cornwallis' fleet separated,
but even then it was improbable that he would have escaped one or
other of its divisions. But in fact he did not know of its division, and
therefore, acting in the belief of the union of the great fleet off Brest,
he was afraid to venture northwards, and with the full approbation
of his Spanish colleague Gravina, determined to avail himself of a last
<span class="sidenote">Failure of Napoleon's schemes. Aug.</span>
alternative which Napoleon had suggested, and sailed to Cadiz. This
was a fatal blow to the gigantic schemes of Napoleon. Up till the 22nd
of August he still believed that Villeneuve would make his appearance,
and in fact wrote to him that day at Brest, closing his letter with the
words, "England is ours." As the time for his great stroke drew near he
grew nervously anxious, constantly watching the Channel for the approach
of the fleet, and at last, when his Minister of Marine, Decrès, told him
that the fleet had gone to Cadiz, he broke forth in bitter wrath against
both his minister and Villeneuve, whom he accused of the most shameful
weakness.</p>

<p>But Napoleon was not a man who let his success be staked upon
one plan alone. Though studiously hiding from his people the
existence of the coalition, and not scrupling to have recourse to
forged letters and fabricated news for the purpose, he was fully aware
of its existence. He knew too of the movements of the armies of
Austria and Russia, and had already taken some steps to meet them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1264" id="Page_1264">[1264]</a></span>
Without much difficulty, therefore, he at once resigned his great
<span class="sidenote">He changes his plan and marches against
Austria.</span> plans upon England, and directed his army towards the
eastern frontier, determined to wipe out by a great campaign, in which
the chances were all in his favour, the disgrace and ridicule of his
long-threatened but abortive attack upon England. The largest and best
part of the Austrian army was in Italy under the Archduke Charles. On the
Inn there were barely 80,000 men, commanded by General Mack. The Russians
had yet far to go before they could form a junction with the Austrian
troops, and Napoleon, when he first changed his plan on the 25th of
August, intended to march by the most direct route to meet the Austrians,
and if possible prevent them from crossing the Inn. For this purpose he
could bring, counting the army of occupation of Hanover, nearly 200,000
men into the field. The passage of the Rhine was open to him; it was no
longer necessary as of old to fight his way through the Black Forest. By
pursuing a direct course he would be able to pick up the troops who were
in Hanover on his way, and bring his whole army to bear at once upon the
Inn. The Austrians, however, little calculating on the rapidity of his
movements, believing that the army was engaged on the northern coast,
and desirous of securing the assistance of the Bavarian army of 25,000
men, rashly crossed the Inn on the 7th of September, and advanced to Ulm.
Their movements were accurately known to Napoleon, who had sent Murat
in disguise into Bavaria to watch them; and when he heard that they had
taken up their position so far in advance of their base of operations,
he formed his great plan for surrounding and capturing the whole army at
Ulm.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was thus hurrying off to destroy the Austrian
troops, Nelson, having heard of the destination of Villeneuve, and
feeling that the fleet he had so long pursued was his fair prey,
offered his services to Government. They were gladly accepted,
and on the 13th of September he left his home for the last time to
take command of the fleet off Cadiz. Thus, each on its own
element, the two great nations of Europe, commanded by the two
great leaders of the day, were engaged almost simultaneously in
undertakings of the last importance, and almost simultaneously the
results of those undertakings became known. On the 19th of
<span class="sidenote">Capitulation of the Austrian army at Ulm. Oct
19.</span> October, Mack, finding himself surrounded and cut off
from Vienna, with all hope of relief gone, capitulated
at Ulm, and his whole army of 30,000 men laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1265" id="Page_1265">[1265]</a></span>
their arms before the enemy. On the 21st of the same month the English
and French fleets encountered just within sight of Cape Trafalgar,
outside the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Trafalgar. Oct. 21.</div>

<p>The fleet of the English numbered twenty-seven vessels, Villeneuve
had the command of thirty-three, without reckoning five frigates and
two smaller ships. In other respects, in ability of seamanship, and
in knowledge of the management of guns, the English were undoubtedly
superior. Some days before the battle Nelson had conceived and made known
his plan of action. The assault was to be made in two lines; at the
head of one Nelson was himself to break the line in the centre, while
Collingwood led the second to the attack of the rear squadron. The French
were formed in one line, and were sailing in a south-easterly direction.
Nelson's plan was therefore calculated not only to destroy the enemy,
but also to cut off his retreat from Cadiz and the north. This part of
his plan Villeneuve saw through and avoided. He changed the direction of
his line, so that the rear squadron became the leading squadron, and the
road to Cadiz was kept open. In this order, in full sail, with the wind
in their favour, the English attacked and broke the French line. All the
advantages of this well-known man&oelig;uvre were gained, and by half-past
five in the evening, of the thirty-three vessels of the enemy eighteen
were in the hands of the English, eleven with difficulty retreated
towards Cadiz, and four others, which had formed the leading squadron
of the French, were standing out to sea, only to be captured a few days
afterwards by another fleet. But the victory was dearly won. Nelson, who
had appeared as usual with his orders on his coat, had formed a mark for
the riflemen with whom the rigging of the French ships was filled. He
fell early in the action, but lived long enough to hear of his complete
victory. He died thanking God he had done his duty, and even to the last,
mindful of the safety of his fleet, giving orders that it should at once
anchor to await a gale whose approach he had foreseen. The storm came as
he had expected; a considerable part of our prizes was lost, and three of
the French fugitives were wrecked before they reached the port of Cadiz.
Of the whole fleet eight vessels alone escaped, which remained blockaded
in Cadiz till they fell a prey to the Spanish insurgents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Austerlitz. Dec. 2, 1805.</div>

<p>But though the sea thus passed entirely under the command of the
English, though all chance of invasion had disappeared, a crushing
blow upon the Continent shattered for the time all hope of permanent
opposition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1266" id="Page_1266">[1266]</a></span>
advance of Napoleon. The catastrophe at Ulm was followed by a rapid
advance upon Vienna. The wisdom Napoleon had shown in concentrating his
troops for one great and decisive blow at once bore fruit. The army of
Italy was obliged to retreat before the advance of Massena, in time to
defend if possible Austria itself. It was too late even for that, and
it was compelled to withdraw into Hungary, for the Emperor, desirous of
saving the Viennese from the horrors of a siege, had withdrawn with his
troops into Moravia, in the hopes of there meeting the main body of the
Russians whom Alexander was bringing to his succour. Thither Napoleon
pursued him, and there, with his back to the citadel of Brünn, not far
from Olmutz, he brought on the great battle of Austerlitz, and before
the close of the day the forces of the coalition were completely beaten,
losing upon the field 27,000 killed and wounded, 20,000 prisoners, and
133 pieces of cannon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIX_DEATH_OF_PITT" id="EIGHTEEN_SIX_DEATH_OF_PITT"></a>Death of Pitt. Jan. 23, 1806.</div>

<p>While these stirring events had been happening, the health of the
English minister had been sensibly declining. Cheered for a moment by the
news of Trafalgar, clouded though they were by the death of Nelson, the
rapidly-occurring disasters of Ulm and Austerlitz, and the dissolution,
by the Treaty of Presburg, of the coalition he had so laboriously
established, went far to render fatal the disease which was already
threatening him. He returned from Bath, still hoping against hope that he
might be present at the opening of Parliament, withdrew for quiet to his
villa at Putney, and there died on the 23rd of January 1806.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New ministry.</div>

<p>The death of Pitt was followed by the break-up of his Cabinet, which
was not so constituted as to be able to stand without him. The King did
indeed attempt to continue it under the leadership of Lord Hawkesbury;
but upon his refusal to accept the responsibilities of the Premiership,
the King was obliged to have recourse to the Opposition, and to summon
Lord Grenville to his Councils. The admission of Grenville to the
ministry implied the admission of Fox; the close political alliance they
had formed, the determination they had already expressed, when rejecting
Pitt's offers, never to join in any separate arrangements, rendered it
quite impossible for either to accept office without the other. In spite,
therefore, of the King's anger and dislike, he was compelled to admit
his old enemy Fox to the ministry. The basis on which Grenville and Fox
had been united in opposition was the strong belief which both felt that
in the present crisis a ministry of a broad and national character was
required. On this principle they formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1267" id="Page_1267">[1267]</a></span>
their new administration, which was known by the name of "the Ministry
of all the talents." Lord Grenville became First Lord of the Treasury;
Earl Spencer and Mr. Windham, members of Pitt's first administration,
Secretaries for the Home and War departments; Fox became Foreign
Secretary, and his friends Earl Fitzwilliam and Grey (now Lord Howick),
the one Lord President of the Council, and the other First Lord of the
Admiralty. Lord Moira, Master-General of the Ordnance, represented the
friends of the Prince of Wales; while Lord Sidmouth became Lord Privy
Seal, and as he insisted on bringing one friend with him into the
Cabinet, introduced with questionable wisdom Lord Ellenborough, the Lord
Chief Justice. It has since this time been generally held that such a
position is incompatible with high judicial duties. Lord Henry Petty,
afterwards Lord Lansdowne, was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Before the
ministry went out all due honour had been paid to the late minister; a
public funeral and monument had been voted, together with the sum of
£40,000 for the payment of his debts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Fox.</div>

<p>The character of Fox as a statesman was now upon its trial. After
thirty years of exclusion from office, in perpetual opposition to the
King and the general feeling of the upper classes, Fox had at length an
opportunity of proving the justice of the reliance which men of liberal
opinions had always placed in him. Large-hearted, with great warmth of
personal affection, and general love of the human race, he had uniformly
opposed war, had constantly declared that either the mismanagement
or ill-will of the ministers had been the main obstacle to peace: he
had believed devoutly in the excellence of the Revolution, traced its
excesses to the wanton opposition of the crowned heads of Europe,
and still persisted in believing that straightforward and friendly
negotiations would bring about a right understanding with Napoleon. The
brief period which elapsed between his acceptance of office in January
and his death on the 13th of September, sufficed to prove to him the
futility of his hopes; and the ministry found itself obliged to take up
identically the same position as that of their predecessors. Like his
great rival, he closed his life in the midst of the unutterable sadness
caused by the complete frustration of those plans on which, according
to his view, the welfare of his country rested, with this additional
bitterness in his cup that upon him was forced the conviction, not only
that circumstances were too strong for him, but that the optimism which
had been the very breath of his political life rested upon no solid
ground, and that the work to which he had devoted himself, and the
maintenance of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1268" id="Page_1268">[1268]</a></span>
had perpetually debarred him from a share in the government of the
country, had been wholly misdirected. That destruction of illusions
which comes to most men in their youth fell upon him when he was already
breaking with age and disease, and when he must have been conscious that
no time was left him to correct the errors into which he had been led.
It is difficult to conceive a sadder close to a noble political career
than that which fell upon the minister as he discovered too late that the
practical logic of facts contradicted all those high aspirations which
had throughout guided his conduct. So complete, however, was the proof
afforded him by his short ministry of the futility of his hopes, that
his friend Lord Howick, after just a year of office, was compelled to
declare of the late negotiations that "there never was any opportunity
of procuring any such terms as would have been adequate to the just
pretensions and consistent with the honour and interests of this country;
'one thing is clear, the progress of Bonaparte has never yet been stopped
by submission, and our only hope therefore is in resistance, as far as we
can resist his ambitious projects.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations for peace. March.</div>

<p>The negotiations of which Lord Howick thus confessed the disastrous
conclusion were opened by Fox almost immediately after his accession to
office. A few days after his appointment an unknown person called upon
him, and disclosed a plan for the assassination of the Emperor. With
natural indignation, Fox caused the man to be apprehended, and while
warning Bonaparte that the law of England prevented his lengthened
detention, he promised that it should be long enough to enable the
Emperor to provide against the nefarious plan. It is not improbable that
the whole conspiracy was devised by Napoleon himself for the purpose of
opening a negotiation with Fox, in whom he believed he had a sincere
well-wisher, and on whose simple-hearted optimism he believed he could
play. He caused a copy of a speech to reach Fox in which he expressed his
willingness to make peace with England on the stipulations of the Treaty
of Amiens. This led to a direct negotiation between Fox and Talleyrand,
in which the English minister, in accordance with his views, attempted,
as he said, to act upon the assumption that the countries would treat as
two great powers, despising any idea of chicane. But this was not at all
Napoleon's view of negotiation. His diplomacy constantly assumed the same
form&mdash;separate treaties with different members of the coalition, and
the hurried continuance of aggression during the time that negotiations
were pending, so as to compel the treating power either to accept the
aggressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1269" id="Page_1269">[1269]</a></span>
or to break off the treaty. This had been his plan before the Treaty of
Amiens, and this he had just repeated after the battle of Austerlitz.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FIVE_TREATIES_OF_SCHONBRUNN" id="EIGHTEEN_FIVE_TREATIES_OF_SCHONBRUNN"></a>Treaty of Schönbrunn, Dec 15, and Presburg, Dec.
26, 1805.</div>

<p>Prussia was already so far pledged to join the coalition that it was
on the point of receiving the first payment of a subsidy from England.
But Bonaparte succeeded in inducing the vacillating court to break with
both its allies. Two separate treaties were made, one at Schönbrunn, by
which Prussia withdrew from the coalition, and entered into an offensive
and defensive alliance with France, receiving Hanover in exchange for
Anspach, which was to be restored to Bavaria, and the Principality
of Neuchatel, which was to be annexed to France, and the other at
Presburg, in which Austria, having lost all hope of any assistance
Prussia might have rendered, was induced to accept the most disastrous
terms. The kingdom of Italy was to receive Venice and the Adriatic
provinces; the three German powers which were consistently friends of
France&mdash;Bavaria, Wurtemberg and Baden&mdash;obtained portions of the
German dominions of Austria; the royal title was secured to Bavaria and
Wurtemberg; the rights of the Empire over the immediate nobility were
renounced; the reorganization of Italy was admitted; and Austria even
agreed not to interfere in the affairs of Naples. On these terms the
constitution of the Germanic Confederation was guaranteed. It is needless
to point out what a seed of hatred was sown by these treaties, in which
one of the German powers was humiliated by its ignominious bargain, the
other driven almost to despair by the ruthless manner in which it was
pillaged.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this that Pitt died and Fox entered office. There
were left of the coalition England and Russia, with whom Napoleon had
now to deal. Fox felt, as any honourable man must have felt, that it was
his duty to stand by his allies, and to engage only in negotiations in
common with them. Napoleon, on the other hand, pursued his old policy,
and determined to treat separately; but while treating he continued the
work on which he was then engaged&mdash;the erection of a number of
small independent kingdoms and principalities in vassalage to France. In
February and March he overran Naples and established his brother Joseph
as king. In March he ordained a similar fate for Holland, and before June
had established his brother Louis there. Numerous other principalities
were called into existence for his relations and marshals, and the work
was completed by the organization in July of the Confederation of the
Rhine, consisting of Baden, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt, and
several other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1270" id="Page_1270">[1270]</a></span>
smaller states, who acknowledged the protectorate of France, and
promised to keep on foot an army of 63,000 men at Napoleon's
disposal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the negotiations.</div>

<p>While thus proceeding with his aggressions he was treating with
both Russia and England. To the letters of Fox had succeeded personal
negotiations between Talleyrand and Lord Yarmouth, who had been detained
a prisoner after the Peace of Amiens. The terms which were first offered
to Lord Yarmouth show the contempt with which Bonaparte regarded Prussia,
the change in the terms as the treaty continued shows how little
intention there was of really coming to an honest arrangement, should it
prove possible to separate the interests of Russia and England. At first
Talleyrand told Yarmouth that no difficulty would be found in taking
Hanover, which had already been given to Prussia, and restoring it to
England, or in giving Sicily back to the King of Naples. Sicily indeed
Napoleon had not yet conquered; but as the separate treaty with Russia
advanced and became more possible, Yarmouth found the terms changing.
He was told that Sicily was to be conquered and added to the kingdom
of Joseph; and finally, when the treaty with Russia was provisionally
signed, although Yarmouth had been assured that the constitution of
Germany should be unchanged if peace were made, the Confederation of
the Rhine was called into existence. Fox's eyes had been almost opened
by this time. The refusal of Sicily, the separate peace with Russia,
the interference with the constitution of Germany, led him to see that
his friendly negotiations were not likely to lead to much result. He
therefore sent Lord Lauderdale, with fuller authority than Lord Yarmouth,
to re-establish the old basis of negotiation. His complaints were
listened to, but there were no signs of withdrawal on the part of France.
As for the compensation of the King of Naples, it was desirable enough,
but it must not be at the expense of France. He might perhaps have
Albania, which belonged to Turkey, or Ragusa, which belonged to Austria,
or the Balearic Isles, <span class="sidenote">Negotiations broken off.

unpromising situation news arrived that the Czar had entirely rejected
the provisional treaty his minister had signed, and almost immediately
afterwards Fox died. The diplomatic intercourse continued about a month
longer, and was then broken off.</p>

<p>Fox's friends thus learnt the error of their previous views, and the
necessity of carrying on the war with vigour; but Fox's ministry was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1271" id="Page_1271">[1271]</a></span>
not entirely without fruit. As he had himself stated, the second great
object of his life was the abolition of the slave trade. For upwards of
thirty years the horrors of slavery had occupied the minds of a large
<span class="sidenote">Abolition of the slave trade.</span> section of
benevolent men in England. In 1783 the Quakers had petitioned against
the slave trade. From that time till 1788, Clarkson, a young Cambridge
man, had devoted his life to collecting evidence on the horrors of the
trade. He had succeeded in interesting in his cause Pitt, Fox, and,
before all, Wilberforce; and in that year Pitt had brought the matter
before Parliament, and a resolution had been carried to take the slave
trade into consideration. Circumstances and the interests of public
business had prevented Pitt from entering fully into the plans of the
abolitionists, although Wilberforce was constantly urging him to do
so. Still, again and again, in 1792 and 1796, Bills had been carried
in favour of abolition in the House of Commons, though subsequently
defeated in the House of Lords. In 1804, on Pitt's resumption of office,
Wilberforce renewed the question, which had been allowed to slumber by
the Addington Cabinet, and a Bill for abolition, or rather suspension
of the trade for a term of years, was again carried. In the House of
Lords it was again postponed, but Pitt tried what could be done by
a royal proclamation, which was issued to prevent the trade at all
events in the conquered colonies, the possession of which had greatly
increased the trade, so that nearly 60,000 slaves were yearly imported
in British vessels. In February 1805 a larger measure had been rejected
in the House, but on the accession to office of Fox, who was known to
be more enthusiastic on the matter than Pitt had been, the hopes of the
abolitionists rose high. Nor were their hopes disappointed, though the
party against the measure was strong. The West India merchants were all
against it, and a number of Tories, with the King at their head, regarded
slavery as a natural and scriptural institution by no means to be lightly
touched. On the 10th of June 1806, Fox pledged the House of Commons,
almost without opposition, to take measures as speedily as possible for
abolishing the trade. Even in the House of Lords the minister found that
there would be no serious opposition, and determined to produce a Bill
to prohibit the slave trade entirely. This Act prohibited slave trading
from and after the 1st of January 1808, but as the punishments were only
pecuniary, it required a new Bill, introduced by Mr. Brougham in 1811,
making slave trading felony, to secure its final extinction. These Bills
did not abolish slavery, but only the slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1272" id="Page_1272">[1272]</a></span>
trade. Fox did not live to bring in the Bill, but it was produced by
his colleague Lord Howick, afterwards Lord Grey, on the 2nd of
January 1807, and in spite of the opposition of the royal dukes, of
Lord Eldon and of Lord Sidmouth (Feb. 3), the Bill was passed by a
<span class="sidenote">The Abolition Bill passed. March 25, 1807.</span>
majority of sixty-six. When it was brought to the House of Commons (Feb.
23) it met with quite an enthusiastic reception, and was passed by an
overwhelming majority of 283 to 16. The Bill was rapidly hurried through
its other stages, in order that the ministry which had been successful in
passing it might have the honour of completing it; for before the royal
assent was given it was well known that the Grenville ministry had ceased
to exist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of the Grenville ministry.</div>

<p>The cause of this rapid termination to a ministry which had begun
under such good auspices was the attempt again to bring forward the
Catholic claims, against which the King was set with immoveable
obstinacy. Grenville's conduct was dictated by high policy, and in itself
wise, although, if we regard the minister as a mere party politician,
in the last degree indiscreet. As he himself told the King, he and the
majority of the Cabinet thought that in the present critical state of
England it was most necessary to secure content and unanimity at home,
and to be in a condition to use to the full the military capacity of
every class of his Majesty's subjects. For this reason he was desirous
of removing so much of the disabilities both of the Catholics and of the
Dissenters as affected their military position. There seems, however, to
have been some complication in the matter. The Irish Catholics, headed by
Lord Fingal and Mr. O'Connor, were preparing a great petition, demanding
not only change in the army regulations, but the admission of Catholics
to the offices of sheriff and to corporations; and although Grenville was
careful to forestall the presentation of their petition and to avoid all
appearance of compromise, it is probable that his measure was in fact
in some degree a concession to prevent further agitation; besides which
he could not help feeling that the just expectations of the Catholics
had not been satisfied at the Union. By a law passed in Ireland in 1793
the Roman Catholics had been permitted to hold rank in the Irish army
up to the rank of colonel; but certain restrictions had been
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_REJECTION_OF_THE_CATHOLIC_CLAIMS" id="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_REJECTION_OF_THE_CATHOLIC_CLAIMS"></a>Revival of the question of the Catholic claims.</span>
laid on their holding staff appointments. By the Union the two armies of
Ireland and of England had been made one, and the anomaly had therefore
arisen, that officers capable of holding their rank while in Ireland were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1273" id="Page_1273">[1273]</a></span>
incapable of so doing when they came to England. The ministry determined
to remedy this glaring anomaly, and at the same time to remove the
disabilities which tended to exclude the English Dissenters from the
army. For that purpose a clause was added to the Mutiny Bill of the
year. Some of the High Tories in Parliament, such as Lord Eldon and
Mr. Perceval, thought it unnecessary, and the King's friends, as Lord
Sidmouth and Ellenborough were called, offered some opposition, but on
the whole the proposal was regarded as reasonable. The intention was
notified to the Viceroy in Ireland, and the King himself was finally
induced to consent, at the same time declaring that he would not allow
any further step in the matter. The question then arose in Ireland as
to whether the new clause retained the restrictions as to rank or not,
and the majority of the Cabinet determined that they were removed, and
that the whole army and navy were thrown open to the Catholics. This
determination was laid before the King, and for some reason or other he
took no notice of it, conduct which the ministers (although the Bill
undoubtedly exceeded what the King had already accepted) construed as
giving the royal consent. It was then thought better to make a separate
Bill instead of merely adding a clause to the Mutiny Act; Lord Howick
took the Bill to the King, and understood that he had his consent. But
meanwhile Lord Sidmouth had had interviews with the King, and attempted
to rouse his fears, and for the same purpose had sent in his resignation.
Even more than this, Lord Malmesbury and the Duke of Portland thought
they saw an opening for dislodging the ministry, and between them
concocted a letter, exaggerating the difficulties of the situation,
and containing an offer on the part of the Duke of Portland to form a
ministry according to the King's wishes. Thus, apparently alarmed as
to what he was doing, and feeling his hands strengthened by the Duke's
offer, the King sent for the ministers, and told them he did not agree
to anything beyond the completion of the Act of 1793. As soon as this
determination of the King was known, the conduct of all Pitt's friends
was fixed, and although they were at that moment thinking of joining the
ministry, they now expressed their determination to oppose the Bill;
the whole party felt itself bound by Pitt's promise that the question
should never be moved; so strong was this feeling that even the ministry
expressed themselves willing to drop their Bill. But in dropping it
they were guilty of a most impolitic act. They drew up a minute of the
Cabinet, reserving to themselves the right of avowing their sentiments if
the petition from the Catholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1274" id="Page_1274">[1274]</a></span>
which was at that time in preparation, was presented, and of submitting
to the King from time to time such measures as they deemed advisable
for the good of the country. Upon this the King demanded from them a
withdrawal of their minute, and a written declaration that they would
never offer him any advice upon the <span class="sidenote">The Grenville
ministry resigns. March 18.</span> subject of Catholic concession. It
was of course impossible for any constitutional ministers to give such a
pledge; and it was upon this point&mdash;a point of real constitutional
importance&mdash;that the Cabinet were dismissed. On the 19th of March
the Duke of Portland received orders to form a ministry in consultation
with Lord Chatham. The health of the Duke was such that his Premiership
could be little more than nominal. Indeed, from the first he suffered
Lords Hawkesbury and Eldon in fact to supersede him, and when Mr.
Perceval became Chancellor of the Exchequer he virtually assumed the
lead of the new administration. Canning became Foreign Secretary, Lord
Hawkesbury Home Secretary, and Castlereagh Secretary for War and the
Colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitutional importance of the question.</div>

<p>We have here, then, the final triumph of the policy of George III.
It was again his personal wish which overthrew the ministry, it was
again the underhand intrigues of those professing to be his friends
which strengthened his hands in doing so, and we again find such
things mentioned as that the nephews of the Duke of Portland had had
his distinct orders to vote against the ministers' Bill should it be
produced. The same exercise of prerogative that secured the ministry of
Pitt and supported the feeble ministry of Addington now again introduced
into the ministry men entirely after the King's own heart&mdash;pledged
to oppose the great Liberal measures of the day, and, say what they
would, really answerable for the unconstitutional pledge the King had
demanded from his late ministry. The conduct of the incoming ministry
was not allowed to pass without comment. Attempts were made in both
Houses to establish two points of constitutional law now absolutely
received&mdash;first, that it is contrary to the first duties of the
confidential servants of the Crown to restrain themselves by any pledge,
expressed or implied, from offering to the King any advice which the
course of circumstances may render necessary for the welfare and security
of the Empire; and, secondly, that it was impossible for the King to act
without advice. In upholding this last point, Sir Samuel Romilly asserted
that there could be no exercise of prerogative in which the King could
act without some advice. No constitutional doctrine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1275" id="Page_1275">[1275]</a></span>
more important than this, for without it the King, who theoretically
can do no wrong, would be answerable for his own acts. On a motion by
Mr. Brand supporting these doctrines, the Opposition thought themselves
secure of a majority. But so great was the royal influence, so strong
the Protestant feeling of the country, that they found themselves in a
minority of more than thirty. A dissolution of Parliament followed on the
27th of April. And as the King, in the speech with which Parliament was
closed, appealed as it were to the constituencies for the vindication
of his conduct, the personal loyalty of the people, combined with their
attachment to the old cry of Church and State, placed the ministry in
possession of a majority which secured its permanence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuation of the war. 1806.</div>

<p>During the last days of the Grenville ministry it had been compelled
to pursue the warlike policy of its predecessors, and had exhibited an
incapacity which might have been expected from so mixed a body acting
upon compulsion, and in contradiction to its preconceived ideas of
policy. The renewed war which at once followed upon the cessation of the
negotiations undertaken by Fox was on this occasion directed towards a
new enemy. We have seen the contempt with which Bonaparte habitually
regarded Prussia: his conduct seems to have been wilfully directed to
drive that country into war, and it is interesting to observe that it
was this unjustifiable conduct which gave the first obvious proof of
the changed character of his policy, and roused that animosity, not
of the Court, but of the people assaulted, which finally caused his
ruin. All his late acts had tended to the detriment of Prussia. By the
Confederation of the Rhine the constitution of Germany, in which Prussia
might at all events have claimed some voice, was entirely changed;
French fortifications had been raised on the German side of the Rhine
at Mayence, and the fortress of Wesel had been re-established; the very
bribe with which the apparent friendship of Prussia had been secured had
been tampered with. Hanover, which in the winter had been given in full
possession to Prussia, was in June without scruple offered to England; as
a sort of counterpoise to the Rhenish Confederation, the King of Prussia
had been invited by Napoleon to form a Confederation of the North; but he
soon found how illusory the offer was, for he was everywhere practically
thwarted by the diplomacy of the French. The people even more than the
Court had smarted under the disgrace of the Treaty of Schönbrunn; and
when Napoleon showed the temper in which he intended to interfere in
Germany,&mdash;by the apprehension (in a neutral town which chanced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1276" id="Page_1276">[1276]</a></span>
be occupied by French troops) of the bookseller Palm, and his cold-blooded
murder on the charge merely of selling a book exciting the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIX_PRUSSIA_DECLARES_WAR" id="EIGHTEEN_SIX_PRUSSIA_DECLARES_WAR"></a>Prussia declares war with France. Oct. 1,
1806.</span> national feeling of Germany,&mdash;the popular anger grew
so high, that the King of Prussia was obliged to act with some energy,
especially when the young Queen put herself prominently forward as the
leader of the national war party. A declaration of war with France was
the consequence.</p>

<p>But it was too late to be of any use. The French army, considerably
more numerous than any troops Prussia could bring against it, was already
in Franconia, a few marches from the frontier. There was no time to put
to good account the strong national feeling which had been excited.
Prussia could rely upon its army alone, and though strong in the military
reminiscences of the Great Frederick and admirably appointed, the
Prussian troops had never seen war; the generals were old men wedded to
obsolete traditions, while the King, in his anxiety to please Napoleon,
had even gone so far as to discharge <span class="sidenote">Mismanagement
of Prussia.</span> many of his troops in the previous year. The
consequence of an encounter between such an army and the veterans of
Napoleon might have been foreseen. The catastrophe was hastened by the
bad arrangements of the generals. The King and his Court and crowds of
enthusiastic nobility were with the army, but the chief command was in
the hands of the Duke of Brunswick, an old man past seventy. Anxious to
incorporate the troops of Hesse-Cassel, he repeated the error of the
Austrians of the previous year, and advancing far beyond the Elbe, which
forms the only good line of defence of which Prussia can boast, he took
up a position between Eisenach and Weimar, covered by the Thuringian
Forest, behind which the French could make any dispositions for the
assault they pleased. The mistake was much too obvious to escape the
eyes of Napoleon. His army passed rapidly through the defiles which lead
to the upper waters of the Saal, and proceeding down the course of that
river, interposed themselves between Brunswick and the Elbe. Perceiving
too late his false position, the Duke attempted to withdraw towards
Magdeburg. With the larger portion of his army he found himself stopped
near Auerstadt as he approached Naumbourg on the Saal, by the division of
Davoust, while the Prince of Hohenlohe, with a smaller division
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Jena. Oct. 14, 1806.</span> of the army,
who was to have followed him, was fallen upon and overwhelmed at Jena
by Napoleon himself with the greater part of his army. Beaten back from
Auerstadt, Brunswick retired towards Weimar, only to meet the fugitives
of Hohenlohe's army and their victorious pursuers. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1277" id="Page_1277">[1277]</a></span>
troops were involved in the disaster, the whole Prussian army was broken
and destroyed, and that one day's defeat drew with it the destruction of
the monarchy. Such fugitive detachments as still kept together were one
by one destroyed, and Napoleon entered Berlin in triumph (Oct. 27).</p>

<p>The temporary annihilation of Austria at Austerlitz, and the complete
overthrow of Prussia at Jena, had made Napoleon master of
nearly the whole of Europe. Nothing is more remarkable than the
rapid expansion of his ambition; each new success seemed to supply
him with a new starting-point for further schemes. His mind, in spite
of its practical character, had a strong tendency towards romance;
as in his youth he had been fired with the idea of a great Eastern
monarchy, so now, as circumstances had been favourable to him, the
idea of repeating the rôle of Charlemagne, and the re-establishment
of the Empire of the West, seems to have been prominent in his mind.
Already, in his dealings with the Pope, in the Confederation of the
Rhine, and in the creation of vassal kingdoms, he had shown his
wish to imitate the conduct of that great ruler. The idea was confirmed
by the conquest of Prussia, and strengthened by a petition
from one of his armies that he would take the title of Emperor of
the West. Russia was the only opponent left upon the Continent.
If Russia could be either conquered or won over, not only would he
have been in truth the Western Emperor, but he would have the
means, as he believed, of wreaking his vengeance upon his detested
rival England, which still refused to yield to his ascendancy. Already
<span class="sidenote">The Berlin Decree. Nov. 21, 1806.</span> in
fact, he believed that this vengeance was in his grasp. On the 21st of
November he issued the extraordinary measure known as the Berlin Decree.
Even during the negotiations with Fox he had insisted upon Prussia
closing against English traffic the mouths of the Elbe and Weser. The
measure had not been a success, 400 Prussian vessels had been seized in
reprisal, and the mouths of the North German rivers declared in a state
of blockade. That blockade had been real. But the Emperor now, as he said
by a just use of the law of retaliation (while he was unable with safety
to place a single ship upon the ocean), declared that the whole of the
British Isles were in a state of blockade, forbad on the part of all his
dependent countries any commerce or correspondence with them, declared
every subject of England found in a country occupied by French troops a
prisoner of war, and all English merchandise, even all private property
of Englishmen, confiscated. Thus was established what is known as the
Continental system. It laboured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1278" id="Page_1278">[1278]</a></span>
under three disadvantages. In the first place, it was absolutely
impracticable, Europe could not be supplied without England, as Napoleon
himself found in the course of the year when he authorized the clothing
of his own army with English cloth; secondly, it enabled England by
retaliatory measures to destroy every mercantile marine in Europe except
its own; thirdly, it was so distressing and vexatious, and interfered
so wantonly both with private property and the supply of necessaries
for the people, that, more than anything else that Napoleon did, it
excited popular indignation against him, and tended to his downfall. And
yet it was not without a certain plausible excuse, which rested on the
difference then existing between the laws of war as carried on by land
and upon the sea. By land the property of an enemy was not considered
lawful prize unless it belonged to the hostile government itself; by
sea the property of peaceable merchants was liable to seizure and
confiscation. By land no one was considered a prisoner of war unless
taken with arms in his hand; by sea the crews of merchantmen were
imprisoned as well as those of armed vessels. The second point which
formed Napoleon's excuse was the extension given by England to the right
of blockade. These two points afforded the pretext under which the Decree
was promulgated, and was declared to be a fundamental law of the French
Empire, till England should recognize the laws of war to be the same by
sea and by land, and should consent to restrict the right of blockade
to fortified towns actually invested by a sufficient force. In issuing
his Decree, then, Napoleon put on a specious appearance of magnanimity,
and took upon himself the part which he was fond of assuming, that of
champion of the rights of nations against the tyranny of the English.</p>

<p>The necessity under which England as a belligerent lay of employing
to the full the power which usage gave it of necessity inflicted
considerable inconvenience upon neutral powers. The retaliatory measures
which the Government thought it wise to take still further injured the
neutrals, and threatened almost to <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_THE_ORDERS_IN_COUNCIL" id="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_THE_ORDERS_IN_COUNCIL"></a>Orders in
Council.</span> annihilate the American trade. A series of orders in
Council was issued, extending from January to November 1807. By the first
of these orders vessels were forbidden to trade between any ports in
the possession of France, or of her allies if under her control. By the
second, issued in November, after the extension of the Continental system
to the Mediterranean, general reprisals were granted against the goods,
ships, and inhabitants of Tuscany, Naples, Dalmatia, and the Ionian
Islands. By the third,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1279" id="Page_1279">[1279]</a></span>
all ports from which the flag of England was excluded were declared
in blockade, all trade in their produce unlawful, and their ships a
prize, while all vessels carrying certificates of origin (a measure which
Napoleon had insisted upon to prevent evasion of his system) were
declared liable to capture. By the fourth, another plan of evasion
was forbidden; the sale of ships by a belligerent to a neutral was
declared illegal, because the French had managed to preserve much
of their commerce by fictitious sales, enabling them to continue their
business under neutral flags. The Americans were the chief sufferers
<span class="sidenote">Their effect on America.</span> by these
orders, and the irritation already felt by them was so increased that
it ultimately ripened into war. Their two special grievances were the
constant search of their vessels for deserters, and the refusal of the
British authorities to recognize their customhouse arrangements. By the
English law as then existing an English subject could not get rid of
his nationality. But America was full of English and Irish emigrants
and deserters from English ships, and the Americans had the constant
mortification of seeing even their war-ships stopped and searched, and
the asylum of their flag violated by the apprehension, under the rough
justice of English naval officers, of many of their best seamen. By the
neutral laws direct trading between the colony of a belligerent and its
mother country was forbidden, but neutrals might trade for their own
supply with the colonies. More than this, if they imported from the
colonies more than they wanted they might re-export it even to the mother
country; the proof of a <i>bona fide</i> interrupted voyage was the payment
of the customhouse dues in the ports of the neutral. But these dues were
in America paid not in money but in bonds, which were cancelled when the
goods were re-exported. The payment of goods was therefore fictitious,
and English officials refused to recognize them. The irritation produced
by these two causes was but slightly allayed by negotiations in 1809,
and, as will be subsequently mentioned, the people, especially the
Southerners, forced the States into war in 1812.</p>

<p>To enable Napoleon to carry out his idea either of a Western
Empire or of the complete annihilation of English trade it was
necessary that war with Russia should continue. As a means for
injuring that power he had already held out hopes of restoration of
liberty to Poland, and in December he was received as a national
saviour at Warsaw; but some remnant of the Prussian army had
formed a junction with the forces of the Czar, and Benigsen, in command
of the combined armies, refused to give the French a resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1280" id="Page_1280">[1280]</a></span>
time in their new quarters. Napoleon had again himself to take the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Eylau. Feb. 7, 1807.</span> field. The
allies fell back northwards to Eylau, not far from Königsberg, and there,
on the 7th of February, was fought a great battle, which, for almost the
first time, the French could not claim as a victory. Their exhaustion
was great. Three times within seven months fresh conscriptions had been
ordered in France. The firmness of the Russians at Eylau gave rise to
well-grounded hopes that the chance of checking Napoleon had arrived, but
money and reinforcements of troops were sorely wanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incapacity of the Grenville ministry.</div>

<p>But at this critical moment the Grenville ministry exhibited to the
full its incapacity for carrying on war. The Emperor of Russia was told
that he need expect no great assistance from England, and money was
doled out to him with ridiculous parsimony. There was indeed in England
a total misapprehension of the necessities of a great war. Since the
time of Marlborough and Queen Anne the idea of war on a large scale,
except upon the sea, seemed to have wholly disappeared from the minds of
the public men of the country. Even the great successes of Chatham had
depended principally upon his good fortune in securing the alliance of
Frederick the Great, and now all the resources of England were frittered
away in a ridiculous series of small expeditions. When a concentration of
troops and a frank and open-handed assistance to its allies might have
saved Europe, the English Government taught them by its conduct, that
while urging them to fight it would practically desert them at the moment
when its assistance was wanted, and spend its men and money on such
frivolous expeditions as the attack on Buenos Ayres, Alexandria, or upon
the Dardanelles. These were the three military projects of the Grenville
ministry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to Buenos Ayres. May 1807.</div>

<p>In 1806 the English had recaptured from the Dutch the Cape of Good
Hope. Sir Home Popham, who commanded the fleet, without orders from
Government, determined upon a similar assault upon the Spanish colonies
in America, and proceeded to capture Buenos Ayres. He thence wrote home
a triumphant letter calling upon the English merchants to come to the
magnificent new market he had opened. His triumph was of short duration.
The colonists rallied under command of a French colonel, the city was
recaptured, and the troops compelled to surrender as prisoners of war. In
February 1807, 3000 men were sent out under Sir Samuel Auchmuty to assist
Popham. Too late to save Buenos Ayres, he attacked and captured Monte
Video. Before his success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1281" id="Page_1281">[1281]</a></span>
was known fresh reinforcements were sent out under General Whitelocke,
with orders to assume the chief command, and with Popham's forces
recapture Buenos Ayres. The attempt was a disgraceful failure; the troops
were ordered to enter the city with unloaded muskets, and to rendezvous
in the central square. The effect of so strange an attempt at street
fighting may be easily conjectured. From the side-streets, housetops,
and barricades thrown up across the roads, a destructive fire was kept
up. Though Auchmuty met with some success, by nightfall 2500 of the
English were either killed or prisoners, and Whitelocke was glad to
accept the freedom of the prisoners both of the present engagement and of
the past year, and to withdraw his troops, surrendering Monte Video and
all he had conquered. In the judgment of the court martial which tried
Whitelocke he was held totally unfit to serve his Majesty in any military
capacity whatever, and the popular voice changed his name to General
Whitefeather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey declares war against Russia.</div>

<p>During the continuance of the great European war the friendship of
Turkey had been a constant object with the great powers. The ambassadors
from Russia, France, and England had used all their powers of persuasion
and menace to secure the adhesion of the Sultan. Before the end of
the year 1806 the threats of Russia had had the effect of driving the
Sultan to the friendship of France, and the Porte had declared war with
Russia just after the battle of Jena. Wanting his troops for the defence
of his own country, and being at that time in close friendship with
England, Alexander requested the English Government to take charge of his
interests at the Turkish capital, and <span class="sidenote">Expedition

give up his friendship with France. The plan, being one which could be
carried out by the navy, suited the policy of the Grenville Government,
and orders were sent to Lord Collingwood, then cruising off Cadiz, to
send a squadron to the Dardanelles. He was not allowed to choose his own
commander, but received orders from home to appoint Sir John Duckworth.
Nothing could be worse managed than the expedition. Collingwood had given
strict charge to Duckworth not to be drawn into negotiations. But when
the passage of the Dardanelles, at that time almost unfortified, was
forced, Duckworth, forgetful of Collingwood's advice, suffered himself
to be entangled in negotiations. Sebastiani, the French ambassador,
aroused the temper of the Turks, and instructed them in the best manner
of fortifying their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1282" id="Page_1282">[1282]</a></span>
coasts. The English fleet was in danger of being shut up in the Straits.
It became necessary to withdraw; but that step was no longer easy. On the
1st of March the fleet sailed back through the Dardanelles. Batteries had
been erected at every point, and though the fleet succeeded in running
the gauntlet through the terrible fire, with the loss of only some 300
men, it found itself entirely prevented from any return. The object of
the expedition had completely failed, and the only resource left was to
keep the Turkish fleet blockaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to Alexandria. March to August.</div>

<p>In connection with this expedition a body of troops had been
despatched under General Fraser to capture Alexandria. It was hoped
that on the receipt of the news of Duckworth's expected success, it
would have been able to advance to the reconquest of Egypt. Want of
food necessitated an attack upon Rosetta. It was undertaken in the same
foolish spirit as Whitelocke's attack upon Buenos Ayres. Entangled in
the streets, the English soldiery were shot down in great numbers, and
with the loss of a third of his troops the general in command withdrew
to Alexandria. A subsequent effort was made to besiege Rosetta in form,
but the forces of the Pasha of Egypt proved too strong for the besiegers;
with heavy loss they withdrew to Alexandria, and in August 1807 were
compelled to evacuate the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIX_EXPEDITION_TO_SICILY" id="EIGHTEEN_SIX_EXPEDITION_TO_SICILY"></a>Expedition to Sicily. July, 1806.</div>

<p>The only gleam of success which attended the military operations of
the Grenville ministry was gained in the south of Italy. It will be
remembered that immediately after the battle of Austerlitz the kingdom
of Naples had been appropriated by France. Sicily, however, was not
conquered, and in that island there was an English army commanded by Sir
John Stewart. Urged to do something for the assistance of the Neapolitan
Court, he landed in Calabria in July, and there fought and won the battle
of Maida, in which the French general Reynier was completely beaten. The
forces at Stewart's command were insufficient for the reconquest of the
country, which fell again into French hands on the retirement of the
English, after a lengthened opposition on the part of the peasantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_DISSOLUTION_OF_THE_THIRD_COALITION" id="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_DISSOLUTION_OF_THE_THIRD_COALITION"></a>Complete dissolution of the coalition.</div>

<p>The attempt made at the Peace of Westphalia to establish the balance
of power in Europe, and to secure the rights of small states, had proved
unsuccessful. It had been rudely shocked by the career of Frederick II.,
and almost annihilated by the partition of Poland. A spirit of jealousy
and a desire for selfish aggrandizement had taken possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1283" id="Page_1283">[1283]</a></span>
great reigning houses, and had proved a fatal obstacle to the formation
of loyal coalitions for a general purpose. It is to this that may be
traced the failure of united effort in the last war, and the terrible
reverses which both Austria and Prussia had undergone; England had in the
same spirit just been frittering away its strength in attempts to secure
the mastery of the sea, and the opening of new markets for her trade;
thus left without the assistance they had a right to demand, the Russians
were completely defeated at the battle of Friedland (June 14). It was now
the turn for Russia to seek its own ends, and to secure them by deserting
its allies. Disgusted with the lukewarm assistance afforded by England,
attached to the principles of the Armed Neutrality, and eager to carry
on its schemes of aggression against Turkey, the Czar allowed himself to
be dazzled by the flattering offers of Napoleon. The Emperor had found
his difficulties increase with his empire; he had discovered that the
Russians were more difficult to conquer than the Austrians or Prussians,
and he was now willing to purchase the friendship of the Czar and his
assistance against England by an arrangement by which Alexander should
be Emperor of the East, while he kept for himself the envied position of
Emperor of the West.</p>

<p>The meeting between the Emperors took place, as upon neutral ground,
on a raft in the middle of the Niemer at Tilsitt. "I hate the English as
you do," Alexander is reported to have said. "Then," replied Napoleon,
"peace is made;" and the two Emperors set to work to arrange Europe
according to their own fancies, upon the common basis of dislike to
England, and under the showy pretext of checking her overweening pride
upon the sea. As Russia was fighting not <span class="sidenote">Treaty of
Tilsitt. July 7, 1807.</span> for herself but for her allies, a treaty of
peace and amity was all that was wanted between her and France, and of
course the lately conquered King of Prussia had to pay the price of the
treaty, the terms being chiefly in favour of France. Prussia was deprived
of all its provinces between the Rhine and the Elbe, and of its Polish
possessions. The former were incorporated with Hesse, Brunswick, and a
part of Hanover, to form a kingdom of Westphalia, which was given to
Jerome Bonaparte; the latter were formed into the Grand Duchy of Warsaw,
and given to the King of Saxony, one province only excepted, which was
given to Russia, nominally to cover the expenses of the war. All the
alterations which Napoleon had effected in Europe were accepted; the
Duchies of Oldenburg and Mecklenburg were restored to their possessors,
on the condition that the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1284" id="Page_1284">[1284]</a></span>
should hold their ports till the conclusion of a general peace; Silesia
and the German provinces on the right bank of the Elbe were restored
to Prussia, but a military road was allowed to Saxony through Silesia,
to afford the Saxon Prince access to his new dominions. Prussia was,
however, to acknowledge the Berlin Decree, to reduce its troops to 42,000
men, to pay France £6,000,000 of money, in addition to the charges of
the war, amounting to about £20,000,000, and to leave Berlin and its
chief fortresses in the hands of the French till the debt was paid; as
the yearly revenue of Prussia was not much more than £3,000,000, this
promised to be for some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret articles of the treaty.</div>

<p>But the real point of the treaty was its secret articles, which were
dimly suspected at the time, and the existence of which has subsequently
been fully proved. By these articles, if England had not consented by
the 1st of November to conclude peace&mdash;recognizing that the flags
of all Powers ought to enjoy an equal and perfect independence on the
seas, and restoring all conquests won from France or its allies since
1805&mdash;Russia was to make common cause with France against her, and
oblige the Courts of Lisbon, Stockholm and Copenhagen to join in the
alliance. In exchange for this, which was to wreak Napoleon's vengeance
upon England, it was stipulated that if the Porte did not accept the
mediation of France, France would make common cause with Russia against
the Porte, and would agree to take from the Turks all the provinces
of the Ottoman Empire in Europe, with the exception of the town of
Constantinople and Roumelia. Napoleon had thus thrown over, for his own
advantage, the Poles, on whose hopes of liberty he had traded, and the
Turks, whom he had induced to declare war with Russia; Spain and Portugal
were left open to his ambition; Sweden was placed at the disposal of
Russia, which was likewise rid of all difficulty from Poland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of Alexander.</div>

<p>The conduct of Alexander has an appearance of extreme treachery. Only
a few days before he had written to the English King that "there was
no salvation to himself or to Europe but by interminable resistance to
Bonaparte;" moreover, he did not refuse to accept a considerable portion
of the territories of his ally the King of Prussia. His apologists assert
that his readiness to accept Napoleon's terms was assumed to afford him
an opportunity for strengthening himself for future opposition to French
aggrandizement. More probably he was led away, partly by his peculiar
enthusiastic temperament, which made him wish to have a large share both
in the establishment of peace and in the rearrangement of Europe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1285" id="Page_1285">[1285]</a></span>
partly by an undercurrent of ambition which laid him open to offers
securing him the acquisition of Poland, and the command both of the
Baltic and the Black Seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequences of the Peace of Tilsitt.</div>

<p>Already, before the signing of the Peace of Tilsitt, information
had been brought to Canning, our Foreign Minister, that the fleets of
Portugal and Denmark were to be taken by the French and used for an
assault upon England. The secret articles of the treaty vindicate the
truth of this information, and justify in some degree the immediate
action which the English Government took upon it. For although there
seems to be proof that the Danes themselves were anxious to maintain
their friendship with England, it was more than probable that they would
be unable to resist the combined pressure of Russia and France. Refusing
the mediation offered by Russia, unless England was put on a fair footing
with France by a frank disclosure of the nature of the late treaty,
the English Government despatched a squadron to require the immediate
surrender of the Danish fleet. It was no doubt a harsh measure, rendered
still harsher by the courageous conduct of the Danes. Although Copenhagen
was unprepared for an attack, the demand was refused, and it was found
necessary to <span class="sidenote">Capture of the Danish fleet. Sept. 8.</span>
bombard the city. The effect of this step was, on the one hand, a
surrender of the whole Danish fleet, which was brought to England, and
on the other, to make Denmark, whatever its previous intention may have
been, a close ally of France. In a second direction the consequences of
the treaty became immediately obvious. Russia demanded of Sweden her
adhesion to the Continental System. Christian IV., the king of that
<span class="sidenote">War between Russia and Sweden. Oct. 31.</span>
country, was chivalrous and impetuous to the verge of madness. He refused
all solicitations to forsake his alliance with England, and became
entangled in a war with France and Russia at once. When scarcely strong
enough to defend his own country, he began an assault upon the Danish
province of Norway, and consequently lost all his territory in Pomerania
and Finland, which amounted to nearly a third of his kingdom. Sir John
Moore, with an army of 10,000 men, were sent to his assistance, but found
him so wild and unreasonable that he thought it better to sail home
without even landing his troops. Frightened at the eccentricities of
their sovereign, the Swedes removed him from the throne, setting up his
uncle in his place.</p>

<p>In the North, then, the Treaty of Tilsitt had produced the effect
which Napoleon had desired. Advantage had been taken of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1286" id="Page_1286">[1286]</a></span>
bombardment of Copenhagen, which was held to be a fresh proof
<span class="sidenote">Continental System acknowledged everywhere except
in Portugal.</span> of the lawless ambition of England, to oblige
Austria, Russia, and Prussia all to declare war with England. Denmark
had joined the French alliance, Sweden had been compelled to forego the
friendship of England. But there still existed one part of Europe where
the Berlin Decree was unacknowledged, and the blockade of the British
Isles was thus incomplete; this country was Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of the Peninsula.</div>

<p>Napoleon had long had his eyes fixed upon the Peninsula; by the
Treaty of Tilsitt it had in fact been delivered into his hands as
Finland into the hands of Alexander. The condition of the Peninsula was
very favourable to his schemes. Charles IV., a weak old man, was on
the throne, governed by his wife and by her favourite minister Godoy,
the Prince of the Peace. In strong opposition to his father and to the
Queen was Ferdinand, the Prince of Asturias. Both parties intrigued
for the support of Napoleon, but Godoy had been able to offer the more
tempting bait. Napoleon had induced the Prince of Asturias to enter into
communication with regard to a marriage with a lady of the Bonaparte
family. The secret correspondence had been brought to the knowledge of
the King, and made use of by him and his minister to affix a charge
of treason upon the Prince, and to imprison him for having conspired
to drive his father from the throne. By the people the story of the
conspiracy was regarded as a calumny of the minister to destroy the
Prince, and fearful of the storm he had excited, Godoy now attempted to
mediate a reconciliation between the King and his son. The Prince in
his imprisonment was induced to write penitential letters, and a solemn
pardon was given. But though the attempt to remove the Prince had thus
failed, Godoy's own connection with Napoleon, who had probably been
at the bottom of the late affair, was almost immediately shown by the
publication, on the 29th of October, of the Treaty of Fontainebleau. This
treaty disclosed the bait with which Godoy had been enabled to secure the
alliance of Bonaparte. He suggested that France and Spain should join
in appropriating Portugal if only he were allowed a principality out of
the spoil. The house of Braganza was to be dispossessed; the northern
province of Portugal was to be given to the King of Etruria,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> whose own province,
Tuscany, might thus be appended to the Italian kingdom; Godoy
was to be rewarded with the principality of Alentejo and Algarves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1287" id="Page_1287">[1287]</a></span>
Some excuse was of course wanted for this wanton attack upon Portugal.
It was found in the way in which the Court of Lisbon obeyed the
demand addressed to it after the Peace of Tilsitt, to close <span
class="sidenote">Napoleon's pretext for war with Portugal.</span> the
ports of Portugal against England, to detain all Englishmen resident
in Portugal, and to confiscate all English property. Meanwhile all
Portuguese merchant ships in the ports of France were to be detained. The
Prince Regent of Portugal was not strong enough to resist the demand.
He obeyed the first order, without however forfeiting the friendship of
England, which confessed the coercion laid upon him. To the other two
demands he also at length conceded, but not till he had given plentiful
warning to the English to withdraw and to sell their property. The delay
was, however, sufficient to afford Napoleon the pretext he wanted.</p>

<p>While negotiations were still proceeding with Portugal, the real
intention of the Emperor&mdash;to appropriate both that country and
Spain&mdash;became obvious. For this purpose nearly 30,000 French
troops were to enter Spain, and 40,000 more were assembled at
Bayonne. While Junot, with "the first army of the Gironde,"
<span class="sidenote">Junot's army enters Spain. Oct. 18.</span>
poured through Salamanca (in October 1807), and proceeded to the conquest
of Portugal, the domestic quarrels of the Spanish Court continuing, the
40,000 men assembled at Bayonne moved in two armies into Spain, and
while apparently preparing to follow Junot, really occupied the
line of mountains north of Madrid, and cut off that capital
<span class="sidenote">Ferdinand VII. succeeds his father Charles IV.
March 19, 1808.</span> from the northern provinces, which were thus
practically conquered without a blow. In March 1808 riots both in Madrid
and Aranjuez, ending in the abdication of Charles and the accession of
Ferdinand, gave the French, now under the command of Murat,
<span class="sidenote">Murat occupies Madrid. March 23.</span> an excuse
for crossing the mountains by the Pass of Somo Sierra and occupying
Madrid. By a series of shameless intrigues Napoleon attracted both
Ferdinand and his father to Bayonne. Ferdinand was there induced to
restore <span class="sidenote">Napoleon places Joseph on the throne.</span>
the crown to his father (May 5), who abdicated a second time,
placing the crown in the hands of Napoleon. Napoleon immediately
established his brother Joseph upon the vacant throne (June 15).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection in Spain.</div>





<p>But the Spaniards, especially the Castilians, were a people of high
temper; in spite of a century's degradation, certain remembrances of a
former greatness hung about them. They saw with scorn and disgust the
treacherous conduct of their own rulers, who were handing them over, bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1288" id="Page_1288">[1288]</a></span>
hand and foot, to a foreign prince, whose very virtues rendered him
doubly detestable to them; for the rule of the French meant splendid
and centralized organization, restraint, self-denial, and wise government,
very much opposed to Spanish feeling. While their rulers
were basely truckling to the invader the people rose; the flame of
insurrection spread far and wide; great riots in Toledo and Madrid
were followed by similar exhibitions of national anger throughout
the country, and Napoleon's armies, though they found no regular
opposition, though intrigue and treachery had apparently removed
all obstacles, found themselves in the midst of a hostile population,
and masters only of the ground on which they stood. To meet
this new difficulty the fertile mind of the Emperor had at once a
plan ready. Madrid was to be a centre from which should radiate
in all directions expeditionary armies to suppress the insurrections,
<span class="sidenote">Operations of Napoleon's three armies from
Madrid.</span> Madrid itself resting for support on France. To hold
the communications between Madrid and France therefore became a prime
object. This work was intrusted to Bessières, while Duhesme operated in
Catalonia, and expeditions were sent out from Madrid against Valencia
under Moncey, and against Andalusia under Dupont. Bessières, though his
general Lefèbvre failed before the desperate energy of the Saragossans,
thoroughly defeated the Gallician troops under Blake and Cuesta at the
Rio Seco. Duhesme effected nothing, and was obliged to raise the siege of
Gerona. Moncey, though he reached the town of Valencia with success, was
unable to take it, and had to retreat. Dupont pushed at first as far as
Cordova, but losing heart, and badly supplied from Madrid, also attempted
to retreat, was pursued by the Spaniards, and compelled to lay down his
arms with 18,000 men, <span class="sidenote">Joseph evacuates Madrid.
Aug. 1, 1808.</span> after the battle of Baylen, before he could recross
the Sierra Morena. Unsuccessful, therefore, on all sides, and though
victorious yet hard pressed upon the North, the French were obliged to
retire, and King Joseph, evacuating Madrid, withdrew to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portuguese royal family emigrate to Brazil.
Nov. 29, 1807.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Junot's army had proceeded direct to Portugal with orders
to occupy it by the 30th of November 1807. As Junot approached the
capital, the Prince Regent, acting under the advice of Lord Strangford,
the English ambassador, determined to leave his European dominions and to
transfer the apparatus and seat of government to Brazil. On the 29th of
November as many as 15,000 persons were carried by the English fleet down
the Tagus. The last ship had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1289" id="Page_1289">[1289]</a></span>
hardly sailed when Junot arrived. He had wished to stop and
reorganize his troops in Salamanca, but pressed by the Emperor,
<span class="sidenote">Junot's army occupies Lisbon. Nov. 30.</span> he
hurried forward in spite of the difficulties of the way, and marched
upon Lisbon with only a few thousand weary and travel-worn soldiers. He
however met with no opposition there, and after the manner of Napoleon's
lieutenants, at once set about Gallicizing the country. The Portuguese
army was chiefly sent away to France. The police in the hands of the
French was well administered, and though the people of Lisbon obeyed
unwillingly, order was successfully maintained. The position of Spain and
Portugal was thus closely analogous; in both cases the people had been
deserted by their natural rulers, in both cases the consequences were
the same. The insurrections in Spain were followed by similar movements
in Portugal. The people took the government into their own hands, and
a popular Junta was established at Oporto under the influence of the
Bishop.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_EIGHT_ENTHUSIASM_IN_ENGLAND" id="EIGHTEEN_EIGHT_ENTHUSIASM_IN_ENGLAND"></a>Enthusiasm in England for the Spanish
insurrection.</div>

<p>The insurrection in Spain had been observed with enthusiastic
admiration by the people of England. It seemed at last as if that
popular insurrection against the tyranny of Napoleon, which had long
been expected, had arrived. Nevertheless, the total absence of central
authority produced its inevitable effects upon a country so ill ruled
and so ignorant of self-government as Spain. Ambitious men everywhere
laid hold of the local authority, and irresponsible juntas arose.
The provincial feeling, always unreasonably strong in the Peninsula,
found full vent. Junta disputed with junta, and the whole country was
involved in the wildest anarchy. None the less the feeling of the English
people was a true one. Napoleon had reached the point when he came
into collision with that very power which formed the basis of his own
success&mdash;the power of the people. Already his behaviour in Germany
had excited among the lower classes enthusiastic feelings of hatred to
their conquerors and of desire for national liberty; and the outbreak of
the Spanish insurrection added fresh vigour and raised
<span class="sidenote">Asturian envoys arrive in England. June 1808.</span>
fresh hopes in the lovers of liberty throughout the whole of Europe. To
the English Government the arrival of two Asturian envoys in the month
of June seemed to offer an opportunity which had long been wanted of giving
a national and unselfish character to our opposition to the great conqueror.
In the course of time it afforded also a battle-ground on which at length
the military power of the country found room to move in larger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1290" id="Page_1290">[1290]</a></span>
more combined action, than in the feeble expeditions of the earlier
part of the war. But as yet this was not foreseen. For some years the
great war in the Peninsula was starved, while money was lavished upon
useless and isolated efforts in other parts of the Continent; it was only
slowly and by degrees that the genius, the steadfastness, the success,
of Wellington taught England the necessity of large and well-continued
efforts in one direction. The Asturian envoys were received with
enthusiasm not only by the Opposition but by the Government. But the
opportunity offered was not wisely made use of. Spain was inundated
with agents of no political ability, who were deceived by the boasting
assertions of the Spaniards. Money and arms were sent over in lavish
quantities to be left unopened on the quays, appropriated by the rival
juntas for their own personal or local advantage, or to fall into
the hands of the enemy, and the Spaniards, who did little or nothing
for themselves, were taught to demand the assistance of England as a
right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An English force sent to Portugal.</div>

<p>The position of Portugal seemed to offer a more favourable ground
for action, and thither it was determined to send an English armament.
But the Government could not yet conceive of war upon a large scale,
and in entire ignorance of the real condition of Spain believed that a
mere handful of English troops, aided by the boasted enthusiasm of the
Spanish nation, would be able to withstand the enormous armies Napoleon
was ready to pour into the Peninsula. The army at first sent was little
better than an expeditionary force. A body of troops ready at Cork for
war in South America were despatched under Sir Arthur Wellesley, at that
time Secretary for Ireland; but by some ridiculous mismanagement two
senior officers, Sir Harry Burrard, and Sir Hugh Dalrymple, Governor of
Gibraltar, were put over his head, and Sir John Moore, who was despatched
with a second body of troops to reinforce him, though he had served as
commander-in-chief both in Sicily and Sweden, also found himself in a
subordinate position. The expedition touched first at Corunna, but was
persuaded by the members of the local junta to proceed to Portugal,
where they declared the numerous Spanish army was already collected, and
whither they promised speedily to send reinforcements. Upon reaching
Oporto, however, the commander found that there were no Spanish troops in
the north of Portugal, neither were there any Portuguese troops; but upon
the river Mondego there appeared to be a disorganized body of about
5000 men, representing 40,000 for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1291" id="Page_1291">[1291]</a></span>
whom the Bishop of Oporto had received accoutrements. With them
there were some 10,000 peasants without arms. Wellesley had now
a choice left. He might land north of Lisbon and act against Junot,
or proceed to Cadiz, and joining Spencer, who had a small command
<span class="sidenote">Wellesley lands at Figueras. Aug. 1, 1808.</span>
there, act against the French in Spain. He preferred the first
alternative, and determined to land at the mouth of the Mondego, near
Figueras. He sent to Cadiz for Spencer's troops, but fortunately that
general, on hearing of the victory of Baylen, had already determined to
sail for the Tagus. The two corps when joined amounted to about 12,000
men. The landing of the English at the Mondego confined the operations
to that tongue of land which lies between the sea and the Tagus in its
south-westerly course, and which is terminated by the city of Lisbon.</p>

<p>Wellesley determined to strike rapidly, and bring affairs in
Portugal to a crisis at once. Therefore, although deserted by the
Portuguese troops, he advanced directly southward towards Lisbon.
Junot's troops were somewhat scattered, and the temper of the
people prevented him from energetic action. He proceeded, however,
to concentrate his troops, and while this movement was going
forward the English army came into contact with one of his divisions
<span class="sidenote">Combat of Rorica. Aug. 17.</span> under Laborde,
occupying a strong position at the end of a valley leading from Obidos
to Rorica. Here, after a sharp contest, the French general found
himself outflanked by the hills which line the valley, and withdrew,
allowing Wellesley to proceed. Meanwhile Junot had been continuing his
concentration, and had collected 14,000 men at Torres Vedras, to bar the
road to Lisbon. Sir Harry Burrard, Wellesley's superior officer, had now
arrived at the coast, and Wellesley begged him to allow Sir John Moore's
division, on its arrival from England, to land on the Mondego river,
and cross the tongue of land to the Tagus, thus cutting off the natural
line of retreat into Spain, which would be up the valley of that river.
He then proceeded to advance against Junot. But Burrard, a commonplace
general, disregarding his advice, determined to bring Sir John Moore
up as a reinforcement, and forbad Wellesley to undertake any offensive
movement till that general's arrival.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img516.jpg" alt="" title="Battle of Vimiero" />
<div class="caption"><p>Battle of Vimiero, Aug 21, 1808</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wellesley was therefore obliged to return to his army, which was
in position at Vimiero. A little hill covered the village to the
front. On either side of it ran a chain of heights, from which on the
east a branch ran off southwards. There was a direct road between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1292" id="Page_1292">[1292]</a></span>
Vimiero and Torres Vedras, and a second road from Torres Vedras to a
place called Lourinham ran along the top of the branch ridge crossing
the main ridge. On the hill before the village and upon the ridge to the
west Wellesley took up his position, expecting to be attacked on his
right. But early on the 21st the French <span class="sidenote">Battle of
Vimiero. Aug. 21, 1808.</span> came into view on the Lourinham road, and
as they pressed forward evidently threatened the left, and not the right,
of the English position. A considerable body of troops was therefore
moved from the right to the left ridge, a movement unobserved by the
French, for the valley between the armies was thickly wooded. For the
same reason a ravine which rendered the left wing nearly unassailable
was unobserved by the French. Junot directed two main attacks, upon the
central hill and upon the left ridge. The attack upon the centre was
defeated, for it was open on the flank to the fire of an English brigade
moving to the left, which halted half-way up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1293" id="Page_1293">[1293]</a></span>
hill when the strength of the central attack was seen; the left attack
was ruined by the ravine. Meanwhile troops had been sent to turn the
English left by the Lourinham road and to advance along the left
ridge, which the French believed almost unoccupied; but, as has been
mentioned, it was now covered with troops, and Ferguson's brigade beat
the assailants back, and pursued them along the ridge till he had
wholly separated them from the rest of the French army. They must have
capitulated had not an unexpected order arrived to halt. Sir Harry
Burrard, who had been on the field all day, had just assumed the command,
and the change of leaders became at once perceptible. When the battle was
over, thirteen guns, and many prisoners, including a general, were in
the hands of the English, and the French had lost between 2000 and 3000
men.</p>

<p>The road to Torres Vedras from Lourinham, on which the beaten
French army had collected, was two miles longer than the direct
road from Vimiero. Wellesley designed to push forward with his
victorious army, part of which had not been engaged, to forestall the
French at Torres Vedras, and cut them off from Lisbon, a measure
which, had Sir John Moore been landed from Mondego, must have
completed their ruin. Again the prudence of Sir Harry Burrard
thwarted Wellesley's plan. He was compelled to allow his army to
rest in their old position. Sir Harry Burrard having thus spoilt a
great victory, was almost immediately superseded by the arrival of
Sir Hugh Dalrymple. Their combined wisdom allowed an advance
upon Lisbon, but insisted on bringing Sir John Moore to join the
<span class="sidenote">Convention of Cintra. Aug. 30.</span>
army. While this was being settled, an envoy arrived from the French
offering to treat, and finally the convention known as the Convention
of Cintra was entered into, in many points against Wellesley's advice.
It stipulated for the evacuation of Portugal, but for the transport of
the whole French army, with their guns and horses, to France. It was
likewise arranged that the Russian fleet, at that time in Lisbon, should
be regarded as in a neutral port; but as some English regiments had got
possession of the mouth of the river, and had hoisted the English flag,
this clause was overruled, and Siniavin, the Russian admiral, with his

<p>It was not to be supposed that Napoleon would calmly watch the defeat
of his troops even in an obscure corner of Europe, still less when their
defeat seemed to thwart the completeness of his system, and was connected
with events which had driven his brother from his throne. Though he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1294" id="Page_1294">[1294]</a></span>
that conquered Prussia beneath the surface was glowing with
inextinguishable hatred, and though Austria, in spite of the war against
England in which she was nominally engaged, was strengthening her army
and re-establishing her finances in a way which seemed to threaten
fresh efforts at freedom on her part, he determined to turn the full
strength of his Empire upon the devoted Peninsula. He felt that so long
as his friendship with Russia existed, so long as the Peace of Tilsitt
held firm, his position was tolerably secure. He therefore renewed his
alliance with Russia at a meeting with the Czar at Erfurth (Oct. 12),
and suddenly ordered the widely scattered divisions of the grand army to
concentrate on Paris preparatory to marching into Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations in Spain.</div>

<p>Unconscious of the coming danger and of the vast strength of its
enemy, the central Junta at Madrid went on with its ill-arranged
preparations to secure the freedom of Spain, and with its idle boasts
as to the strength of the national armies. The English Government had
not yet lost faith in Spanish assertions, nor learnt the absolute
worthlessness of Spanish generals and armies; the fables of the Junta
gained credence, and while all the other generals who had gone to
Portugal were recalled, some 25,000 men were intrusted to Sir John
Moore, with orders to advance into Spain and assist the Spanish troops,
which were now occupying the valley of the Ebro and closing the French
frontier. Even had the Spanish troops been worth anything, there was
an absurd disproportion between the forces prepared and the scene of
action for which they were intended. Nor did this weakness fail to strike
military men. The Duke of York, though by no means a first-rate general,
called the attention of Government to the wide dissipation of the Spanish
troops, and the great distance of Portugal from the scene of action, and
gave it as his opinion that to employ less than 60,000 men was merely
to waste them. The Government refused to listen to his advice, Lord
Castlereagh, the War Minister, was unmoved, and Moore was sent forward to
certain failure. With a raw commissariat, and ill supplied with money,
although it was at that very time being lavished upon the Spaniards, he
embarked upon his dangerous march through a country where the roads were so
bad that his <span class="sidenote">Sir John Moore's march to Salamanca. Oct.</span>
artillery to reach Salamanca had to proceed all up the valley of the
Tagus almost to Madrid and come back to meet him at Salamanca, where he
was to be joined by reinforcements from England under Sir David Baird.
Moore's concentration at Salamanca was wholly based on the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1295" id="Page_1295">[1295]</a></span>
that the Spanish armies were strong enough at all events to retard, if
not wholly to resist, the invasion of the French. Yet the grand army
was rapidly approaching, and before long the forces collected upon the
frontier rendered resistance hopeless. In September arrangements were
made for the incorporation of the troops coming from Germany with those
already in Spain, and eight great corps d'armée, commanded by six French
marshals and Generals Junot and St. Cyr, besides the Imperial Guard, were
collected to bear down all opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon arrives at Vittoria. Nov. 8, 1808.</div>

<p>While Moore was painfully completing his concentration at Salamanca,
Napoleon himself arrived at Vittoria, and almost immediately the Spanish
troops, which the English general was to support, were scattered to the
winds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destruction of the Spanish armies. Napoleon at
Madrid. Dec. 4, 1808.</div>

<p>From his central position the Emperor was able to concentrate his
chief force now on his right, now on his left. In a rapid succession
of victories Lefèbvre and Soult destroyed the armies upon the left
and centre of the Spanish line, and on the 11th of November Blake was
entirely ruined at Espinosa. Immediately the whole strength of the French
army was turned against the right, and on the 23rd of the same month
Lannes crushed Palafox and Castaños at Tudela. All the boasted armies of
Spain were thus swept away as it were in a moment, and Napoleon advanced
upon Madrid, forced the passage of the Somo-Sierra, and after some slight
opposition took possession of the capital on the 4th of December. The
news of the defeats of Espinosa and Tudela reached Moore at Salamanca
before his artillery had joined him. He resolved to await its arrival,
and then to retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although Napoleon at the head of nearly 400,000
men was pressing onward rapidly to Madrid, in a few days to drive
the members of the supreme Junta fugitives to Badajos, the old
system of misrepresentation was kept up. Mr. Frere, the English
plenipotentiary, had been persuaded to share in the illusions of the
Junta, and he wrote peremptory letters, urging Moore to advance, and
to rally the Spanish armies around him behind the Tagus. But news
had at length reached Moore that those Spanish armies did not exist;
the national excitement he had been taught to expect was nowhere
visible, and he presently heard that the capital itself was in the
hands of Napoleon. For 25,000 or 30,000 English soldiers to oppose
the grand army with Napoleon at its head was simply ridiculous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1296" id="Page_1296">[1296]</a></span>
their retreat was a matter of necessity. But Moore determined before
<span class="sidenote">Sir John Moore's retreat.</span> retreating to
relieve if possible the pressure upon the south of Spain, by pushing
forward against Soult and threatening the French communications with
France. In acting thus he judged that Napoleon was far more likely to
direct his efforts against the English force than to spend his time in
subduing the southern provinces, which would easily fall into his hands
afterwards. He therefore advanced towards the Carrion river, where
Soult had collected his army. The measure succeeded. Napoleon heard of
the advance on the 21st; dismissing all thought of the Spaniards, he
checked the further advance of his troops, and turned all his attention
to crushing the English. On receipt of the news that Napoleon had left
Madrid, Moore, who had been hoping to strike a blow before the arrival of
Napoleon, at once began his retreat. He was closely followed by Soult,
while Napoleon, forcing the passes of the Guadarama, which were deep in
snow, came up from the south upon his flank. The retreat was attended
with great difficulty. Moore's troops were young, the subordination was
not perfect, and the enemy pressed him close; and at length, on the 1st
of January, Napoleon and Soult formed a junction at Astorga, and their
combined army amounted to 70,000 men. In ten days Napoleon had moved in
the depth of winter 50,000 men across 200 miles of hostile country. But
Moore's rapidity had spoilt the effect of even this stupendous march; he
had already passed Astorga.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon leaves Spain.</div>

<p>There news reached the Emperor of the approaching declaration of war
from Austria, and he found it necessary to resign the command to Soult.
Some of his troops he took with him; but Soult himself, and Ney, who
supported him, still commanded upwards of 60,000 men, by whom the pursuit
was recommenced. Amid many scenes of disorder the English army pursued
its career towards Vigo, where it was expected that the fleet would be
ready to receive it. But information was brought that the harbour was
not fit for the embarkation of troops. The line of retreat was therefore
changed to Corunna. At Lugo, so close was the pursuit that Moore thought
it necessary to prepare for battle, and the troops, though they had
suffered much and become disorderly in retreat, at once showed that their
spirit was unbroken. To the number of 16,000 they formed willingly and
regularly in array of battle. But as the French did not attack, and as
the supplies would not permit of more than one great battle, the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1297" id="Page_1297">[1297]</a></span>
being now concentrated and encouraged, Moore marched off at
night, and resumed his course towards the sea. Although the
movement was executed in the midst of a heavy storm, and though
<span class="sidenote">Moore reaches Corunna. Jan. 10.</span> so much
disorganization followed that the loss between Lugo and Betangos was
more than in all the former part of the retreat, from thence to Corunna,
the army being collected, marched in good order. As they approached the
port, to their horror they discovered that the fleet had not arrived.
Contrary winds were still detaining it at Vigo, "and the last consuming
exertion made by the army was rendered fruitless." Battle was after all
necessary. Large magazines of arms and ammunition left unappropriated
and undistributed by the Spanish authorities, though their armies were
in desperate want, were found and destroyed. The horses, many of them
already broken down, were put to death. Soult's army, almost as exhausted
by pursuit as Moore's by retreat, did not assemble till the 12th, but it
was not till the 14th that the English transports arrived. The cavalry,
who had lost their horses, the sick, and fifty pieces of artillery, were
put on board, and preparations made for covering the embarkation of the
troops. The ridge on which Soult's army was drawn up overlooked and
commanded the position of the English, and some generals were desirous
even then of entering into negotiations to secure the safe withdrawal of
the army. Moore would not hear of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_NINE_BATTLE_OF_CORUNNA" id="EIGHTEEN_NINE_BATTLE_OF_CORUNNA"></a>Battle of Corunna. Jan. 16.</div>

<p>It was determined that upon the evening of the 16th the embarkation
should take place, but about the middle of the day the French army began
the attack. Even in the last hour of retreat the English showed their
strength; the assaults of the French were repulsed on all sides, and
when night closed they were everywhere falling back in confusion. Moore
had fallen in the battle, and the command devolved on Hope. Had he known
that Soult's ammunition was nearly exhausted he would have continued the
strife, and the disaster of the French would have been complete. As it
was, he held it wiser to embark the English army during the night, an
operation which was performed successfully and without confusion. The
loss of the English was estimated at 800, that of the French at between
2000 and 3000. But though, no doubt, the battle of Corunna was an English
victory, it was advantageous only in allowing the army to be withdrawn,
and left the north-west provinces of Spain and the north of Portugal open
to the French. Sir John Moore, whose character as a soldier had already
been acknowledged, decoyed by false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1298" id="Page_1298">[1298]</a></span>
hopes and misled by false information, had yet nobly succeeded in
withdrawing for a time the pressure of the French from the south of
Spain, and in the midst of overwhelming difficulties had saved the
British army and closed his career with a brilliant victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discouragement of the English ministry.</div>

<p>The Convention of Cintra and the retreat of Sir John Moore,
the greatness of which was not understood, discouraged
the English ministry with regard to its policy in the
Peninsula. The cause of the Spaniards was however so
popular that it was not deemed advisable wholly to desert them.
For three months after the convention Portugal had been left a
prey to its own anarchy, but in December Sir John Cradock was
sent out to command the English troops. The armaments which
had been sent to Cadiz having failed to effect anything there, collected
at Lisbon. The Portuguese were at length wise enough to demand an
<span class="sidenote">Beresford made commander of the Portuguese
army.</span> English general for their army, and Beresford was sent out
to take the command, and thus something like order was re-established.
But Napoleon had commanded the conquest of Portugal, the troops of Victor
threatened it in the valley of the Tagus, while Soult had entered it
from the north and mastered Oporto. Refusing to act with insufficient
troops, and waiting for reinforcements, Sir John Cradock had wisely
taken the position to defend Lisbon from the advance of Victor, and
was stationed at Lumiar and Sacavem just above Lisbon. It was
<span class="sidenote">Wellesley arrives. April 22, 1809.</span> in this
position that Wellesley found the English army when he came to take the
command on the 22nd of April. With his arrival begins what is properly
called the Peninsula War, a war which, by constantly sapping the strength
of Napoleon, by exhibiting the possibility of his defeat, and by showing
him and his rule, in opposition not to a government, but to a people, was
to do more than anything else to complete his final overthrow.</p>

<p>But the English ministry, even while continuing the war, by no
means regarded it in this light. Their hopes were not unnaturally
turned rather to political coalitions in Europe and to expeditions
which appeared more directly to attack the heart of the French empire.
Moreover, political feeling in England was strongly excited. Though
<span class="sidenote">Division of opinion in England.</span> there was
a general desire for the continuation of the war, there was no unanimity
as to the means of carrying it on, or as to the people by whom it should
be carried on. Every disaster was exaggerated for political purposes,
every obstacle thrown in the way of ministerial action. Our system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1299" id="Page_1299">[1299]</a></span>
party government is not well suited either to great European combinations
(because the open hostility exhibited to the ministry of necessity gives
an appearance of uncertainty to our engagements) or to the carrying on
of war where secresy is necessary, and where reliance upon those to
whom the war is intrusted is required. In domestic affairs its effect
is different, and at this time the Opposition was doing good service
in bringing abuses to light and rendering salutary reforms necessary.
Early in the spring they found grounds for assaulting the ministry in
the conduct of the Duke of York, the commander-in-chief, who was accused
by a certain militia colonel, Wardle by name, of being influenced by his
mistress, Mrs. Clark, in his appointments, while her favour was said to
be procured by money. <span class="sidenote">Scandal of the Duke of York.</span>
The scandal excited was great, and the immoral details of the story were
in everybody's mouth. The inquiry made it evident that Mrs. Clark's
influence had been used, but it was not so clear that the Duke had ever
himself acted otherwise than conscientiously. The majorities in his
favour, however, were so small, that he felt it necessary to resign his
office, and Sir David Dundas was appointed in his place. Before long his
accuser was himself sued by a tradesman for the price of goods with which
he had furnished a house for Mrs. Clark. This gave such an air of malice
to the charge, and displayed Colonel Wardle's desire for purity in so
strange a light, that it greatly lessened the feeling against the Duke,
who was before long restored to his office.</p>

<p>This quarrel, in addition to the case of Lord Melville, excited
attention as to the general purity of the administration. Considerable
sums of money, amounting to nearly £20,000,000, were unaccounted
for. Nor did a committee of inquiry, though it sent in its
report, throw much light on the matter. But in March the Chancellor
of the Exchequer brought in a Bill to prevent the sale and brokerage
of office. Among other matters, attention was drawn to patronage in
<span class="sidenote">Charges against Lord Castlereagh, May.</span>
India, and Lord Castlereagh confessed to having purchased a seat
in Parliament for a friend by a gift of an Indian writership. Lord
Castlereagh's frank confession induced the House to resolve that no
criminating resolution was necessary. Again in May a fresh charge was
brought involving Lord Castlereagh and Mr. Perceval also. They were
charged with procuring the election of a certain Mr. Quintin Dick, and of
afterwards influencing his vote. They were acquitted by a large majority.
None the less, Romilly remarks in his Memoirs, "the decision of this
night, coupled with some that had lately taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1300" id="Page_1300">[1300]</a></span>
place, will do more towards disposing the nation in favour of a
parliamentary reform than all the speeches that have been or will be
made in popular assemblies." This question of parliamentary reform was
now again beginning to occupy the public mind. Though still commanding
majorities, the Cabinet was not at one with itself, and before the year
was over the ministry had to be reorganized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition to Napoleon in Germany. 1809.</div>

<p>But meanwhile the war was proceeding in its course. The threatening
news from Austria which checked Napoleon in his pursuit of Moore proved
true. The cruelty and injustice of the attack upon Spain, and the
spectacle of a people in revolt, had strongly excited the feelings of
Germany. Earnest men of all ranks had enrolled themselves in the secret
society known as the Tugendbund, which was shortly to show its strength.
The same feeling of hostility to France had shown itself in irresistible
force in Austria, smarting under its repeated disgraces. There the Court
and Government put itself at the head of the movement, and the Archduke
Charles, who was regarded as a military genius, issued a proclamation
declaring that the liberty of Europe rested with the Austrian arms. There
was no regular coalition formed, but Austria felt that it could rely upon
the friendship of England (although still nominally at war with it), of
Prussia, where the popular feeling ran high, and probably even of Russia.
Armies numbering more than 200,000 men were set on foot, and on the 9th
of April Austria declared war against Bavaria, an ally of France. The
generals left in charge of Napoleon's army in Germany somewhat mistook
his orders, and the Archduke succeeded in forming a partial concentration
of his troops and occupying Ratisbon. The arrival of the Emperor on the
field soon changed the face of affairs. A series of battles was fought;
the left wing of Charles's army was separated from the right, and his
forward advance entirely frustrated by defeats at Abendsberg (April 20),
Eckmühl (April 21), and Ratisbon (April 22). Napoleon again advanced to
Vienna. But there he found the Archduke Charles still fronting him upon
the northern side of the Danube, and the great bridge which crosses the
river at Vienna broken down. Near that city the course of the Danube is
divided by an island called Lobau, about three miles in length. Napoleon
constructed bridges at the <span class="sidenote">Battle of Aspern. May
22, 1809.</span> island, and brought his army across them into the level
called the Marchefeldt on the northern side. There was fought the great
battle of Aspern. Victory declared for neither party, and Napoleon found
himself in an awkward situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1301" id="Page_1301">[1301]</a></span>
for the river had risen, and aided by the efforts of the Austrians, had
swept away the bridge, and he was thus cut off from reinforcements.
He contrived to get back to Lobau, and there awaited his opportunity.</p>

<p>His position was indeed precarious. The secret societies had
shown themselves, and a partisan insurrection had broken out under
Colonel Schill and the Duke of Brunswick in Saxony and Westphalia.
It was premature, and without much difficulty suppressed.
<span class="sidenote">Revolt of the Tyrolese.</span> The Tyrolese too,
headed by Andrew Hofer, an inn-keeper of the valley of Passeyr, had
burst into revolt; 25,000 Bavarians which marched to suppress them
had been beaten back. Again and again in the mountain passes they
encountered and defeated both the French and Bavarian troops. The revolt
was unsuppressed, when Napoleon determined to break from his difficult
position. In July, while pretending to build a massive bridge across the
river, he brought his army rapidly across it on a temporary structure.
The Archduke, who had expected to attack the French while crossing, had
now to fight another pitched <span class="sidenote">Battle of Wagram.
July 6, 1809.</span> battle, and two vast armies, numbering together
between 300,000 and 400,000 men, encountered each other upon the
tableland of Wagram. The French gained a hard-won victory. The Archduke
was pursued to Zmaim, <span class="sidenote">Peace of Vienna. Oct. 14,
1809.</span> in Moravia, and there an armistice was made which ripened
subsequently into the Peace of Vienna, signed on the 14th of October, by
which fresh territory was torn from Austria for the advantage of Bavaria,
France, and Russia; the kingdom of Spain was recognized; the insurgents
of the Tyrol deserted, and a further pledge for the maintenance of the
Continental System given. The close of the year was marked by a still
further act of wickedness on the part of Napoleon, and a stronger proof
of how completely he had deserted the principles of the Revolution. On
the 6th of December he divorced his wife Josephine, and entered into
negotiations, which were completed the following year, for his marriage
with Maria Louisa, an Austrian princess.</p>

<p>The armistice of Zmaim was entered into on the 12th of July.
On the 27th of that month, the very day on which the news of the
armistice reached England, a great expedition left for the mouth of
the Scheldt, for the English ministry had not deceived the hopes of
<span class="sidenote">The Walcheren expedition. July 1809.</span> the
Austrians, and were determined to undertake what they hoped would prove a
diversion in their favour. For this purpose all the strength of England
was to be employed. 40,000 soldiers were to be carried across in 400
transports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1302" id="Page_1302">[1302]</a></span>
under the charge of no less than 245 ships of war. Yet, great as was
the effort, the commonest precautions were neglected. Although it was
well known that the climate of the islands at the mouth of the Scheldt
was pestiferous, the medical officers were not consulted, none of the
proper medicines were sent, and the force was accompanied, in spite of
the protest of the surgeon-general, by only one hospital ship. Moreover,
the pomp and publicity with which the expedition, which was intended to
be secret, was prepared deprived it of much of its value; and lastly,
Court and ministerial favour secured the command for Lord Chatham,
Master-General of the Ordnance, a man wholly unfitted for an important
command. At length, after much delay caused by the want of harmony
between the two branches of the service, the fleet set sail. It was the
opinion of the best officers of the army that Antwerp might have been
at once secured by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de main</i>, yet it was determined to proceed
more regularly and with deliberation; and Flushing (which, as the dykes
had been cut, was <span class="sidenote">Flushing taken. Aug. 15.</span>
regarded as impregnable) was taken in two days after the arrangements for
the attack had been completed. It was not till the 21st of August that
Lord Chatham began to think of moving towards Antwerp. But, as by that
time the enemy's squadron had been withdrawn up the river to the city,
and the intermediate fortresses had been so strengthened as to render the
advance difficult, absolutely nothing further was even attempted. The
army was kept lying in the plague-stricken swamps of Walcheren. Fever
began to make fearful ravages. On the 29th Chatham wrote home that he
could do no more&mdash;that already 3000 of the troops were sick. By
September 11,000 men were stricken, and the great bulk of the army was
ordered home. Lord Chatham, taking with him as many of the sick as he
could, accompanied it. 15,000 men were left to occupy the island. Though
the fever still spread with fearful rapidity, the only remedy supplied
was a quantity of Thames water, which was constantly sent out. The roofs
of the huts had fallen in, the men were removed to the churches, and
the churches proved damp and worse than the roofless huts. At last 100
bricklayers were sent from England to repair the huts; the bricklayers
were speedily themselves in hospital. The death rate was now 200 or 300 a
week; and so terrible was the effect of the fever, that before the next
June, of the 40,000 troops sent out 35,000 had been in hospital. Nor did
this great folly produce the smallest effect on the general war. Even
had the expedition not been so delayed that the Austrian armistice was
already signed when it sailed, it could have done no good. Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1303" id="Page_1303">[1303]</a></span>
himself wrote of it, "Before six weeks, of the 15,000 troops which are
in the Isle of Walcheren not 1500 will be left, the rest will be in
hospital. The expedition has been undertaken under false expectations
and planned in ignorance."</p>

<p>While wasting their strength in this idle display, the ministry were
being taught, had they been willing to learn, where English forces
might have been wisely employed. In Portugal, Wellesley, on taking
<span class="sidenote">Wellesley victorious in Portugal.</span>
the command, had marched against Soult in the north, had brought his
army across the Douro in face of the French, who were occupying Oporto,
had recaptured that city, and driven Soult to a desperate retreat. By
extraordinary vigour and good fortune, Soult, though there were traitors
in his camp, contrived to extricate his army, but Portugal was free.
And Wellesley, victorious in the north, and deceived by the constant
false information of the Spaniards as to the weakness of his enemies,
determined to turn his arms against the other French army which was
threatening Portugal in the valley of the Tagus. He was there to act with
the Spanish army under Cuesta, an old man of crabbed temper and of great
self-conceit. Victor's army fell back before the advancing English from
Talavera behind the Alberche river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellesley marches towards Madrid.</div>

<p>By this march Madrid was threatened, and Joseph collected for its
defence the troops of Victor, Sebastiani, and his own guard, amounting
to about 50,000 men. As Wellesley had with him less than 20,000 English
troops, and as he could place no reliance upon the Spaniards of Cuesta
though they were nearly 40,000 in number, it was a bold resolve to march
against Victor. But Wellesley was ignorant of the extreme danger of his
movement. Constantly misinformed by the Spaniards, he believed Soult's
army in Castile and the plain of the Douro to consist of about 15,000
men; in reality it was more than 50,000 strong. With these it was possible,
collecting them at Salamanca, to cross the mountains separating the plains
of the Douro and the Tagus, to pass between Wellesley's troops and
Portugal, and thus placing him between two armies, each virtually
superior to his own, entirely ruin him. Ignorant as yet of the character
of the Spaniards, Wellesley could not believe that he should be kept
uninformed, nor could he believe that the Spanish troops supplied to occupy
the passes of the mountains, and restrain, or at least check, Soult's
movements, would give ground without striking a blow; nor, before entering
on his enterprise, could he have conceived that his army would have been
systematically kept without food. It is nevertheless true that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1304" id="Page_1304">[1304]</a></span>
greatest difficulty was found in procuring rations, which often consisted
merely of a few handfuls of grain, while the Spanish troops were very
fairly fed. Victor and the King had taken up a position beyond the
Alberche stream, a little river flowing from the north into the Tagus
above Talavera. Beyond that stream, Wellesley, when he found how he
was treated, positively refused to move. Beginning to appreciate the
character of the Spanish troops, he urged Cuesta not to venture on a
forward movement without him; but the obstinate old man persisting in
passing the Alberche, was roughly handled by Victor, and only saved from
the consequences of his rashness by English assistance.</p>

<p>Soult had informed Joseph of his great plan. All the King had to
do was to remain quiet, and check the advance of the English till
Wellesley was caught in the trap. But there was a second Spanish
army apparently threatening Madrid from the south. It might well
be that before Soult's arrival the capital would be lost, although, if
Soult's plan answered, it would be immediately regained. The King
could not bring himself to bear even the temporary loss of his capital,
especially as the hospitals and supplies for his army were there. He
therefore rashly listened to the advice of Victor, which was contrary
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Talavera. July 28, 1809.</span> to
that of Jourdan, his proper military adviser, and determined to attack
the English. The position of Talavera is about two miles in length,
crossing the plain from the river Tagus to a small range of hills which
bounds the valley; beyond this range is a second valley of about half
a mile in extent, and then come the mountains. The key of the position
is the highest of the secondary hills, and this Wellesley occupied. The
Spaniards he placed behind entrenchments in Talavera. Victor made a
second error in making two preliminary attacks upon the key hill. Though
these attacks failed, he still believed he could carry the position, and
Joseph yielded to his desire for a general engagement. This was fought on
the 28th of July. The advance of the French light dragoons so frightened
the Spaniards that many regiments at once turned and fled, carrying
the news down the valley that the English army was destroyed. Such as
remained in their strong position proved sufficient to hold it, and were
not seriously molested. The whole brunt of the battle fell upon the
English in the centre and left wing. At one moment the centre was broken
through, and disaster might have followed had not Wellesley at once seen
what was wanted, and sent the 48th regiment down from the hill, though
the fighting there was severe, and re-established the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1305" id="Page_1305">[1305]</a></span>
in the centre. An extraordinary and reckless charge of the 23rd
light dragoons across an apparently impassable ravine, though carried out
with the loss of almost half their number, had the effect of paralyzing
a whole division of the French army, which was attempting to turn the
English left by the valley between the hills and the mountains. When
the evening closed the French had been defeated at all points, and the
English remained masters of their position.</p>

<p>But by that time Soult had come almost unopposed through the mountains
from Salamanca to Placentia and the direct road to Portugal was closed.
All hopes of rendering the victory useful were therefore gone, and
Wellesley was compelled to cross to the south of the Tagus, and take
refuge among the mountains. After considerable loss and much suffering
from the abominable usage he endured from the hands of the Spaniards, he
came to a fixed determination that he would never again act in concert
with them, that henceforward his first duty lay in saving Portugal,
from which, if events favoured him, he might ultimately advance with an
English and Portuguese army, and do for the Spaniards what they were
totally unable to do for themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the victory in England.</div>

<p>The victory of Talavera was a great one, and the English ministry
recognized it as such by raising Wellesley to the Peerage as Viscount
Wellington. Nevertheless it was open to the cavils of the Opposition, for
it could be truly urged that it had not produced any permanent advantage,
and had been followed by a somewhat disastrous retreat. In Parliament
some Opposition speakers even went so far as to urge that the name of the
commander should be omitted from the vote of thanks to be given to the
army. But it was in fact the weak war administration in England which
rendered it useless. Our resources had been wasted in the pompous and
ridiculous Walcheren expedition, and in a second expedition, almost as
useless, which was despatched to Italy, where it was unable to effect
anything, and had to withdraw to Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French victories. Nov. 1809.</div>

<p>When Wellington withdrew from Talavera, after waiting some time on
the Guadiana, he took up his position in the more northern part of
Portugal, near Almeida, preparing for the defence of the country. During
his inactivity there the advance of the French was nearly unchecked.
They marched into Aragon and Catalonia, and defeated an army of 50,000
Spaniards at Ocana (Nov. 20), thus throwing open the province of La
Mancha, and obtaining an opportunity for further advance into Andalusia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1306" id="Page_1306">[1306]</a></span>
This province was also overrun, with the exception of Cadiz, which was
saved by General Albuquerque. The invasion thus formed itself
into three defined divisions; an army for the invasion of Portugal, an
army for the completion of the conquest of Andalusia, and an army
in Catalonia, while the King and his Imperial Guards formed an
army in the centre. Having thus borne down all opposition in
Spain, Napoleon's intention was to overrun Portugal in the following
year. His army for the purpose was placed under the command of
Massena, while Soult was intrusted with the operations next in
importance, and directed against Cadiz.</p>

<p>The assault which Wellington had been long preparing to resist
was now to come. The ministers in England&mdash;in part despairing of
his success, in part unable to comprehend the greatness of his
schemes&mdash;distinctly told him that he must rely upon himself. But,
with extraordinary steadfastness and courage, he undertook the task.
Ever since the October of the preceding year he had foreseen what
would happen; he had known that in all probability his troops
would be outnumbered, and that he should be unable to make head
against the vast armies which Napoleon might set at motion against
him. He had therefore designed a great defensive scheme, so that if
the worst came to the worst he might still have some place to which
to retire and avoid the necessity of evacuating Lisbon. He had
therefore turned the promontory between the Tagus and the sea
into a vast fortification. During the time of his delay on the

1810.</span> Guadiana, and while wintering near Almeida, thousands of
Portuguese workmen were turning the hills into impregnable fortresses.
This great work, known as the lines of Torres Vedras, was threefold.
The outer line, twenty-nine miles in length, extended from Alhandra on
the Tagus to the mouth of the little river Zizandra close to Torres
Vedras. The second, twenty-four miles in length, and which was intended
originally to be the strongest of the two, was from six to ten miles in
rear of the first, reaching from the Tagus at Quintella to the mouth of
the St. Lorenza. In addition to this, a small fortification was erected
to cover an embarkation in case the other two lines were forced. It
enclosed an entrenched camp and Fort St. Julian, and was two marches in
rear of the first line. Time had allowed Wellington so to strengthen
the first line that it subsequently proved sufficient for all purposes.
The General's great cares during the winter had been,&mdash;first, to
instruct the Portuguese authorities to insist upon the inhabitants
destroying all villages, mills, and crops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1307" id="Page_1307">[1307]</a></span>
in the course of the invading force when it should appear; secondly, to
get the half-trained militia of the country over which he held command
employed in such a manner as to oblige the French to act in a mass and
prevent detailed fighting; and thirdly, so to arrange his troops that
while spread abroad, for greater ease in procuring provisions, they
should yet be within easy distance for concentration. He thus waited,
fully prepared to carry out his great scheme when Massena should think
fit to strike the first blow. So determined was he to adopt a waiting
policy, that he even allowed the great fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo, the
key of that part of Spain, to be taken before his eyes. Meanwhile he had
to listen calmly to the assertions of the Opposition in Parliament, that
no British soldier would leave the Peninsula but as a prisoner, and to
see the City of London addressing the throne to inquire into his conduct,
and protesting against conferring honours and distinctions on a general
who had exhibited nothing but useless valour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massena advances against him. Sept. 1810.</div>

<p>Ciudad Rodrigo fell on the 11th of July. It was not till September
that the great attack began. Then Massena, with an army of
65,000 men, set forward towards Lisbon by the valley of
the Mondego, having been informed by friendly Portuguese
that the road was easy, and that there was no
important position between him and Coimbra, where he believed he
could forestall Wellington. An accident lost the English commander
the advantage that any opposition from the fortress of
Almeida might have given him. The explosion of a magazine
rendered the capitulation of the fortress necessary almost immediately.
In spite of Massena's attempts to deceive him as to the road
he intended to pursue, in spite of the distance at which some of the
English troops were stationed, Wellington contrived to collect his
army and to place it between Massena and Coimbra. Down the
valley of the Mondego the march was continued. The orders for
the destruction of the property were carried out as far as possible,
and crowds of wretched fugitive peasants accompanied the army. A
panic began to spread in Portugal. The intriguing regency did not
carry out the orders for destruction with sufficient activity. There
was yet enough food left between Mondego and the lines to supply
the French during the ensuing winter. To raise the temper of the
country, and to excite the people to the voluntary destruction of
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Busaco. Sept. 29, 1810.</span>
their property, Wellington was compelled (in entire opposition
to his original plans) to fight a great battle with
the advancing French. He selected the ridge of Busaco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1308" id="Page_1308">[1308]</a></span>
which almost closes the valley of the Mondego, just north of Coimbra, as
his battlefield. The English and Portuguese there stood at bay, and the
French were completely defeated. The moral effect was all that could be
desired&mdash;the Portuguese troops thenceforward became fitting comrades
for the English, and the waning trust of the people was restored; but as
a military operation it effected nothing. Massena found a pass through
the hills upon his right, through which he withdrew with his beaten
forces, and Wellington, not attempting to attack him, fell back, giving
orders to the Portuguese militia to close upon the French rear. Thus
harassed in his progress, Massena arrived before the famous lines (of the
existence of which he had only heard five days before), only to find them
thoroughly occupied by the English troops. Against the works he could do
nothing; his operations were in fact reduced to a blockade. Massena's
object, therefore, was to feed his army till reinforcements arrived,
Wellington's, by closing up the Portuguese militia behind
<span class="sidenote">Massena retreats. Nov.</span> the French army,
rapidly to reduce it to starvation. The expected reinforcements did not
come, and on the 14th of November Massena, who had lost upwards of 30,000
men since he had entered Portugal, was obliged to draw off his army and
begin a regular retreat. He moved leisurely, hoping to strike another
blow before he finally withdrew, but when reinforcements arrived for the
English he proceeded with some haste to Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo. The
operations were closed by the combat of Sabugal (April 3, 1811), where
Massena was again worsted, and after which he finally withdrew from
Portugal.</p>

<p>While Massena was attacking Portugal, Soult had been vigorously
prosecuting the siege of Cadiz, and had there made dispositions which
would probably have ended in its capture, when he was ordered to assist
Massena, for the Emperor was more anxious to put an end to the regular
warfare in Portugal than to complete his conquests in Spain. Portugal is
assailable either by the northern line from Salamanca, which Massena had
already followed, a line covered by the fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo, or
by a line south of the Tagus through Estremadura and Alemtejo, which is
covered by Badajos and Elvas. In this latter direction Soult had marched;
the fruit of his operations were the victory of Gebora (Feb. 19), where
the Spaniards were completely defeated, and the capture of Badajos. The
two great frontier fortresses between Spain and Portugal were thus in the
hands of France. But the departure of Soult from Cadiz encouraged Graham,
who commanded the English in that fortress, to attempt to drive Victor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1309" id="Page_1309">[1309]</a></span>
was left in command, from his lines. A combined force of about 12,000
men sailed from Cadiz southward, intending to march upon the back of the
French lines. Victor, marching out to defend them, was defeated at Barosa
(March 5) by the vigour and generalship of Graham, La Peña, the Spanish
commander, as usual, adding nothing to the victory, and failing when the
victory was won to put it to any use. The battle was however so severe
a threat that Soult, not wishing to lose all the fruit of his former
arrangements, withdrew from his attack on Portugal. Yet, as both Badajos
and Ciudad Rodrigo were in the hands of the French, in the following
campaign there were two scenes of operation of which those fortresses
were the centres.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/img534.jpg" alt="" title="Battle of Albuera" />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington's great plans.</div>

<p>The ministry in England had at last begun to feel some confidence
in their general, but they would have been content with the successful
defence of Portugal. Not so Wellington; his mind was full of great
projects for the relief of Spain. The two points on which the French
pressure was strongest were Catalonia and Cadiz; and Wellington,
believing that Massena, although his troops had been again raised to
50,000 men, would not be in a fit state for immediate action, had it now
in his mind either to invest Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo, betake himself
with much of his army to Badajos, unite with the English and Portuguese
troops there, and assault Soult in Andalusia; or to engage in a still
more magnificent plan,&mdash;to march his army right across Spain,
taking Madrid on the way, which would cut off the resources of Soult's
army and oblige it to withdraw, and then upon the eastern coast to enter
into communications with the English troops at that time in Sicily, and,
working from a new base of operations, to attack the French in Catalonia.
In either case the capture of Badajos was necessary, as its possession
by the French was a constant threat to the Spaniards in Cadiz and to
the southern provinces of Portugal. Wellington therefore, leaving the
blockade of Almeida in the hands of Spencer, went to Elvas to arrange
with Marshal Beresford, who commanded the troops in that direction, for
the siege of Badajos. Before his arrangements were completed he was
hastily summoned again to the north, where Massena had unexpectedly shown
signs of activity, and was moving to relieve Almeida. Wellington was in
time to check him at the hard-fought battle of Fuentes Onoro (May 5),
which was followed by the evacuation of the fortress. He then returned to
superintend the more important <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_BATTLE_OF_ALBUERA" id="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_BATTLE_OF_ALBUERA"></a>Battle of Albuera.
May 16, 1811.</span> operation of the siege of Badajos. But before he
arrived the operations had been interrupted. Soult had advanced to
succour his late prize, and Beresford had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1310" id="Page_1310">[1310]</a></span>
thought it necessary to fight a battle with him at Albuera. This
battle, one of the bloodiest ever fought, took place on the 16th of
May. The English and their allies had about 30,000 infantry and
2000 cavalry, but of these only 7000 were English, and the Spaniards
were not to be trusted. Soult had with him only 19,000 good
infantry and 4000 cavalry, but Beresford's faulty arrangements
almost neutralized the superiority in forces. The English position
was a ridge, in front of which ran the Albuera river. In the centre
were the village and bridge of Albuera, through which ran the road
to Valverde over the ridge. This road being Beresford's only
line of retreat, he regarded a hill in the centre which defended it
as the key of his position, and there put his best troops, intrusting
the right to the Spaniards under Blake. He also neglected to place
any troops across the river, and the enemy's movements were entirely
hidden by the wooded heights on that side. For a direct attack
Beresford's dispositions were correct, but upon his right a tableland
stretched so far back as to command the Valverde road and to look
along the back of the English position. Soult saw that by mastering
this height he would cut off the English from retreat, oblige them to
form a wholly new front, and in all probability destroy them. He
therefore secretly, under cover of the hills, massed his troops upon his
own left, and while a sufficiently important assault was made upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1311" id="Page_1311">[1311]</a></span>
the bridge to attract Beresford's attention, the bulk of the French
army rapidly proceeded to place itself at right angles to the English
position upon the tableland. The main point of the battle was in the
struggle for the possession of this vantage-ground. In vain Beresford
entreated Blake to change his front and cover the right. The Spanish
general insisted that the real attack was upon the village. Beresford
himself took the command of the Spanish troops, the change of front
was effected, but even then they could scarcely be induced to move.
At length the English second division moved from the centre and
mounted the hill. But, brought too recklessly into action, they suffered
much. Scarcely a third of the regiments remained standing,
and Beresford was already thinking of retreat when Colonel Hardinge
induced Cole with the fourth division, and Abercrombie with the
third brigade of the second division, neither of whom had been much
engaged, to advance to the rescue. At the head of 6000 men Hardinge
advanced to cover the hill. The crowded formation of the French,
who were in column, impeded their movements, and the advance of
the English was so irresistible, that at length, unable to open out,
they gave ground, and in the words of Napier, "slowly and with a
horrid carnage were pushed by the incessant vigour of the attack to
the furthest edge of the hill," and at length "the mighty mass, breaking
off like a loosened cliff, went headlong down the steep; the rain
flowed in streams discoloured with blood, and 1800 unwounded men,
the remnant of 6000 unconquerable British soldiers, stood triumphant
on the fatal hill." In four hours nearly 7000 of the allies and 8000
French were struck down. The victory was however won, and after
occupying a threatening position during the 17th, on the 18th Soult
marched away. The advantages of this bloody battle were little or
none.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Critical position of the French.</div>

<p>Yet though the battles of Fuentes Onoro and Albuera produced little
result, although the French continued their successes in Catalonia, and
Spain seemed entirely at their disposal, their position was by no means
wholly prosperous. The broken armies of the Spanish had formed themselves
into guerilla bands, their useless generals were superseded by daring
partisan commanders, and troops wholly untrustworthy in pitched battles
proved masters of the art of wild irregular warfare. It was only in large
masses that the French were safe; yet, as Napoleon always acted on the
principle that war should support war, and allowed only £80,000 for the
maintenance of his armies in Spain, which at that time amounted to more
than 300,000 men, the dispersion of the forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1312" id="Page_1312">[1312]</a></span>
was an absolute necessity in order that food might be procured. No
courier could be despatched except under escort; letters to Paris were
guarded at first by 1400 dragoons, subsequently by 3000. Moreover,
Joseph, and the Emperor were not at one. The Spanish King did not wish
to rule only as the agent of his brother in a conquered country, and at
length the vexatious tyranny of Napoleon pressed so heavily upon him,
that he went to Paris and resigned his crown. He was induced to take it
back again, but the mere fact of his visit, coupled with Wellington's
success and the late victories, which were complete if not decisive,
raised the spirits of the patriots and increased the energy and number of
the guerillas. Moreover, affairs in Europe were beginning to take a turn
which compelled Napoleon to act with less vigour in the Peninsula. His
marriage with the Austrian archduchess was a deadly insult to the Czar,
for a princess of whose house he had previously been negotiating; the
Continental System was becoming almost unbearable, coupled as it was with
the French occupation of the northern ports of Germany; and the addition
of territory to the Duchy of Warsaw seemed to threaten a restoration of
the Polish kingdom, and to be a violation of the Treaty of Tilsitt. The
estrangement of the Czar was becoming so evident that Napoleon's mind
began to turn more and more towards an expedition against Russia. The
number of troops in Spain was lessened, and first-rate soldiers withdrawn
to give place to new conscripts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Wellington.</div>

<p>But, in spite of this relaxation, this year forms in the opinion of
the great historian of the war its most critical period. For Wellington
was miserably supplied from home, and sickness was rife among his troops,
so that he could not bring more than 8000 men into the field, while the
Portuguese Government, quarrelling with him, frequently refused supplies,
and so starved their own troops, that instead of 40,000 soldiers who had
been available on Massena's advance, only 19,000 badly-fed men were now
with the army, and against this weakened force a new combination of the
French had been arranged. The battle of Albuera had been followed by a
renewal of the siege of Badajos. Want of proper material rendered the
progress of the siege slow, and Marmont, who had succeeded Massena in
command of the army of Portugal, was ordered to co-operate with Soult
coming from the south to relieve it. Their junction was effected and the
siege was raised. To all appearance therefore the battle of Albuera had
been a French victory, and two armies instead of one appeared to threaten
Portugal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1313" id="Page_1313">[1313]</a></span>
by the southern line. Wellington had brought his troops down and
<span class="sidenote">The French refuse the battle at Caya. June,
1811.</span> offered the combined generals battle upon the Caya. But,
ignorant of the weakness of the English, and imposed upon by the
confident front which Wellington with astonishing boldness showed them,
the battle, which might easily have been decisive of the fate of the
Peninsula, was refused by the French generals, and Soult moved southward,
while Marmont returned to occupy the valley of the Tagus.</p>

<p>This critical year of 1811 was a bitter disappointment to Wellington.
He had hoped that his period of inactivity was over, that the defensive
might have been changed to an offensive warfare. The blunders of his
subordinates, the wretched jealousies of the Portuguese regency, and the
poor support he received from home, had rendered his efforts futile. He
still found himself when the year closed obliged to be contented with
preserving his defensive attitude in Portugal. It was even worse than
this. The French had succeeded in completing the conquest of the east of
Spain, and the army of Suchet had advanced as far as Valencia; while in
the north Asturias and Galicia had again fallen into their hands. Some
gleam of success had indeed been visible in the south, where Hill had
checked Drouet in Estremadura, and where Soult had been beaten off in
his attack upon the little fortress of Tarifa. But the reorganization of
the French army (especially of the great army of the centre), and the
threatened reappearance of Napoleon upon the scene, rendered the close of
the year one of gloom and despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Threatened war between France and Russia.</div>

<p>Yet events were occurring in Europe which allowed Wellington still
to hope. Already, as early as the beginning of 1810, the appropriation
by Napoleon of the estates of the Duke of Oldenburg, a relative of
Alexander, had induced the Czar to declare his freedom from the
Continental System. It had become evident to him that, sooner or later,
war would be forced upon him, and he had entered into open preparations.
Under one pretext or another Napoleon had also been strengthening his
troops upon the eastern frontier of his dominions, and though the forms
of friendship were still kept up, it was plain that before long the two
empires would be plunged into hostilities. During the whole of 1811
remonstrances and recriminations had passed between the courts. Alexander
had at first intended to re-establish the kingdom of Poland, where the
influence of Napoleon was still great, and to begin offensive movements.
The success of Wellington at Torres Vedras is said to have suggested to
him and to his counsellors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1314" id="Page_1314">[1314]</a></span>
the more prudent method of attracting the French into the heart of
Russia, and of allowing the weather and the natural difficulties of the
country to have their full force as his allies. He knew that, in spite
of the marriage of the Austrian archduchess with Napoleon, he could rely
upon the friendship of the Court of Vienna should any opportunity arise
of successful opposition to France. Prussia likewise, since the battle
of Jena, had undergone a complete though silent revolution; feudalism
had been almost destroyed, the peasants given a share in the property of
the land, and bourgeois and peasant alike endowed with self-government;
the people and the government were absolutely at one. While ostensibly
restricted to the treaty number of 42,000, the army had been practically
increased to 150,000 men; and, by an extraordinary effort of patience
and good administration, the broken nation had been re-established.
There, too, it was certain that any successful effort to check Napoleon
would be hailed with delight. But Napoleon, observing that Russia did
not take the initiative, and seeing that both Austria and Prussia were
to all appearance still at his service, forgetting the lesson which he
should have learnt from Spain, that the enmity of the people is more to
be feared than the enmity of the government, seemed irresistibly led
to the war which was to complete his ruin. In August 1811 there took
place another of those scenes which had so frequently preluded war. At
a public meeting of ministers in the Tuileries the Russian ambassador
had to undergo a violent attack from the Emperor. From that moment all
Europe knew that the war with Russia was determined on. It was upon the
certainty of the approach of this event and the nature of the French
warfare in Spain that Wellington rested his hopes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington's plan for the campaign of 1812.</div>



<p>Marmont's army had been moved for the sake of procuring food into the
valley of the Tagus, which was thus called upon to support two armies,
that of the centre and that of Portugal. Wellington did not believe
that it could do this for long, but while the armies were there barring
the valley of the Tagus offensive movements of any importance were
impossible, as Soult and Drouet occupied the south, and the northern army
in Asturias, capable of being reinforced by Marmont, prevented action
in the valley of the Douro. But meanwhile Ciudad Rodrigo was not itself
within immediate reach of the covering army; a sudden attack and capture
of this fortress would almost certainly bring Marmont northward to save
the neighbouring country and to relieve the valley of the Tagus. Even a
weak army covered by the fortress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1315" id="Page_1315">[1315]</a></span>
would probably be able to make good its position, while Wellington
himself marching southward might also capture Badajos, and thence
defeat Soult and Drouet in Andalusia. With infinite pains to avoid
discovery he ripened his plan; preparations were secretly made at
Almeida and at Elvas for the two sieges, and the first rapid blow
was successfully struck, and Ciudad Rodrigo captured (Jan. 19).
It had the effect expected; Marmont collected his troops at Salamanca,
the scattered detachments of the French were everywhere
drawn in, Hill's southern army was moved towards the north, and
Wellington was sufficiently strong to fight a battle if necessary.
Marmont for the present resigned the fortress and again distributed
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWELVE_CAPTURE_OF_RODRIGO" id="EIGHTEEN_TWELVE_CAPTURE_OF_RODRIGO"></a>Capture of Rodrigo and Badajos.</span> his
troops. Wellington then proceeded to strike his second blow. Leaving one
division behind him, with some Spanish troops and Portuguese militia,
he moved southward, and at length succeeded in storming Badajos also,
though with fearful loss (April 6). He acted with unusual skill, and
the charge against him of having foolishly wasted life in the siege
proves upon examination to be utterly groundless; for it was the extreme
rapidity with which the fortress was captured which prevented Soult from
coming to its relief. But again the fruits of his success were snatched
from him; he was unable to follow out his plan of driving Soult from
Estremadura, for he was badly seconded by the troops he had left in the
north; Marmont, though somewhat slowly, had begun to carry out Napoleon's
orders to regain Ciudad Rodrigo and to invade Portugal, and Wellington
had to make all haste back to re-establish his affairs there. His rapid
appearance from the south on Marmont's flank compelled that general to
retreat, but the opportunity of a southern war was over, and the English
army was again spread along the whole line of Portugal, but with this
important advantage that the two key fortresses of Spain were now in its
hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington's attack on the northern army.</div>

<p>It was as yet only the spring, Wellington had to choose in which
direction he would arrange the ensuing campaign. He determined to make
his attack on the northern line; a victory over Marmont would throw open
the road to Madrid, and Soult would either have to retire from the south
or be cut off from his communications. A portion of his army might indeed
be sent to assist Marmont; but the harvest in the valley of the Douro is
considerably later than in the south, and it was impossible that a large
additional number of troops should be subsisted for at least a fortnight
to come. Thus for a while he could act against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1316" id="Page_1316">[1316]</a></span>
Marmont alone. Further to secure his position, he strengthened the
army under Hill in the south, planned and executed an extraordinary
capture of the French lines of communication at Almaraz, thus
rendering the intercourse between the two armies lengthy, and at
the same time re-established the bridge of Alcantara, close to the
Portuguese frontier, by which his own communications with Hill
were rendered ten days nearer. It was thus against an army of
about equal numbers with his own, but isolated for the present at
all events from reinforcements, that Wellington advanced. Salamanca
and its forts were captured, and Marmont fell back before him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img540.jpg" alt="" title="Battle of Salamanca" />
</div>

<p>But his advance was not all triumphant, Marmont succeeded
in turn in obtaining the ascendant. By a series of clever movements
he compelled Wellington to retire, and moving towards the
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Salamanca. July 22, 1812.</span> right
flank of the English, seemed to threaten the communications between
Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, while he kept himself in communication
with the central army under the king. Wellington saw that retreat was
necessary, and he intended to return to Portugal. But Marmont was not
contented with this success. He was eager to fight before his junction
with the king, and brought on a battle beyond the Tormes, just south of
Salamanca. The English occupied a sort of basin in a loop of the river;
about the centre was a hill called the Arapiles; round the southern edge
was a ridge which led to the point where the road by which the English
must retreat ran. Marmont, hoping to envelop the English, sent forward
his left along the ridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1317" id="Page_1317">[1317]</a></span>
Wellington saw the advantage thus offered. Holding the Arapiles with his
left, he fell on the flank of the advancing column, while Pakenham faced
it upon the ridge. The French left was thus entirely destroyed, their
attacks upon the central hill were unsuccessful, their confusion was
increased by the loss of their commander, who was wounded early in the
day, and it was only because a Spanish garrison which should have cut
off their retreat across the Tormes at Alba had been withdrawn without
Wellington's knowledge that their army escaped destruction. As it was,
Clausel, who had succeeded Marmont, was able to bring off the greater
part of his troops in safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington enters Madrid. Aug. 12, 1812.</div>

<p>The arrival of reinforcements under Sir Home Popham on the north
of Spain had drawn a certain portion of the French troops in that
direction, and against a weakened and defeated army Wellington proceeded
in his triumphant advance toward Madrid. Joseph again left the city
and retreated to Valencia, and with all the signs of wild rejoicing
the conqueror was received in the capital of Spain. The effect of the
late battle was exactly such as had been anticipated&mdash;King Joseph,
acting as commander-in-chief, ordered Soult to evacuate Andalusia and
the south. It was in vain that that general pointed out the possibility
of holding his position there, and intreated the king to come with the
other armies to his rescue: the orders were peremptory, and much against
his will Soult withdrew and effected a junction with Joseph and Suchet
in Valencia. The south and centre of Spain thus seemed clear of enemies,
but the hold of the French was as yet shaken only, not broken; for in
fact though Wellington's march had forced his enemies in two directions
(Clausel, with the remainder of Marmont's army, having retired north,
while the king withdrew south-east), such were their numbers that each
division became the centre of an army as powerful as his own. Indeed,
the very effect of his victory in drawing Soult from Andalusia had
concentrated a vast power in Joseph's hands. Wellington was, however,
aided by two circumstances. An expedition had been sent to Sicily under
Sir William Bentinck; a portion of it under Maitland was landed at
Alicante, and kept Suchet and the Catalonian army in play, while Sir Home
Popham did the like for the army of the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His great plans thwarted.</div>

<p>Of the two armies against which Wellington had to contend by
far the largest was the army of Soult and the king, on
the south-east. On the other hand, Clausel's forces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1318" id="Page_1318">[1318]</a></span>
beaten and retreating, so that it appeared to the general better to leave
a detachment under Hill to cover Madrid, while he himself repaired
with the bulk of his army to strike a final blow at Clausel by the
capture of Burgos, intending to return at once and with his whole combined
forces fight a great battle with Soult and the king before the
capital. Again events occurred, upon which he could scarcely have
calculated, which thwarted his purpose. The Spanish army, which had
been intrusted with the duty of guarding his communications with
Salamanca and of completing the capture of the fortresses of the Douro,
and some English forces which had been left to assist it, were so badly
handled that the retreating army was in fact left unmolested, while
extreme want of money and political difficulties hampered Wellington's
own march. Clausel, too, proved a general of great ability; his retreat
up the valley of the Arlanzon towards Burgos was a masterpiece;
while, to crown all, the resistance offered by Burgos and the deficiency
of proper artillery proved greater obstacles than had been
expected. The delay thus caused allowed the French to recover;
the crisis was met with energy, fresh troops were poured across the
frontier; Souham, who took the chief command, found himself at
the head of a force almost double that of Wellington; and as Soult
began to draw towards Madrid from Valencia, thus threatening the
safety of Hill, there was no course left but to summon that
<span class="sidenote">He retreats to Portugal.</span> general northward,
and to make a combined retreat towards Salamanca and Portugal. It was
not the most glorious passage of our arms. Want of pay and some other
causes had somewhat slackened the discipline of the troops, and though
no disaster occurred, and though the French were more than once checked,
there were scenes of wild disorder and insubordination which called forth
stern reprimands from the general.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvement in his position.</div>

<p>This was the last of Wellington's retreats. Events in Europe lessened
the power of his enemies; while fighting for his very existence on the
main continent of Europe, Napoleon could not but regard the war in Spain
as a very secondary concern, and a great many old and valuable soldiers
were withdrawn. The jealousy which existed between Joseph and the
generals, and the dislike of the great generals to take upon themselves
the Spanish war, threw it into inferior hands for some little while,
and there is little more to chronicle than a succession of hard-won
victories. Moreover, Wellington's position was in other ways much
strengthened; he had received from the Brazils full power of action in
Portugal, at Burgos he had been made commander-in-chief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1319" id="Page_1319">[1319]</a></span>
Spanish army, while the changes in the ministry at home, though
they had deprived him of his brother's assistance, had yet been on
the whole favourable to him; his greatness and success had become
the chief support of the ministry. He had, moreover, by his personal
authority established discipline in the Portuguese army, had used his
power and influence to supply the commissariat and other trains, and
even the Spanish troops which had been placed at his disposal had
been brought into something like order. The whole active force of
the French had been reduced to 197,000 men, while Wellington had
contrived to prepare 200,000 allied troops for the campaign, although
it was chiefly upon the 70,000 Anglo-Portuguese that he relied.
The English fleets covered the coast, and every port thus became
a little centre of action. A vigorous insurrection had arisen all
along the northern provinces; and it was this more than anything
else which decided Wellington's course of action. While leaving
troops to occupy the attention of the French in the valley of the
Tagus, he intended to march by his own left (thus avoiding the difficulties
offered by the Douro and the Carrion rivers), connect himself
with the northern insurgents, and directly threaten the communications
with France, either fighting for or turning every position in
which the king might try to intercept him.</p>

<p>His movements, which had to be effected with considerable secresy,
were well carried out; the various divisions of his army met at Toro
on the Douro. As he had expected, the French had to fall back
before him; he compelled them to evacuate Burgos and attempt to
defend the Ebro. Their position there was turned, and they had
again to fall back into the basin of Vittoria. This is the plain of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTEEN_BATTLE_OF_VITTORIA" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTEEN_BATTLE_OF_VITTORIA"></a>Battle of Vittoria. June 21, 1813.</span> river
Zadora, which forms in its course almost a right angle at the south-west
corner of the plain, which it thus surrounds on two sides. Across the
plain and through Vittoria runs the high road to France, the only one
in the neighbourhood sufficiently large to allow of the retreat of
the French army, encumbered with all its stores and baggage, and the
accumulated wealth of some years of occupation of Spain. While Wellington
forced the passage of the river in front south of the great bend, and
drove the enemy back to the town of Vittoria, Graham beyond the town
closed this road. The beaten enemy had to retreat as best he could
towards Salvatierra, leaving behind all the artillery, stores, baggage,
and equipments.</p>

<p>The offensive armies of France had now to assume the defensive
and to guard their own frontier. Before advancing to attack them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1320" id="Page_1320">[1320]</a></span>
in the mountains, Wellington undertook the blockade of Pampeluna
and the siege of St. Sebastian. It was impossible for the French
any longer to regard diplomatic or dynastic niceties. Joseph was
superseded, and the defence of France intrusted to Soult, with whom
<span class="sidenote">Battles of the Pyrenees. 1813.</span> the king
had hopelessly quarrelled. He proved himself worthy of the charge. A
series of terrible battles was fought in the Pyrenees, but one by one his
positions were forced. With fearful bloodshed, St. Sebastian was taken,
the Bidasoa was crossed (Oct. 7), the battle of the Nivelle fought and
won (Nov. 10), and at length, in January, Soult was driven even from the
Adour and forced to surrender Bayonne.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img544.jpg" alt="" title="Battle of Vittoria" />
</div>

<p>But by this time events on the other side of France had changed
the appearance of the war. Napoleon's threatened invasion of
Russia had taken place; the defensive plan adopted by the Russians
proved successful. The Emperor had himself hastened back to Paris
after the conflagration of Moscow, while his ruined and broken army
struggled home through the terrible suffering of the Russian winter.
As Alexander had foreseen, the reverse of the French had been followed
by the defection at first of Prussia and shortly afterwards
of Austria. The powers of Europe were thus again formed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1321" id="Page_1321">[1321]</a></span>
coalition. With such troops as he could collect, Napoleon had hurried, in
the summer of 1813, to the very furthest confines of Germany, and fought
the great battles of Lutzen and Bautzen. But the flower of his troops had
been lost in Russia, his armies were no longer what they had been. His
enemies in vast numbers began to gather round him. Though victorious at
the gigantic battle of Dresden (Aug. 24, 1813), he was unable to make a
final stand against the vast armaments of the coalition. Several of his
lieutenants were defeated, and at length, on the 19th of October, the
battle of Leipsic was fought, which ended in his complete defeat. It is
said that on the two sides the killed and wounded amounted to 110,000
men. The victorious allies swept onwards, and just at the close of the
year 1813 entered France. The spring of the following year was occupied
by the brilliant campaign in which Napoleon exerted all his genius in
vain to check the huge masses of the invaders. While Wellington was
making good his position in the south of France, in spite of the ability
which he displayed, Napoleon was being constantly driven backward upon
the east. The effect could not but be felt by the southern army, and
Soult deserves great credit for the skill with which he still held at bay
the victorious English. He was however defeated at Orthes (Feb. 27), lost
Bordeaux (March 8), and was finally driven eastward towards Toulouse,
intending to act in union with Suchet, whose army in Catalonia was as yet
unbeaten. On the heights upon the east of Toulouse, for Wellington had
brought his army across the Garonne, was fought, with somewhat
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_BATTLE_OF_TOULOUSE" id="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_BATTLE_OF_TOULOUSE"></a>Battle of Toulouse. April 10, 1814.</span>
doubtful result, the great battle of Toulouse. The victory has been
claimed by both parties; the aim of the English general was however won,
the Garonne was passed, the French position taken, Toulouse evacuated
and occupied by the victors. The triumph such as it was had cost the
victors 7000 or 8000 men, a loss of life which might have been spared,
for Napoleon had already abdicated, and the battle was entirely useless.
This was the last action of the Peninsula War, in which, after years of
steadfast resistance, the English had at length triumphantly swept the
French from the Peninsula, and done their full share in the great events
which temporarily closed the career of Napoleon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Long tenure of power of the Tory party.</div>

<p>The negotiations which had terminated in the abdication of
Napoleon had, as far as England was concerned, been
carried on by the same ministry which had had the
duty of conducting the war. The Tory party which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1322" id="Page_1322">[1322]</a></span>
the French Revolution and the policy of Pitt had called into
existence, robbed of the better and more liberal elements which
the presence of Pitt himself and his friends had introduced into
it, had succeeded in spite of its defects and of various opportunities
for a change in continuing its hold upon the Government. There
was at first one important member of it who kept up something
<span class="sidenote">Policy of Canning.</span> of the views of
Pitt. This was Canning, the Foreign Minister. But the presence of so
incongruous an element tended rather to the weakness than to the strength
of the administration; nor is it certain that in the present crisis of
Europe his views were such as to render him the most efficient minister.
Castlereagh, a man of narrower views and of much inferior talent, acted
as War Minister. Between him and Canning a strong antagonism arose.
Canning's errors were those of a liberal and noble mind. He was anxious
to see the Spaniards carry out their insurrection as much as possible
by their own means, and the wish led him to believe the false tales of
their patriotism and resources with which the braggart spirit of the
Spaniards supplied him. This credulity was strengthened by the reports
of Mr. Frere, whom he had sent to the Peninsula as ambassador, and he
was thus induced to misapply the wealth of England, and to misuse the
opportunities which his position as Foreign Minister gave him, so as
seriously to weaken the hands of Wellington. His desire for the political
regeneration of Spain blinded him somewhat to the military necessities
of the time, which required that our general should be invested with
almost absolute authority, and the arrangement of political matters
postponed till after the favourable conclusion of the war. But though
he thus not unfrequently <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_NINE_QUARREL_OF_CASTLEREAGH" id="EIGHTEEN_NINE_QUARREL_OF_CASTLEREAGH"></a>Canning's quarrel with
Castlereagh.</span> threw obstacles in Wellington's way, Canning by no
means approved of the inefficient administration of Castlereagh, and the
constant starvation of the military side of the Peninsula War. So far had
the quarrel with the War Minister extended that Canning had contrived,
not perhaps so openly and straightforwardly as could be wished, to extort
from the Prime Minister a promise that Lord Castlereagh should be removed
from his responsible situation, failing which he declared that he would
himself withdraw. His support was so necessary to the Prime Minister that
he had persuaded him to remain in office. But Canning had throughout
privately expressed the strongest disapprobation of the Walcheren
expedition, and when its failure became known, and when inquiries upon
the subject brought to light the fact that, while sitting in the same
Cabinet with Castlereagh, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1323" id="Page_1323">[1323]</a></span>
been in fact intriguing for his dismissal, the quarrel came to a point.
Sharp words were exchanged between the ministers, and the consequence
was a duel (Sept. 22), in which Canning was slightly wounded.
It was of course impossible for the antagonists to serve
longer in the same ministry. They both resigned, and their
example was followed by the Duke of Portland, whose failing
health had from the first rendered him unfit for his position,
and whose weakness was exhibited in allowing so grave a quarrel
to spring up within the limits of his Cabinet. It became necessary
to reconstitute the ministry, and after a fruitless negotiation with
<span class="sidenote">Reconstruction of the ministry. Oct. 1809.</span>
Lords Grey and Grenville&mdash;with so little reality in it
that Grey did not think it worth his while to come
to London on the subject&mdash;Perceval, who had long
been the most important person in the Cabinet, assumed the
nominal direction, and Lord Wellesley, who had lately been serving
as ambassador in Spain, where he had superseded Mr. Frere, was
induced to accept the ministry of foreign affairs. Lord Castlereagh
was succeeded by Lord Liverpool at the War Office, with Lord
Palmerston as under secretary. The reconstruction of the ministry
made no difference in its general tendencies. The introduction of
Lord Wellesley was indeed a slight improvement; he entered the
ministry chiefly for the purpose of supporting his brother's views in
the Peninsula. This to the best of his abilities he did, but he was
constantly thwarted by the mediocre men with whom he was joined,
and with whom he was never able to work comfortably. By far the
ablest and best writer in the Cabinet, his despatches were constantly
criticised and altered. His colleagues could not understand the
greatness of the openings afforded in the Peninsula, and after two
years of office he withdrew (Feb. 19, 1812). The opportunity
occurred in a great ministerial crisis caused by the renewed insanity
<span class="sidenote">Continuation of the same ministry till
1827.</span> of the King, which it was believed must have produced
a change of ministry. The Regent, however, retained Mr. Perceval in
office, and upon his death Lord Liverpool was called to succeed him,
and continued in office till 1827, so that in fact from the fall of
the Grenville ministry to that date, though with some change in the
<i>personnel</i>, there was a continuance of the Tory rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TEN_ILLNESS_OF_THE_KING" id="EIGHTEEN_TEN_ILLNESS_OF_THE_KING"></a>Illness of the King. Nov. 1810.</div>

<p>In November 1810 the King, who had never thoroughly got over
the failure of the Walcheren expedition, and the disgrace of Lord
Chatham and the Duke of York, was still further shaken
by the death of the Princess Amelia, and before long it
appeared that he had become hopelessly insane. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1324" id="Page_1324">[1324]</a></span>
several prorogations it was resolved (December 20) that it was the
duty of Parliament to supply the existing defect in the organization
of Government. A precedent for the action of the ministry was
drawn from Pitt's conduct under similar circumstances in 1788. It
was determined to reproduce, though in a somewhat modified form,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_THE_REGENCY_BILL" id="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_THE_REGENCY_BILL"></a>The Regency Bill. Feb. 1811.</span> the
restrictions then laid upon the power of the Regent. But the Prince of
Wales was by no means disposed to submit to these restrictions, and
induced his brothers to join in a protest against them. Nor did the
Opposition fail to see the probable advantage which would accrue to them
from a more unlimited regency; they regarded it as certain that Grenville
and Grey would be called to office, and they had no wish to curtail the
power of the Crown when wielded by men ready to rectify the mismanagement
under which they thought the country was suffering. But their hopes were
destined to be speedily extinguished. In spite of his protest the Bill
restricting the Regent was passed (Feb. 5), and the Prince took the
oaths before the Privy Council. He had already made up his mind that
it would be better to continue the present ministry, for a personal
quarrel had arisen between him and his Whig friends. He had requested
Grenville and Grey to draw up a reply to addresses from the two Houses
which had been presented to him in January. They had found considerable
difficulty in complying with his request, for Grenville had been a member
of Pitt's ministry when he restricted the regency in 1788, while Grey
then as now was a member of the Opposition; but by careful suppression
of the difficulties, a reply was drawn out and submitted to the Prince.
Such a compromise was not what he had expected; he summoned his friend
Sheridan to assist him in criticising the reply. The paper was returned
with pungent and witty marginal remarks, and a wholly different form of
reply suggested. The Whig Lords took umbrage at the levity and rudeness
of the Prince, and did not refrain from expressing their anger, a line
of conduct which, as might have been expected, in the case of a man of
such selfish and merely personal politics as the Prince, was warmly
resented. Moreover, the flattery of the Queen, and the adhesion to him
of his brothers, who wished for the <span class="sidenote">The Perceval
ministry continued.</span> continuation of the Perceval ministry,
together with the falsely hopeful reports of the physicians, which led
him to think that his regency would be a short one, induced him to accept
the situation; and immediately after having taken the oaths he declared
his intention to retain Mr. Perceval. Although at first expressing his
dislike to his ministers, before long entirely won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1325" id="Page_1325">[1325]</a></span>
over by their courtly language, he began to speak of his old friends
as "the wicked politicians." The regency was at first fixed for one
year only. At the end of that time, that is, in February 1812, after
a few more overtures to the Whig Lords to form a coalition with his
present ministry, which he must have known was impossible, the
Prince allowed the ministry to continue as before, Castlereagh being
readmitted to office, and Lord Sidmouth becoming President of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWELVE_ASSASSINATION_OF_PERCEVAL" id="EIGHTEEN_TWELVE_ASSASSINATION_OF_PERCEVAL"></a>Assassination of Mr. Perceval. May 1812.</span>
Council. The joy of Mr. Perceval at the happy issue of the affair was
proportionate to the fear he had felt at the thought of losing office;
but it was destined to be shortlived, for on the 11th of May, as he
entered the House of Commons, he was assassinated by a lunatic of the
name of Bellingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Liverpool made Premier.</div>

<p>Again there was much negotiation, and an attempt to introduce Lord
Wellesley and Mr. Canning to the ministry. Of course they could not
serve with Castlereagh; they were then asked to form a ministry with
Grenville and Grey, but these Lords objected to the Peninsula War, to
which Wellesley was pledged. Grenville and Grey then attempted a ministry
of their own, but quarrelled with Lord Moira on the appointments to the
Household; and as an American war was threatening, and the ministry had
already given up their Orders in Council (one of the chief causes of
their unpopularity), the Regent, rather than remain longer without a
ministry, intrusted Lord Liverpool with the premiership, with Castlereagh
as his Foreign Secretary, and the old ministry remained in office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War with America. May 1812.</div>

<p>Before the day of triumph of this ministry arrived, while Napoleon was
still at the height of his power, and the success of Wellington as yet
uncertain, England had drifted into war with America. It is difficult
to believe that this useless war might not have been avoided had the
ministers been men of ability. It arose from the obstinate manner in
which the Government clung to the execution of their retaliatory measures
against France, regardless of the practical injury they were inflicting
upon all neutrals. The causes of irritation have already been mentioned.
America, adopting the policy of England, had proceeded to retaliate; an
embargo was laid upon trade both with England and France, and commercial
relations with Europe practically broken off. An attempted arrangement
between the two countries in 1809 had produced but little result. But
though foreign trade had diminished, the demand for home manufactures
in America had largely increased; the populations of the Northern and
Eastern States were therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1326" id="Page_1326">[1326]</a></span>
satisfied with the existing state of things and decidedly averse to war,
with its certain expenditure and probable injury to their manufactures.
In the South the case was different. Without manufactures to supply the
loss sustained by the restricted export of their tobacco and sugar, not
in immediate contact with English territory, as were the Northern States,
and led by an aristocratic and slave-owning race, the Whites of the South
were inclined to war. The Presidents were Virginians, the Southerners had
a superiority in Congress, and in May of 1812 it became plain that war
must result unless the Orders in Council were repealed. But England was
in confusion owing to the assassination of Perceval, and it was not till
the middle of June, when war had been already declared, that Brougham's
motion for the withdrawal of the Orders was carried. The concession,
awkwardly made in the face of the American threats, came too late. The
Americans had already made up their minds, and planned an invasion of
Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of the war.</div>

<p>It was a war without great events. The attempts of the Americans upon
Canada failed. Here and there a slight success attended the English arms,
and the deep anger of our enemies was moved by the irksome blockade
of their coast, and the employment of the savage Indian tribes as our
allies. But if fairly successful on land, the English were to their great
astonishment thoroughly worsted upon the sea. Ship after ship was taken
by the American frigates. Nor was it till our commanders consented to
recognise the fact that the classification of the two navies was wholly
different, and that an American frigate was in tonnage and weight of
metal a match for an English fifty-gun ship, that these disasters were
brought to an end. It was an additional blow to the pride of England that
the sailors by whom her ships were defeated were largely drawn from her
own people. From the wretchedness prevalent in England, from high taxes,
commercial difficulties, and the severe laws of impressment, men fled for
refuge to America; and it is said that as many as 16,000 Englishmen were
serving on board the American fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempted negotiations.</div>

<p>The war was really so causeless and so prejudicial to the success
of the allies in Europe, that the Emperor of Russia attempted, in
1813, to bring it to a close by mediation, and although his offer was
declined, a negotiation was entered into at Ghent which ultimately proved
successful. But before the negotiators advanced far in their labours the
war threatened to assume a more serious character. On the cessation of
hostilities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1327" id="Page_1327">[1327]</a></span>
the south of France, a considerable number of the English troops
were embarked at Bordeaux direct for America, without even being
allowed to return home, and increased energy began to show itself
in all directions. A large fleet under Rear-Admiral Cockburn, and
a body of troops under General Ross, were despatched to the Chesapeake,
and a combined attack by land and water was made upon
Washington, the Federal capital. The success of the expedition,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_CAPTURE_OF_WASHINGTON" id="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_CAPTURE_OF_WASHINGTON"></a>Capture of Washington.</span> which was complete,
was stained by the destruction of all public property, offices, and
buildings in the city. An outcry was raised, not only in America but in
Europe, at what was regarded as an act of vandalism. It is said that the
English Government had ordered it as a retaliation for the barbarities
of the Americans on the Canadian frontier, and as it is confessed that
private property was scrupulously spared, it may well be a question
whether in fact such a destruction of national property is not a better
manner of exhibiting the severity of war than the destruction of private
property which so constantly attends it.</p>

<p>The capture of Washington was followed by other expeditions of a like
nature with less satisfactory results. Large and systematic operations
against a continent are at all times difficult, and certainly they were
beyond the capacity of the English ministry as then constituted. They
relapsed into all the old errors of the American War, and the military
operations were reduced to mere piratical excursions. An effort was
indeed made upon the only side where a base of operations existed, but
on so small a scale and so badly directed as to be entirely useless. A
combined attack by land and water was arranged against Plattsburg upon
Lake Champlain. The dilatoriness of the commander, Sir George Prevost,
allowed the flotilla to begin the fight unaided; it was completely
beaten, and its destruction putting an end to all hope of success, the
army withdrew. An attack on Baltimore met with no better fate, but the
greater part of the province of Maine was taken and occupied. The arrival
of the Peninsula troops, no longer well commanded, had produced but
little effect; the negotiations at Ghent were gradually drawing to a
conclusion. The Convention was signed on the 24th of December. It was,
as might be expected from the temper of the two nations, little more
than a compromise. The real points at issue were scarcely touched, the
boundaries were left for future negotiation. Such as it was it came too
late to save England from one more disaster. An expedition similar in
character to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1328" id="Page_1328">[1328]</a></span>
already mentioned had been directed against New Orleans. The place
was vigorously defended by General Jackson. Natural difficulties and
mismanagement met the English at every turn. The earth was too sandy to
allow of redoubts; while the Americans used cotton bales, which answered
admirably as defences, the English found nothing better than barrels of
sugar and molasses. When the storming parties reached the enemy's lines
they found that their fascines and scaling-ladders had been neglected;
the assault became impracticable. As the approach of the town had been
completely exposed to the fire of the enemy, very heavy loss had been
sustained, three English generals, and among them Sir Edmund Pakenham,
had been killed, and Lambert, who had succeeded to the command, thought
it better to withdraw the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abdication of Napoleon.</div>

<p>The American War was thus still at its height when the ministry had
been called upon to arrange the fate of the late Conqueror of Europe.
When the allies, in their advance towards France, had assembled at
Frankfort, not yet certain of success, and conscious that their work
would be easy could they separate Napoleon's interests from those of
the nation, they had offered to negotiate at a general Congress upon
the fixed condition that France should abandon Italy, Holland, Germany
and Spain, and confine itself to its natural boundaries. Napoleon,
suspecting not without reason their intentions in accepting the
Congress, had refused the conditions. His refusal had been followed by
a very able proclamation of the allies, separating the interests of
the ruler from that of the people, and promising that France should
retain its just weight in the balance of nations. Conscious of the
effect of this declaration, which exactly suited the feelings of the
majority of Frenchmen, Napoleon hastened to accept the conditions. But
he was told it was too late. Traitors had already informed the allied
sovereigns that they were strong enough to avoid compromise. The great
campaign which followed had shown how much could yet be done by the
Emperor's genius. Again negotiations were opened at Châtillon; Napoleon
expressed the utmost readiness to accept the terms of Frankfort. But
the ultimatum of the allies had now risen, the Rhine boundary was no
longer to be conceded. Napoleon could not make up his mind to allow
France to issue from the war less than when he had first taken possession
of the Government. The Treaty of Châtillon was broken off and war was
again resumed; and as though to express the completeness of their
determination, the allied sovereigns entered into a treaty at Chaumont
(March 1), by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1329" id="Page_1329">[1329]</a></span>
they bound themselves together for twenty years, promised each to supply
150,000 men, to which England was to add a subsidy of £5,000,000. The
knowledge of this treaty made Napoleon feel that some desperate stroke
alone could save him. He passed with his forces into the rear of the
allies; he was nearer, as he himself said, to Vienna than they were to
Paris. The movement put them in great perplexity. To leave so formidable
a person upon their communications seemed too dangerous a step. Again
treason served them in good stead. Their friends in Paris, at the head
of whom was Talleyrand, urged them at once to move upon the capital.
Joseph Bonaparte, who had been left in charge there, with Marmont and
Mortier, fought a last battle before the very walls. Joseph lost heart,
and ordered the marshals to capitulate, the army was withdrawn behind
the city, and Paris was in the hands of the allies. This was fatal to
all Napoleon's hopes. He came to Fontainebleau, there found himself
gradually deserted, heard how his marshals one after the other had joined
the victorious allies, and on the 4th of April signed his abdication,
consenting to withdraw to the Isle of Elba, which was to be constituted
into a principality for his convenience. He was to be allowed 400
soldiers, his wife and child were to be placed in possession of Placentia
and Parma, and he was to retain the title of Emperor. In the settlement
of the affairs of France and Europe he was to have no voice. The last
stroke of ill-fortune seemed to have come upon him when his Austrian
wife, overpersuaded by her relations, deserted him, and set off with his
young son to Vienna. During his ten months' residence in the Isle of Elba
the settlement of Europe was being carried on by the diplomatists of all
the powers assembled at Vienna.</p>

<p>Thus the Tory ministry seemed at last to have reaped the fruit of
their lengthened efforts, and to have justified their long retention of
office. But we shall look in vain for any merit in their policy but
<span class="sidenote">General sketch of the Tory policy.</span> one,
and that is steadfastness. The accidental discovery, for it was little
more, of a general of surpassing genius had enabled them to hide
under his greatness their own mediocrity; his skill had covered their
constantly-repeated blunders, and fortune had supplied them with an enemy
whose enthusiastic self-confidence, arbitrary temper, and insatiable
ambition, had neutralized his transcendent genius, had forced upon
them allies whom their own skill could not have secured, and had even
alienated the people whose natural representative he was. With these
advantages they had been able to obtain that success which a fixed line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1330" id="Page_1330">[1330]</a></span>
policy even when itself erroneous not unfrequently secures. They had
raised England to a position of the highest importance, the success of
Europe against Napoleon was indisputably due to her. Yet it cannot be
said that they were urged by patriotic motives. Throughout their conduct
had been dictated by the interests of their class. They had recognized
in Napoleon the great subverter of old institutions, the arch-enemy of
the aristocratic order. It was in this capacity chiefly that they had
pursued him with such firm and undeviating hostility. Of the events
which took place during their ministry, of the successful skill and
bravery of soldiers and sailors, of the establishment of national
independence whether in England or on the Continent, all Englishmen
may be proud. Those who, reading history by the light of subsequent
events, still hold that a strong aristocratic element is a necessary
ingredient of constitutional liberty will admire their motives. But to
those who feel that growth and advance is the essential principle of
the life of a nation, and that those only are good governors who are
capable of understanding and of carrying out the necessities of advancing
civilization, their sole claim to respect (and that is after all no
small one) will be that they knew their own minds, and in spite of all
difficulties realized their object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Home government.</div>

<p>The same motive of class aggrandizement which detracts from the
virtue of the foreign policy of this ministry underlay the whole
administration of home affairs. There was an incapacity to look at public
affairs from any but a class or aristocratic point of view. The natural
consequence was a constantly increasing mass of discontent among the
lower orders, only kept in restraint by an overmastering fear felt by
all those higher in rank of the possible revolutionary tendencies of any
attempt at change. Much of the discontent was of course the inevitable
consequence of the circumstances in which England was placed, and for
which the Government was only answerable in so far as it created those
circumstances. At the same time it is impossible not to blame the
complacent manner in which the misery was ignored and the occasional
success of individual merchants and contractors regarded as evidences of
national prosperity. At the beginning of the year 1810, Perceval, who in
the interest of the Government had been preventing as far as possible all
inquiry into the Walcheren failure, was bold enough at the opening of the
session to take credit to himself for that expedition, and to declare
that the national prosperity was great, and that public works had been
carried out as successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1331" id="Page_1331">[1331]</a></span>
as in the times of profound peace. Such assertions could not have been
made without some slight foundation. While the Continental System and the
Orders in Council had together almost closed the European trade, certain
other irregular doors had been opened; the removal of the Portuguese
court to the Brazils had given hopes of an enlarged South American trade,
and the two islands of Heligoland and Anholt had been fortified and
turned into smuggling centres with some success. Certain public works, as
the Waterloo and Vauxhall bridges, had been opened. But before the year
was over the condition of the country surely proved that the prosperity
boasted of was a mere phantom. The American trade proved ruinous to those
who had rushed into it; the British goods on the Baltic had been seized
and confiscated; the public works had been carried on by a lavish issue
of paper money, which was now rapidly depreciating. A bad harvest came
to increase the difficulties of the time. Early in the spring wheat was
already at 102s. a quarter: though £7,000,000 worth was imported, it rose
in August to 116s. But then, under the influence of a good harvest, it
suddenly dropped to 94s.&mdash;thus the agricultural interest was also
involved in ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TEN_DEPRESSION_OF_TRADE" id="EIGHTEEN_TEN_DEPRESSION_OF_TRADE"></a>Depression of trade.</div>

<p>Under all these influences there was a collapse of credit. There
were 273 stoppages of payment instead of the ordinary average of 100,
and before the year was out no less than 2314 commissions of bankruptcy
were issued. This misery and depression lasted till the end of the
war. Indeed, in the following years, 1811 and 1812, it was constantly
increasing. The depression of commerce was so great and the collapse
of credit so general that an advance of £6,000,000 to the merchants on
due security was authorized by Parliament. The withdrawal of Russia
from the Continental System, and its apparent inclination to throw off
Napoleon's influence, slightly revived business. But this improvement was
neutralized by the fearful winter and spring, which destroyed much of the
harvest, and again raised the price of wheat. The apparent opposition
between the interests of the manufacturing and agricultural classes was
very curiously marked. A plentiful harvest in 1813, and the opening of
many continental ports, did much to revive both trade and manufactures;
but it was accompanied by a fall in the price of corn from 17ls. to 75s.
The consequence was widespread distress among the agriculturists, which
involved the country banks, so that in the two following years 240 of
them stopped payment. So great a crash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1332" id="Page_1332">[1332]</a></span>
could not fail to affect the manufacturing interest also; apparently
for the instant the very restoration of peace brought widespread
ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misery of the lower classes.</div>

<p>But whether for the moment it was the agriculturists or the merchants
who suffered most, the lower classes were quite sure to suffer. Not only
did the Continental System injure the great branches of English industry,
the foreign corn ports were also closed. The increase of population
since the large introduction of machinery in the last century had gone
beyond the resources of home production. The high price of wheat has been
already mentioned. Meat also went up from 4d. or 5d. to 10d. a pound.
Considering the enormous rate of the price of corn, it was impossible to
give wages sufficient to keep the operatives alive. Before the end of the
year 1811, wages had sunk to 7s. 6d. a week. The manufacturing operatives
were therefore in a state of absolute misery. Petitions signed by 40,000
or 50,000 men urged upon Parliament that they were starving; but there
was another class which fared still worse. Machinery had by no means
superseded hand-work. In thousands of hamlets and cottages handlooms
still existed. The work was neither so good nor so rapid as work done
by machinery; even at the best of times used chiefly as an auxiliary
to agriculture, this hand labour could now scarcely find employment at
all. Not unnaturally, without work and without food, these handworkers
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_THE_LUDDITE_RIOTS" id="EIGHTEEN_ELEVEN_THE_LUDDITE_RIOTS"></a>The Luddite riots.</span> were very ready to
believe that it was the machinery which caused their ruin, and so in
fact it was; the change, though on the whole beneficial, had brought
much individual misery. The people were not wise enough to see this.
They rose in riot in many parts of England, chiefly about Nottingham,
calling themselves Luddites (from the name of a certain idiot lad who
some thirty years before had broken stocking-frames), gathered round
them many of the disbanded soldiery with whom the country was thronged,
and with a very perfect secret organization, carried out their object of
machine-breaking. The unexpected thronging of the village at nightfall,
a crowd of men with blackened faces, armed sentinels holding every
approach, silence on all sides, the village inhabitants cowering behind
their closed doors, an hour or two's work of smashing and burning, and
the disappearance of the crowd as rapidly as it had arrived&mdash;such
were the incidents of the night riots.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the agricultural labourer was still worse off.
While farmers were selling their corn at 112s., or even at 170s., the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1333" id="Page_1333">[1333]</a></span>
quarter&mdash;while it paid to take in bits of open down land, get three
<span class="sidenote">Misery of the agricultural labourer.</span>
crops off it without manuring, and then pass on to the next
piece,&mdash;the wretched labourers were told that prices were so high
that but little could be given them for their wages. The misery was
therefore exceedingly great among them; and even worse than this, the
Poor Law stepped in and destroyed their characters. For the wages were so
low that they could not live on them, and they were forced to come upon
the parish; and the old Poor Law, in the hands of the farmer guardians,
enabled those very employers who kept the wages low to levy a rate upon
their parishes to support those people whom they were starving, and
to give outdoor relief in aid of wages. In other words, the employer
had the right to compel the country to give him the money to pay his
labourers enough to keep them alive. Selfish views, too, were mixed
with false political economy. Many labourers made cheap labour; many
hands, it was thought, made a strong country. So this strange grant
in aid of wages came to be apportioned according to the number of the
family of the recipient; and when the whole state of the nation pointed
to the necessity of a curtailed population, a premium was given for its
increase.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_DIFFICULTIES_ATTENDING_SETTLEMENT" id="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_DIFFICULTIES_ATTENDING_SETTLEMENT"></a>Difficulties attending the settlement of
Europe.</div>

<p>The termination of a war so new in its character, and so universal as
that which for the last eleven years had been wasting Europe, brought
with it great difficulties. On the one hand arose the question of the
position to be taken up by the allies with regard to France; on the
other, the reconstitution of Europe, completely dislocated by the policy
of Napoleon. Both questions were rendered difficult of solution by the
various interests and mutual jealousies of the powers of the victorious
coalition. But,&mdash;while those European powers who had suffered most
severely from the French arms, and especially Prussia, on which the
vengeance of Napoleon had fallen most heavily, were desirous to treat
France as a conquered nation, so to curtail its dimensions as to render
it harmless for the future, and to lay such burdens upon it as might
in some degree recompense them for their losses,&mdash;England, which
had never felt the sword of the conqueror, and Russia, ruled by a Czar
much influenced by notions of chivalry and magnanimity, had already
determined upon an opposite course. Following the opinion of the founder
of their party, the Tory Government which had succeeded Pitt declared its
intention of acting towards France as towards a friendly power, and of
allowing it to retain the same frontiers as in 1790. There was not much
magnanimity in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1334" id="Page_1334">[1334]</a></span>
conduct; the Tory party, the champions of legitimacy, could scarcely
avoid restoring the Bourbons; their view of the balance of Europe
rendered a powerful France almost a necessity; they could look for
no continental acquisitions for England, and took care to secure the
advantages they required for their maritime and commercial superiority
in other directions. But, while restoring the Bourbons, the English
Government found itself compelled by the temper of the time, the course
of circumstances, and the liberal views of the Emperor of Russia, to
restore them only upon conditions. A constitutional government was
granted to France, ratified by a charter securing the chief personal and
political rights of the people, such as the maintenance of the public
sales during the Revolution, freedom of religion, and freedom of the
press.</p>

<p>A France thus reconstituted, and holding friendly relations with
the other powers of Europe, would naturally claim its share in the
arrangements of the forthcoming Congress. It would probably have
been wiser had the French Government postponed all definite settlements
as to its future limits till that Congress met; the jealousies
which existed between the allies and their conflicting claims would
have afforded opportunity for securing favourable terms, for by the
Convention, by which France had surrendered the territories held by
her armies in Europe, her troops had been allowed to withdraw
unmolested, and a powerful army could have been rapidly reconstituted.
But the allies, guided by Metternich, the Austrian minister,
and determined to keep as far as possible the management of the
Congress in their own hands, insisted on the immediate conclusion
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Paris. May 1814.</span> of the treaty
with France. Eager to gain popularity by the establishment of peace, the
French Government yielded, and in May the Treaty of Paris was concluded.
It was upon the whole more favourable than France, as a conquered nation,
could have expected. The frontier of 1790 was even slightly increased:
towards the north and towards the Rhine it was advanced so as to include
several important fortresses, especially the strong place of Landau,
and towards the Alps about half of Savoy was also included. The demands
of Prussia for a contribution towards the expenses of the war were
rejected by the influence of Austria and England, and the treasures of
art collected by Napoleon's armies were allowed to remain in Paris. The
one great loss sustained was the Isle of France. It was upon the sea and
among the colonies that England looked for its reward; it retained Malta,
to secure its influence in the Mediterranean, the Cape of Good Hope,
which it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1335" id="Page_1335">[1335]</a></span>
won from the Dutch, and now, to complete its naval stations on the road
to India, it insisted on the surrender of the Isle of France. The bases
for the forthcoming Treaty of Vienna were also roughly laid by this
peace. The published articles declared the independence of the States
of Germany, the augmentation of Holland under the rule of the Prince of
Orange, the independence of Switzerland and of the Italian States outside
the limits of the Austrian possessions. Secret articles explained what
these loose expressions meant. Belgium was to form the promised increase
of Holland, and thus form with it a kingdom absolutely in the interest
of England; the left bank of the Rhine was to supply compensations for
the German princes (which meant that it was to be given to Bavaria in
exchange for the Tyrol); the Po, the Ticino, and Lago Maggiore were to
form the boundaries of Austrian Italy, which thus included the territory
of Venice; and Sardinia was to receive Genoa in exchange for the portion
of Savoy ceded to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit of the monarchs to England. Aug. 1814.</div>

<p>The difficulties which were sure to attend the forthcoming Congress
were already felt, and it was thought that the solution would be rendered
easier by the establishment of personal relations between the powers
of the coalition. The great monarchs of Eastern Europe were therefore
invited to visit the Prince Regent in England. The Emperor of Austria
declined to come, but the Czar and the King of Prussia accepted the
invitation, and were received with great pomp and enthusiasm. Several
weeks were passed in universal gaiety, but the political object of the
visit was not attained. The Czar seemed more than ever to occupy the
first place among crowned heads; and the dread of Russian influence, and
the determination to oppose its claims in the Congress, were thus only
rendered stronger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Congress at Vienna. Sept. 1814.</div>

<p>The meetings at Vienna, at first appointed for August, had been
postponed to September, and thither, after their visit to England, the
monarchs themselves, and the ministers who represented the various
countries of the Congress, betook themselves. The interests of England
were intrusted to Lord Castlereagh, a man of considerable firmness, but
of mediocre ability, without accurate knowledge or broad views of the
politics of Europe, and deficient in the conciliatory deportment so
necessary for a successful diplomatist. The negotiators approached their
difficult work in a spirit which promised no very good results. Almost of
necessity the character of the Congress, and of the treaty it produced,
belonged rather to the past than to the future. It was rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1336" id="Page_1336">[1336]</a></span>
necessary by the changes created by the French Revolution, and was
in the hands of a coalition called into existence to oppose the
Revolution, and consisting chiefly of monarchs whose views were both
absolutist and dynastic. The Czar alone had certain liberal tendencies,
but they were so mixed with personal ambition as to excite mistrust
instead of co-operation among the assembled negotiators. The Congress
therefore assumed the form of an old European congress. It was occupied
with the personal and peculiar interest of each sovereign, the increase
of territory and influence of each nation, instead of attempting a
settlement of Europe in accordance with any enlarged or general theory
suitable to the great change and growth of ideas which had been at once
the cause and effect of the Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The interests of the various countries at the
Congress.</div>

<p>As far as England was concerned, its interests had already been
chiefly secured by the Treaty of Paris. The new kingdom of the
Netherlands, it was thought, would be strong enough to hold the mouths
of the great rivers of that country, and thus prevent any revival of the
Continental System; the road to India was rendered safe by the possession
of the Cape of Good Hope and the Mauritius, while Malta guarded English
influence in the Mediterranean. The maintenance of the old European
balance was therefore the chief object which Castlereagh had now in view,
endangered chiefly by the overwhelming power of Russia, threatening alike
the countries of Europe and our own Asiatic dominions. The haste with
which the Treaty of Paris had been concluded tied the hands of France,
which was represented by Talleyrand; and the very moderate ambition of
Louis XVIII. limited the claims of that country to the completion of
the downfall of the Napoleonic system by the removal of Murat from the
kingdom of Naples, and the establishment of the Spanish Princess, the
Queen of Etruria, in the Duchy of Parma, which had been promised to Maria
Louisa, Napoleon's wife. Louis was also anxious to save if possible the
kingdom of Saxony from annihilation. The really important questions at
issue regarded the settlement of the East of Europe and the fate of
Poland and Saxony, which appeared indissolubly connected, so closely were
the Courts of Russia and Prussia united. The Emperor of Russia was a man
of enthusiastic temperament and liberal theories, and at the same time of
great ambition. He found satisfaction for both sides of his character in
a plan for the reconstitution of the kingdom of Poland, with a liberal
constitution, either under his own rule as king or under some prince
of his house acknowledging his supremacy. To complete this project he
required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1337" id="Page_1337">[1337]</a></span>
the possession of the whole of Poland, a reward which the overweening
value he set on his own services to the coalition induced him to regard
as by no means more than his due. Both Prussia and Austria would have
been called upon to restore certain portions of Poland which had fallen
to their lot in the different partition treaties, but he supposed that
his own resignation of certain portions would counterbalance these
sacrifices, while Austria would be well rewarded by the possession of
Lombardy and Venice, and Prussia by the whole of Saxony. The adhesion
of the Saxon king to Napoleon was thought to justify the sovereigns of
the coalition in confiscating his country, which, with the approbation
of Russia, was claimed in its entirety by the Prussian Government. It is
plain that the claims of Russia and Prussia could not but be in the last
degree objectionable to Austria. Absolutist in its tendencies, it cared
nothing for the freedom of Poland, while the possession of territory
conterminous with the hereditary states of Austria would render Russia a
most dangerous rival. At the same time, Prussia, the constant object of
Austrian jealousy, if Saxony passed into its hands, would at once lose
that broken and dislocated shape which had hitherto been its weakness,
and would acquire a position in Germany which Austria could scarcely hope
to equal. The policy of Austria was therefore clearly marked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The policy of England at the Congress.</div>

<p>The position of England was not so obvious. It is possible to say
now, guided by the light of subsequent events, and led by the spirit
of freedom and nationality which has made such vast strides of late
years, that the Government of England, the home of free institutions
and avowedly the champion of national liberty, should have come forward
even then in that capacity, should have rejoiced at the reconstitution
of Poland, and have sought the unification of Germany by supporting
the power of Prussia, and should have objected to the establishment
of Austria in Italy, a country where her rule was certain to be
disliked by the population. But the English Government at the time
was a Tory Government, bent rather upon restraining than increasing
popular tendencies, and under the dominion of three overmastering
influences&mdash;the desire to secure England from any possibility of a
renewal of the Continental System, an extreme jealousy of the pretensions
and power of the Russian Emperor, and the wish to establish for some
years at all events the peace of Europe. Its policy was therefore
inconsistent and shortsighted, but sensible and practical; the fear of
the advance of Russia made the English ministry blind to its duties
towards Poland; the satisfaction and friendship of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1338" id="Page_1338">[1338]</a></span>
were more important than the rights of Genoa; the immediate balance of
the powers of Germany was more important than the national aspirations
either of Italy or of Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The policy of France.</div>

<p>It so happened that the views of France were at this instant similar
to those of England. Before the formal opening of the Congress an attempt
had been made by the four great powers to get the management of it
entirely into their own hands. France would thus have been excluded from
the settlement of Europe; but Talleyrand was not a man to hear quietly
such an exclusion; he appeared as the champion of the smaller states,
and succeeded in thwarting the efforts of the great powers. This, with
other less important causes, had embroiled him with the Emperor of
Russia, whose objects he was thus bent on thwarting. The King of Saxony
was a friend and relative of Louis XVIII.; to save him and his country
from destruction was a part of the French programme. It therefore suited
Talleyrand to adopt the views of Castlereagh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division of the Congress.</div>

<p>Thus Austria, France, and England, in conjunction with the smaller
German powers, who looked with great dislike to the annihilation of one
of the chief among them, were thrown upon one side, in opposition to
Russia and Prussia. The arrogant and high-handed manner in which those
two powers proceeded to take temporary possession of the countries
which they claimed still further excited the anger of their opponents.
So severe did the dispute grow, so indissoluble did the knot appear,
that war between the powers themselves seemed threatening. The Treaty
of Ghent and the conclusion of the English war with America allowed
Castlereagh to act with more vigour, and in January a secret treaty
was entered into between France, Austria, and England, by which each
country agreed to supply troops to compel, if necessary, the adoption
of their combined policy. Although this treaty was kept a secret, the
firm attitude and the combination of the three powers were so evident
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FIFTEEN_COMPROMISE_AGREED" id="EIGHTEEN_FIFTEEN_COMPROMISE_AGREED"></a>Compromise agreed to.</span> that, as neither
party really wished for war, a compromise was discovered. About half
of Saxony, with a third of its population, was taken from the King and
given to Prussia, while the Czar, withdrawing from his extreme demand
with regard to Poland, allowed the Duchy of Posen to remain in the hands
of the Prussians, and a considerable portion of Gallicia, together
with the district of Tarnopol, to be retained by Austria, while Krakow
was to become a free and neutral republic. Poland was thus in part
reconstituted, but entirely in the hands of Russia. These great questions
being settled, the arrangements upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1339" id="Page_1339">[1339]</a></span>
minor points proceeded with some rapidity; the left bank of the Rhine was
given to Bavaria; Genoa passed into the hands of Sardinia; the two houses
of Hesse were re-established; Luxemburg was given to the Low Countries;
Mayence became a Federal fortress; the Tyrol was restored to Austria;
Switzerland was reorganized chiefly in accordance with the arrangements
France had made there; the conduct of Murat, who began to show a tendency
towards Napoleonism, facilitated the restoration of the Bourbons in
Naples; Parma was given to Maria Louisa for her life; and the Congress
completed its work by two great declarations of principle, one securing
the freedom of the navigation of rivers, the other expressing, what was
very dear to Englishmen at the time, a universal disapprobation of the
slave trade.</p>



<p>Before the conclusion of these questions Castlereagh had been
compelled by the meeting of Parliament to return to England, and the
Duke of Wellington had taken his place at Vienna. His work there was
not completed when the news arrived that Napoleon had
<span class="sidenote">Escape of Napoleon from Elba.</span> broken
loose from Elba, and the Duke was wanted to take command of the allied
army in Belgium. The renewal of the common danger produced a temporary
harmony among the negotiators at Vienna. The chief questions were rapidly
settled, and a joint proclamation, issued by the eight powers which had
signed the Peace of Paris, declared Napoleon the public enemy of Europe.
The Congress continued its sittings, but military preparations for the
time absorbed all attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military preparations against Napoleon.</div>

<p>It was agreed to act in accordance with the Treaty of Chaumont, each
of the four great powers supplying its quota of troops, or in the case of
England an equivalent in money. While the Prussians and the English with
their allies were to advance into France and the Netherlands, the other
powers were to pass the Rhine and join in a great advance upon Paris. It
was hoped that by the end of April 500,000 men would be ready for the
great movement. The French Court had taken refuge in the Netherlands,
and as the people of that country were already half inclined to join
the French, it seemed certain that that country would be the chief seat
of operations; the war there was intrusted to the Anglo-allies under
Wellington, and the Prussians under Prince Blücher. The hope of speedy
action was quickly seen to be vain. Since the peace many countries had
disbanded their troops, many of the best English regiments had been sent
to America, and in spite of its long experience, the English Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1340" id="Page_1340">[1340]</a></span>
showed its usual weakness in the war administration. Wellington
was convinced of the necessity of postponing the opening of the
campaign till June or July.</p>

<p>This delay gave Napoleon an opportunity of striking the first
blow, and although he could immediately dispose of not more
than 125,000 men, and although the English and Prussian armies
amounted to 220,000, the arrangement of the allied troops gave
him much hope of a successful campaign. Bent upon covering
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon enters Belgium.</span> Brussels,
uncertain where the blow which he felt sure would soon be struck would
fall and in order to facilitate the subsistence of his troops, Wellington
had spread his army over a long line of frontier, from the neighbourhood
of Charleroi to Antwerp and Ostend. In like manner the Prussian corps
were spread eastward from Charleroi to Liège. Trusting to the wide
dissemination of the allied troops to render concentration difficult,
Napoleon thought to push between the English and Prussian armies, and
to crush them one after the other. With all his old skill, he rapidly
collected his army on the Sambre, issued on the 14th June a stirring
general order, and on the 15th attacked the Prussians at Charleroi,
passed the Sambre, and drove them back along the Namur road to a position
near Sombreffe, which Blücher had already appointed as a point of
concentration should he be attacked from Charleroi. At the same time the
left of the French army under Ney was sent directly northward along the
road to Brussels, to clear it of English and prevent the junction of the
allies.</p>

<p>Up to this point Napoleon's plans seemed thoroughly successful.
He had already rendered any immediate junction of the armies
difficult, if not impossible; with one part of his army he had
already reached the chosen ground of the Prussians, and found it
occupied by one only out of their four corps; with his left he had
advanced to the position of Quatre Bras against the English, where
as yet no considerable portion of the allies had arrived. But a strange
slowness marks his course in this campaign. Instead of bringing
up all his troops for an attack in both directions, in the early
morning of the 16th, he allowed his main body to pass the night on
the Sambre, while there was an interval of twelve miles between
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Ligny.</span> Ney's position and that of
his rear. Consequently all the morning was passed in bringing up these
troops, and it was past noon before either at Quatre Bras or Ligny any
formidable attacks were made on the enemy. During that time two more
Prussian corps had arrived at Ligny, and Wellington's troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1341" id="Page_1341">[1341]</a></span>
were hastening to support the small force at Quatre Bras. Napoleon
therefore, instead of being able to destroy a single Prussian corps,
found himself involved in a bloody and hard-contested battle. He
was indeed victorious, but the victory was not of that crushing and
decisive character which his precarious position rendered necessary
<span class="sidenote">Battle of Quatre Bras.</span> for him. At Quatre
Bras, instead of a brief skirmish which would have enabled him to give
assistance to Napoleon at Ligny, Ney found it necessary to fight a
battle, and that not a successful one. The Allies, who in the morning
were scarcely 8000 strong, made good their position till reinforcements
arrived. When evening closed their preponderance was such that Ney was
compelled to withdraw his troops to Frasnes. So hard had he been pressed
that he had found it necessary to summon to his aid the corps of D'Erlon,
which almost at the same time received orders from Napoleon to fall
on the Prussian right flank, and thus complete the victory of Ligny.
Confused by these contradictory orders, D'Erlon's corps of 20,000 men
passed the day, without striking a blow, between the two battlefields,
in either of which his presence might have had a decisive effect. As it
was, Napoleon overrated the success against the Prussians, and fell into
a fatal error with regard to the line of their retreat. Convinced that
they would fall back towards Namur and Liège, he detached Marshal Grouchy
with 30,000 men to follow <span class="sidenote">Retreat of Blücher's
army.</span> them in that direction, while he himself brought his main
body to join Ney, with the intention of following and destroying the
English, who were compelled by Blücher's defeat to fall back towards
Brussels. But the Prussian generals, Blücher and Gneisenau, the chief
of his staff, were not so easily shaken off. Determined still to afford
assistance to their allies, they withdrew northwards towards Wavre,
while Grouchy and his troops were in vain seeking them towards the east.
From Wavre, which was reached late in the evening of the 17th, Blücher
was enabled to assure Wellington of his approach, and to promise the
assistance not of two divisions only, for which the English general
had asked, but of his whole army. Relying on this promise, Wellington
determined to fight.</p>

<p>To give time for the arrival of the Prussians it was necessary that
his battle should be a defensive one. The position, which he had long
before studied and selected, was admirably adapted for the purpose.
Nearly two miles south of Waterloo is the village of St. Jean, where the
highroads from Charleroi and Nivelle towards Brussels join. Just south of
this the undulating country forms a somewhat continuous ridge, lying east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1342" id="Page_1342">[1342]</a></span>
and west, crossed at right angles by the Charleroi road. Along the south
of the ridge lies a rich and cultivated valley, which in about a mile
swells again into a corresponding range of elevated ground. Three or four
farmhouses lie on the foot or on the southern slope of the northern line
of hills, so that the position resembles, as Wellington said, a wall of
a bastion with advancing angles. The English troops were placed along
the ridge, and occupied the farmhouses. The centre was placed between
the two highroads, having in front the farm of La Haye Sainte standing
on the western side of the Charleroi road. The right was covered by the
château of Hougomont, with stone buildings and enclosures, while the left
stretched to the farms of Papelotte and La Haye. Wavre is about seven
miles from St. Jean, directly to the east, and expecting the arrival of
Blücher, Wellington allowed his left to be the weakest part of his line.
His care for his right was indeed exaggerated; he thought it possible
that an attempt might be made to reach Brussels by outflanking him in
that direction, and before all things desirous of preserving the capital,
he detached a body of 17,000 men to Hal (eight miles to the west of his
position), and thus seriously and uselessly weakened his line of battle.
The French position corresponded to the English. Its centre also lay on
the Charleroi road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1343" id="Page_1343">[1343]</a></span>
and the range of heights parallel to those occupied by the English,
on which is the farmhouse of La Belle Alliance. Its right extended to
Frischermont, opposite to La Haye, having somewhat in its rear the
village of Planchenoit; the left reached beyond Hougomont. In number the
armies were not unequally matched. Wellington commanded about 68,000 men,
Napoleon 70,000, but the English army consisted of troops of various
nations, some of whom were thoroughly untrustworthy, and was inferior in
cavalry by at least 3000 men, and in artillery by upwards of 100 guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Waterloo.</div>

<p>By eight o'clock on the morning of the 18th the English were under
arms, but Napoleon, ignorant of the movements of the Prussians, and
anxious probably to excite the temper of his own troops, and display
his power to those of the allies who were already wavering in their
allegiance, delayed his attack till nearly mid-day, and employed the
morning in a great review of his troops. The weather also on the 17th had
been very stormy, the ground was saturated and heavy; and though this
difficulty would likewise have affected his opponents, firm ground was no
doubt more important for the attack than for the defence. It is probable
that those wasted hours saved the English army, for the same condition of
the ground told with terrible force upon the advance of the Prussians,
who had to make their way through swampy defiles, where the artillery
could scarcely be moved. Their advance was very slow, and nothing but
the firm determination of their leaders to keep their word to Wellington
would have enabled them to overcome the obstacles in their way. The
battle began about half-past eleven by an assault upon Hougomont, which
Napoleon intended to carry, and thus mask his real great attack upon the
centre and left of the English. The firm resistance of the garrison,
consisting of a portion of the English Guards and the troops of Nassau
and Hanover, frustrated this first move. The capture of the château,
which should have been a mere preliminary step in the great plan, became
an object in itself; fresh troops were constantly brought against it, it
was as constantly reinforced from the English line, and throughout the
whole day its defence neutralized a considerable portion of the French
infantry. It was not till five o'clock that Napoleon brought a couple of
howitzers to bear upon it. Though the buildings were speedily in flames,
the defence was continued, and it remained throughout the day uncaptured.
During the first attack upon Hougomont skirmishing and firing had been
going on along the whole line preparatory to the great movement against
the left. That movement was rather hastened than postponed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1344" id="Page_1344">[1344]</a></span>
by a discovery which was made about one o'clock. About that time troops
were seen moving near a wood to the north-east of the English position
between Wavre and Ohain. At first Napoleon took them for the troops
of Grouchy, to whom he had sent information of the true direction of
the Prussian retreat. They proved however to be the foremost troops
of Bülow's Prussian corps. But the Emperor, still believing that
Grouchy would at all events prevent the arrival of the main body of the
Prussians, determined if possible to complete the destruction of the
English before taking notice of the approaching troops. At half-past
one, under a furious cannonade, the first corps, D'Erlon's, marched
against the English left between Papelotte and La Haye Sainte. Although
their peculiar formation, in great closely-packed masses, exposed them
fearfully to the fire of the English artillery, they pressed forward
up the English slope, threw the first line, consisting of allies, into
confusion, and were not repulsed till Picton brought up the main body
of the English left, who charged them with the bayonet and drove them
backward. As they were already shaken, the English heavy cavalry, the
Household Brigade, and what is known as the Union Brigade, consisting
of the Scotch Greys, the Enniskillen Dragoons, and Royals, charged with
fearful effect. Carried away by their energy, they rode right up the
French slope to the battery of La Belle Alliance; scattered and exhausted
by their charge, they were fallen upon and very roughly handled by the
French Lancers, and only saved from destruction by the advance of the
English light cavalry. However, the first great attack of the French had
been triumphantly repulsed, though with terrible loss. Both Picton and
Ponsonby, who commanded the cavalry, were killed. It was not long before
a second attack was made. Apparently about four o'clock, Ney was ordered
to assault the centre and right centre of the English to the west of
the Charleroi road. The attack was made chiefly with cavalry. Much of
the infantry were indeed employed round Hougomont and in the attack of
La Haye Sainte, which never ceased. For two hours the cavalry charges
continued; they were opposed by the allied troops thrown into square, the
squares being placed checkerwise behind the crest of the ridge. It is
uncertain whether any squares were broken; it is certain at all events
that though the line on the whole held firm, reinforcements had to be
brought from the right, and that there was a moment between five and
six o'clock when the centre was in the greatest danger. After an heroic
defence La Haye Sainte had been abandoned for want of ammunition. The
French held therefore a position close to the English ridge, and the
infantry of Donzelot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1345" id="Page_1345">[1345]</a></span>
division were gradually making their way to the line which the cavalry
charge had shattered. But to complete the lodgment effected in the line
on the ridge more infantry were absolutely necessary, and these were not
forthcoming. When Ney sent to demand them of the Emperor, his messenger
was met with the reply, "Does he want me to make them?" In fact, since
about half-past four o'clock the advance of the Prussians had made
itself clearly felt. General Lobau had been sent to check them, and
with him some battalions of the Imperial Guard. But the numbers of the
Prussians constantly increased; it was in vain that they were more than
once driven out of Planchenois by the Guard, at six o'clock they had
established themselves there, threatening even the rear of the French and
the Charleroi road, their line of retreat; and by seven o'clock Ziethen's
corps, which had pushed directly westward, had joined the left of the
English army, so that the French troops in Papelotte occupied an advanced
angle, surrounded both in front and flank by the enemy. It was thus that
reinforcements could not be sent to Ney, and the second great effort of
the French was rendered useless. But Napoleon did not yet give up all for
lost. He knew that the English must be much exhausted, and determined to
try one great effort more with that portion of the Imperial Guard which
had still been kept in reserve. It was a general assault along the whole
line, but the most important part of it was the advance of the Guard
upon the English centre. To oppose them the English brigade of Guards
under Maitland had been brought forward. As the French columns topped
the ridge the Guards sprang to their feet, and at a distance of fifty
paces poured in a fire which shook the advancing masses, and charged
them with the bayonet. The columns of the Guard rolled backward to the
valley. At the same time a second column had met with the same fate; the
52nd regiment under Colborne had advanced so as to form an angle with the
main line; as the French column passed them they poured in a destructive
fire, and charged directly upon their flank. The course of that charge
was unchecked, the 52nd regiment continued to follow the flying French
right across the valley. Almost at the same time, the French in the
angle at Papelotte had also been driven back by the Prussians; and the
English light cavalry under Vandelour and Vivian had likewise charged,
overthrowing the troops opposed to them; thus in three parts of the field
the French were in flight. A general order to advance was given, and
after a short but broken resistance, the whole mass of the French army
fled in complete rout. About nine o'clock Wellington and Blücher met at
the farmhouse of La Belle Alliance, lately the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1346" id="Page_1346">[1346]</a></span>
French headquarters. The pursuit was intrusted to the Prussians, less
exhausted than their English allies, and was followed up by Gneisenau
along the Charleroi road as far as Frasnes. The loss in this great battle
was very heavy on all sides; that of England is put at 13,000, that of
Prussia at 7000, and of France between 23,000 and 30,000. It was however
decisive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The allies in Paris.</div>

<p>The advance of the allies into France was unchecked, and on the
7th of July Paris was again occupied. The entrance of
the allies upon the country of France at once exhibited
the different feelings by which they were actuated; while Blücher
and the Prussians thought of nothing but vengeance, Wellington,
true to the constant policy of England, insisted upon regarding
France as a friendly country to which he was restoring its legitimate
sovereign. He succeeded in restraining his violent colleague, who
wished to put Napoleon to death, to lay a large contribution on Paris,
and to blow up the bridge of Jena over the Seine, the name of which
he considered an insult to Prussia. Wellington had no instructions
how to act with regard to Napoleon, he therefore allowed him
to follow his own course. The Emperor, embarking in an English
frigate, the Bellerophon, attempted in his usual theatrical manner to
claim the hospitality of the Prince Regent, but the dread of his name
and ambition, and the proved danger of allowing him to remain in
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon banished to St. Helena.</span> Europe,
prevented the English Government from entertaining any such ideas, and
Napoleon was sent to end his days as a prisoner in St. Helena.</p>

<p>The influence of England, naturally increased by the great part it
had played in the war in Belgium, was sufficient to give the direction
to the negotiations which followed the second restoration of the
<span class="sidenote">Second Treaty of Paris. Nov. 20, 1815.</span>
Bourbons. The Government succeeded in procuring that the Treaty of Vienna
completed on June 9th and the first Treaty of Paris (May 1814) should
be upon the whole maintained, but it could not refuse to allow some
punishment to fall on France for the events of "the hundred days." The
country was vigorously confined to its limits in 1790, losing all the
additions which the first Treaty of Paris had given it; it was compelled
to bear much of the expenses of the war; while its immediate good conduct
was secured by an army of occupation, which was for five years to hold
the northern fortresses under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The
war contribution was to consist of 700,000,000 francs, a sum which was
to be paid in five years, during which time the northern fortresses were
held as guarantee. This treaty was signed on the 20th of November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1347" id="Page_1347">[1347]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN_BATTLE_OF_ALGIERS" id="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN_BATTLE_OF_ALGIERS"></a>Battle of Algiers. Aug. 27, 1816.</div>

<p>England had one more piece of work to do before laying down her arms.
The attention of the Congress of Vienna had been called to the condition
of the Mediterranean, where commerce was interrupted, and the liberty of
Christians imperilled by the piratical fleets of the slave-holding states
of the Barbary coasts. A general co-operation against the pirates had
been proposed, but no definite resolution was arrived at. To England,
unquestioned mistress of the sea, and herself, by her new position in
the Ionian Isles, a Mediterranean power, fell the duty of suppressing
the evil. Early in 1816, therefore, Lord Exmouth, in command of the
Mediterranean squadron, was instructed to visit the Mahomedan states;
he was to insist upon the release of Ionian slaves, and to negotiate a
peace with the Mahomedans in the interests of Sardinia and Naples. From
Algiers alone could opposition be expected. But the Government there
made no objections to the admiral's demands; the Ionian slaves were
released freely, those of Naples and Sardinia upon the payment of a
ransom. At Tunis, the next port visited, an accident changed the aspect
of affairs. Lord Exmouth, took advantage of a mistake of his interpreter
to declare that it was not the wish only but the fixed determination
of the Prince Regent that slavery should cease altogether. Tripoli and
Tunis submitted, and set free their slaves; but Algiers, a stronger
power, demanded time to refer the matter to Constantinople, promising
to deal directly with the English Government. Meanwhile in Parliament
the principle of ransoming the slaves had been strongly censured, and a
general feeling that force should be used had arisen. A barbarous attack
by Algerine soldiers upon the crews of some coral-ships at Bona allowed
the Government to take advantage of this feeling, by despatching Lord
Exmouth to complete his work. On the 27th of August, having been joined
at Gibraltar by a small Dutch squadron, Lord Exmouth approached Algiers.
After waiting two hours for a reply to his terms he placed his ships
alongside the batteries in positions carefully marked out beforehand.
The work of destruction was complete, the forts were reduced to ruins,
the fleet that lay within the mole was burnt. For nine hours the battle
raged, then when the ammunition was nearly expended the ships withdrew
from their somewhat dangerous position. Their work had been effective: on
the following morning the English terms were accepted, and on the 31st,
1200 slaves were embarked in the fleet, making in all more than 3000 whom
Lord Exmouth had delivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1348" id="Page_1348">[1348]</a></span></p>

<p>The completion of the settlement of Europe had been carried out
during the recess of Parliament. From July 1815 to February 1,
1816, the Government had been able to act entirely unchecked. On
that day Parliament reopened, and Castlereagh resumed his seat in
<span class="sidenote">Opposition in the Parliament. Feb. 1, 1816.</span>
all the triumph of his completed negotiations. But with the conclusion
of the war came the hour of trial for the Tory ministry. The mediocrity
of their talent, the reactionary character of their political views,
had been forgotten, or even regarded as favourable points in their
administration, while they stood forth firmly and energetically to
express and give effect to the great wish of the nation, the destruction
of the Napoleonic rule. With the return of peace the great questions
of home politics were again becoming of importance, and the tendencies
of the party fostered by their successful warfare were to call into
existence an opposition not only in Parliament but among the nation at
large. Already voices were raised against the late negotiations; though,
no doubt, the real magnanimity shown towards France, the advantages
gained for England on the sea, and the security for some years of peace
which the elaborate system of balance was thought to give, were fully
in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the nation. There were
men who, undazzled by the glories of the late war, saw that the policy
of England had in fact favoured absolutism,&mdash;that, for the sake of
the balance of power, countries had been handed over quite irrespective
of the wishes of the people to sovereigns for whom they felt no natural
affection,&mdash;that a dynasty disliked by a large section of the people
had been forced upon France, and was upheld by English bayonets, and
that in spite of the efforts of England the influence of Russia had been
increased. It appeared to them that the intercourse with foreign powers
had rendered our negotiators absolutists. Their conduct with regard to
the Holy Alliance showed <span class="sidenote">The Holy Alliance. Sept.
1815.</span> that this was not in fact the case. The Holy Alliance,
or Convention of September, by which the enthusiastic and sentimental
Emperor of Russia joined with his brother sovereigns of Prussia and
Austria to declare that henceforward their policy should be ruled on
Christian principles alone, had been rejected by the English Government,
which saw danger in this brotherly and religious bond between absolute
monarchs, and declared through the Duke of Wellington that the English
Parliament would require "something more precise." In fact, though in no
way wishing to disturb the English Constitution, the Tory Government had
been led into a course of policy which was not in accordance with English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1349" id="Page_1349">[1349]</a></span>
traditions. The conclusion of a war the burden of which had been upon the
whole patiently borne, should have brought with it the real blessings
of peace; but these were not found in the declaration of the Government
that it intended to keep up the war taxes, and to keep on foot an army
of 150,000, an intention which, when taken in conjunction with the
close alliances entered into with foreign powers, seemed to mean that
England was henceforward to attempt to take its place as one of the great
military powers of the Continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extravagance of the Government.</div>

<p>It was upon the two points of taxation and economy that the Government
first met with opposition. Mr. Vansittart, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
declared his intention of continuing half the income and property tax,
which from the first had been avowedly a war tax. The Opposition to
this measure was headed in the Commons by Brougham. By a skilful use of
parliamentary tactics, he succeeded in gaining time, which he employed
in procuring a flood of petitions exhibiting the feeling of the country
so strongly that the Government was beaten. Apparently in dudgeon at
his defeat, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as he had lost
the income tax he should also throw over the malt tax, a step which
Castlereagh explained by saying that Government was going to contract a
loan, and £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 more or less would make no difference.
The recklessness of this assertion points to one of the evils which the
late war had produced;&mdash;an unbounded and lavish supply of money,
and the habit of spending almost without question if success could
be obtained, had destroyed all idea of economy in the minds of the
ministers. The angry feeling excited in the people by this carelessness
of the public money was not diminished by the extravagances of the Court,
and the constant demands for money to supply the deficiencies of the
Civil List. Although £800,000 was the sum granted in exchange for the
hereditary revenues, the average of late years had been considerably
above a million; in 1815 it had reached nearly a million and a half. On
this point the ministers were themselves obliged to take the initiative,
and a Bill was passed for the better regulation of the Civil List. But
while the demand for economy, for the reduction of the war expenditure,
and the return of England to its usual independent position with regard
to the Continent, afforded themes for the Opposition in Parliament, an
agitation of far more importance had sprung into existence outside its
walls.</p>

<p>At the opening of the session the Prince Regent's speech had congratulated
the country upon the prosperity of agriculture, and of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1350" id="Page_1350">[1350]</a></span>
branches of trade and manufacture. But it was, in fact, a time of
<span class="sidenote">Agricultural depression.</span> unexampled
distress. The principle of protection which had found favour with the
mercantile world in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had been
extended to agriculture. In 1670, a period of great plenty having reduced
the price of corn, it was thought necessary to impose heavy dues on its
importation. Up to 53s. 4d. a duty of 16s. a quarter was imposed, between
that and 80s., a duty of 8s. a quarter. The price at which importation,
free or at a nominal duty, was allowed had been more than once changed.
In 1804 it had been set at 66s. During the latter years of the war there
had been constantly deficient harvests. In 1812 and 1813 the quarter of
wheat had risen to 171s. The average price during six years, from 1808
to 1813, had been 108s. During several of those years the Continental
System had virtually excluded foreign competition. The effect of the high
prices was most disastrous upon agriculture; while the suffering of the
labourer had, as has been explained, been very great, the class of farmer
had changed, the careful small cultivator had given place to ostentatious
spendthrifts. To secure great returns land wholly unfitted for the
purpose had been brought under the plough, crop after crop of corn had
been grown to the exhaustion of the soil, and many advantageous and
necessary forms of agriculture had been thrown aside for the cultivation
of corn. The year 1813 was one of extraordinary plenty, the surplus crop
was enough to continue that plenty during the two following years; the
effect was a very rapid fall in prices. Such a fall naturally entailed
the restoration of a better system of husbandry, and the ruin of many of
those who had embarked on the false course. Peace added still further
to this distress. Violent efforts were made in Parliament by the landed
interest, which was very strong, to bolster up the evil system. It was
proposed in 1813 that importation should be subject to a prohibitory
duty till the price of wheat reached 105s. the quarter. This demand was
reduced to 84s. in 1814. Circumstances prevented its being carried then,
but in 1815, when the foreign markets were again opened, the terror of
approaching cheapness enabled farmers and landlords to combine and hurry
through the House a Corn Law, fixing the price at which corn might be
imported at 80s. In spite of this, however, the distress continued. In
fact, the false inflation of late years was giving way, and agriculture
entering upon a more natural course. The agricultural interests still
complained, and still asserted the necessity of relief, but as, in order
to win their support, the Government had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1351" id="Page_1351">[1351]</a></span>
given up the malt tax, there was really scarcely anything left to give
them, and their complaints remained unanswered; and as the distress,
although it was caused chiefly by the fault of the agriculturalists, and
was but a fair counterpoise to the enormous profits they had lately
been making, was a terrible reality, the poorer classes continued to
suffer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commercial depression.</div>

<p>The depression was not confined to the agricultural interest. The
removal of the restrictions caused by the Continental System excited
lively hopes among the trading community. During the war our exports had
chiefly depended upon an organized contraband trade. Even so, in 1811,
shipments had been made to the Continent to the value of £11,000,000.
It was supposed that, without restrictions, the sum might be doubled.
Everybody wished for a share in the golden harvest, and much money was
transferred from legitimate and lucrative trade to the purchase of
colonial produce for exportation. But what is called effective demand
for any commodity depends not on the desire of the purchaser, but upon
his power of purchase. The exhausting wars of late years so limited
that power of purchase that the exports of England either lay in the
ports unsold or were got rid of at less than the cost price. Nor did our
restrictive commercial policy allow a ready interchange of commodities,
which might have tended to render the disaster less. Peace with America
had produced somewhat the same effects. Thus, both in agriculture and in
commerce, widespread suffering and distress existed.</p>

<p>The difficulties were increased at the time by a considerable reduction
in the circulating medium. The fall in agricultural profits had
ruined many banks in agricultural districts, and induced others to
<span class="sidenote">Riots and political meetings.</span> restrict
their issue of paper money. A severe winter, a deficient harvest, and the
rise of the price of wheat before the close of the year (1815) again to
103s., came to complete the general misery. The effect was a widespread
series of riots; rick-burning and machine-breaking were constant,
especially in the east of England. At Littleport, in the isle of Ely, the
town was for two days in the hands of the mob (May 22), and the tumult
was only suppressed after the military had been called out. In the coal
and iron districts, though the people on the whole behaved well, great
meetings of unemployed operatives took place; while in Nottingham and the
neighbourhood the Luddite disturbances broke out with fresh vehemence.
The discontent and unhappiness of the people before long assumed the
shape of a political movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1352" id="Page_1352">[1352]</a></span>
The change must be attributed to the writings of Cobbett more than
to any other single cause. For some years he had published a
Liberal periodical called "The Weekly Political Register," in which,
with remarkable clearness of style and simple power of argument, he
had constantly attacked the Government. In 1816, he changed the
price of his paper from a shilling to twopence, and it at once became
the oracle of the working classes. His view was, that all the evils of
the time might be cured by reform of Parliament. He indeed went
far beyond what the nation was then fit for, demanding universal
suffrage and annual Parliaments. But his work was the beginning
of the great agitation which continued till the passing of the Reform
Bill of 1832.</p>

<p>Against this new sort of opposition without the walls of Parliament
the Government set to work with violent measures of repression.
The Hampden Clubs, which had sprung up in all directions for
purposes of parliamentary reform, no doubt had fallen in many cases
into the hands of dangerous demagogues. In London they appear to
have become connected with a body of men known as Spencean
philanthropists, after Spence, who, at the beginning of the century,
had made himself notorious by his socialistic plans. To this society
belonged Thistlewood, the two Watsons, and a man of the name of
<span class="sidenote">Meeting in Spa Fields. Dec. 2, 1816.</span>
Preston. Castle, a spy of the police, crept in among them, and probably
urged them to more reckless action than they would otherwise have taken.
According to his account, a great plot was on foot for taking the Tower,
seizing the Government, and establishing a Committee of Public Safety.
A meeting in Spa Fields in connection with this plot was held upon the
2nd of December. It was to be addressed by Mr. Hunt, a vain and empty
demagogue, but before he arrived the Spenceans had begun to act upon
their own authority. Young Watson had led a number of men to Snow Hill
to ransack a gunsmith's shop, and had there shot a gentleman who had
remonstrated with him. The crowd then marched to the Royal Exchange,
where they were met by the Lord Mayor, who courageously withstanding
them, with only seven assistants, easily dispersed them. Preston appears
also singlehanded to have climbed the wall of the Tower, and have
summoned the guard to surrender. Beyond this nothing formidable was
done.</p>

<p>While hunger and misery, the depression of trade, and the
influence of a few able demagogues, were driving the poorer classes
to acts of violence, and a dangerous union was being established
between social and political discontent, the middle classes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1353" id="Page_1353">[1353]</a></span>
gradually arriving at the same conclusion as their inferiors with
<span class="sidenote">Petition from the Corporation of London.</span>
regard to the necessity of a thorough change in the constitution of
Parliament. In December, only a few weeks after the uproar in Spa Fields,
the Corporation of London, of late the firm supporters of the policy
of Government, addressed a petition to the Prince Regent, which throws
a striking light upon the feelings which the conduct of Government
since the war had excited. After a rapid summary "of the distress and
misery, no longer limited to one portion of the Empire, and under
the irresistible pressure of which the commercial, agricultural, and
manufacturing interests are equally sinking," the address goes on to say:
"Our grievances are the natural effect of rash and ruinous wars, unjustly
commenced and pertinaciously persisted in, where no rational object was
to be attained; of immense subsidies to foreign powers to defend their
own territories or to commit aggressions on those of our neighbours;
of a delusive paper currency; of an unconstitutional and unprecedented
military force in time of peace; of the unexampled and increasing
magnitude of the Civil List; of the enormous sums paid for unmerited
pensions and sinecures; and of a long course of the most lavish and
improvident expenditure of the public money throughout every branch of
the Government, all arising from the corrupt and inadequate state of the
representation of the people in Parliament, whereby all constitutional
control over the servants of the Crown has been lost, and Parliaments
have become subservient to the will of Ministers."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incapacity of the Tory party.</div>

<p>It began to be evident that, as the great common interest of the war
disappeared, and the popularity and influence derived from its successful
termination wore itself out, the Tory party, with its repressive and
reactionary doctrines, would find itself wholly unable to handle with
success the domestic questions which inevitably arose. For some years
longer it successfully held its position. Circumstances enabled it again
to separate the middle and lower classes, and full time was allowed it to
exhibit its repressive principles of home government.</p>

<p>The success of the Government was due to the excesses of the mob,
and to the exaggerated fear which it was found possible to excite
among the propertied classes. The Regent had scarcely opened
Parliament, with an assurance that he was well convinced of the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SEVENTEEN_ATTACK_ON_THE_REGENT" id="EIGHTEEN_SEVENTEEN_ATTACK_ON_THE_REGENT"></a>Attack on the Regent. June 28, 1817.</span>
loyalty of the great body of his Majesty's subjects, but
was determined to omit no precautions for preserving
public peace, when, as he was returning from the House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1354" id="Page_1354">[1354]</a></span>
he was ill-received by the people, and a missile thrown from the
crowd even broke one of the windows of his carriage. This outrage
encouraged the Government to take vigorous measures. It was not
difficult to represent the whole project of reform as being indissolubly
<span class="sidenote">Repressive measures of the Government.
March.</span> mixed with the extreme doctrines of Cobbett and the
Spenceans. A secret committee of both Houses was appointed to inquire
into the public disaffection; that of the Lords reported the existence
of a great network of societies and clubs, which, under pretence of
parliamentary reform, were attempting to infect the minds of all classes
with a spirit of disaffection, and contempt of law, religion, and
morality, while no endeavours were omitted to prepare the people to take
up arms on the first signal of the accomplishment of their design. The
Commons committee declared (Feb. 19) that the Hampden Clubs aimed at
nothing short of revolution. Armed with these reports, which were no
doubt extraordinarily exaggerated, Government introduced and carried
Bills for preventing attempts to seduce soldiers and sailors from their
allegiance, to give to the Prince Regent all the safeguards of an actual
sovereign, to prevent seditious meetings, and lastly (March 3), for the
suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act till the 1st of the ensuing July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret political meetings.</div>

<p>The effect of these Acts was at once to give a certain reality to the
dangers on the false apprehension of which they had been based. Public
meetings being impossible, secret meetings, with all the dangers which
invariably attend them, sprang into existence. The worse affected and
more dangerous leaders of the people began to acquire influence, and
desperate designs, fomented and betrayed by spies in the employment
of Government, began to be entertained. It is impossible to suspect
benevolent gentlemen such as Lord Sidmouth of wilfully entrapping
ignorant artisans to their own destruction; but it is certain that use
was constantly made of spies who found it to their own advantage to
concoct and betray treasonable and atrocious conspiracies. The most
notorious of these spies was a man of the name of Oliver, who, giving
himself out as a delegate of London reforming societies, succeeded in
giving a new impulse to the plots in various parts of the manufacturing
districts of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire. The violent
suppression by the military and constables of a peaceable meeting, known
as the meeting of blanketeers, at Manchester on the 29th of March, made
the people more ready to listen to his suggestions. The meeting was a
peaceful one, and acquired its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1355" id="Page_1355">[1355]</a></span>
name from the blankets or coats which many of those assembled had
strapped upon their backs. A few of them set out upon a foolish
march, intending to petition the Prince Regent in person; but their
intentions appear to have been quite peaceful, and though many
were apprehended, they were all discharged before trial. It seems
probable that what is known as the Derby insurrection was one of
the consequences of Oliver's representations. A man of the name of
Brandreth, known as "the Captain," went from house to house near
Pentridge, spreading such assertions as that England, Ireland, and
<span class="sidenote">The Derby insurrection. June 10.</span> France
were all to rise that night at ten o'clock, and that the "northern
clouds," or men from the north, would come down and sweep all before
them. A few men collected in arms at his summons. They do not seem ever
to have numbered much more than an hundred, and were without difficulty
dispersed, and many of them taken prisoners by the military at a short
distance from Nottingham. Such disturbances as these were held to justify
a second suspension of the Habeas Corpus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suppression of seditious writings.</div>

<p>But it was not only against seditious actions that Lord Sidmouth
determined to proceed, but against seditious writings also. On the 27th
of March he wrote a circular to the Lords Lieutenant of counties, in
which he declared that in the opinion of the law officer the justices of
the peace might issue a warrant to apprehend any person charged before
them on oath with the publication of blasphemous or seditious libels, and
compel him to give bail to answer to the charge. Considering the jealousy
with which any political interference with the liberty of the press was
regarded, and that by Fox's Libel Bill even the judges were held unfit to
decide on the character of a libel, which was to be left to the decision
of the jury, it is difficult to conceive a more high-handed interference
with what was generally regarded as a constitutional privilege.
Considerable use was made of the instructions, yet on the whole with so
little success that the Government procured but a single conviction.
The most important of these trials was that of
<span class="sidenote">Mr. Hone's trial. Dec. 18, 1817.</span> Mr. Hone,
which must have showed the Government, if nothing else could, how odious
and useless their attempts to stifle the free expression of opinion was.
Hone was a quiet and inoffensive publisher, a great collector and reader
of old books. He had published certain political parodies, of which
the subject can be pretty well understood from the titles they bore,
"The Sinecurist's Creed," "The Litany, or General Supplication." It was
against their alleged blasphemous character that proceedings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1356" id="Page_1356">[1356]</a></span>
taken. Each parody was the subject of a separate trial, and the whole
proceedings occupied three days. On the first day Mr. Justice Abbott, on
the second and third Lord Chief-Justice Ellenborough occupied the bench.
Hone defended himself, basing his argument on the essential difference
between parodies intended to throw scorn upon the work parodied and
those in which well-known writings were travestied for the purpose of
ridiculing some other subject, and supporting himself by innumerable
instances of political parodies couched in biblical forms coming from
the pens of well-known and respected writers. His erudition enabled
him to continue for many hours on each day producing instances of this
kind. With astonishing firmness he refused to be browbeaten by Lord
Ellenborough, and upon the third day even attacked his judge for the
partisan spirit in which he had charged the jury the preceding evening.
In all three trials, after a brief consideration, the jury acquitted
him. The persistency with which the charges against Hone were pressed
after his first acquittal entirely discredited the grounds of public
morality on which the Government was professedly acting, and had all the
appearance of a vindictive desire for revenge on the part of men smarting
under deserved political satire.</p>

<p>The system pursued by the Tories, though for the time it was
successful in keeping up a general dread of popular violence, and thus
temporarily hushed the agitation for reform, was gradually alienating
from Government all classes but the one immediately connected with
it, and forcing the nation at large to look upon Government itself
as its natural enemy, and to fix its hopes more and more upon some
constitutional change. Indeed, though its large majority in the House
enabled the Government to reject all liberal measures, and to pass those
which it itself produced, a powerful Opposition began to show itself
within the walls of the House, which the conduct of the Administration
did not tend to conciliate. The extension of the
<span class="sidenote">The Alien Act. May 5, 1818.</span> Alien Act, which
reserved to the Government the power of removing aliens who were objects
of suspicion, and which had already been twice renewed since the peace,
for a further period of two years, was regarded as an attack upon the
English right of asylum in favour of the Continental despotisms. It was
warmly opposed, and a flaw found in it which secured its rejection. By
the Act of Union, shareholders in the Bank of Scotland became naturalized
subjects. An alien, by taking shares in the Bank, could therefore evade
that Act. A clause was introduced to check this means of evading the Act;
but as naturalized subjects had certain exemptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1357" id="Page_1357">[1357]</a></span>
with regard to the payment of duties, the Lower House held that the
introduction of the clause was an infringement of their privilege, as
being in fact the introduction of a money clause. It had therefore to be
<span class="sidenote">The Indemnity Bill. March 13.</span> dropped and
a new Bill introduced. Even an attempt on the part of Government to
gain popularity turned to its discredit. A show was made of destroying
numerous sinecures; but as this destruction was coupled with a Pension
List of an amount almost equal to that of the sinecures destroyed, the
trick excited more anger than gratitude among the public. But the great
contest of the time was on the subject of the indemnity demanded by the
ministry to cover acts done during the suspension of the Habeas Corpus
Act. A sealed bag of papers was laid upon the table of the House, which
the Government demanded should be referred to a committee of secresy.
The committee was to be appointed by ballot, but lists were circulated
among the ministerial majority of the members for whom they should
vote; in fact, therefore, the committee was nominated by the Government
itself. The report declared that the suspension was necessary, and that
the Government had used the powers given them well. But the demand for
an indemnity, while the grounds for that indemnity were kept studiously
secret and examined only by the Government nominees, for the avowed
purpose of keeping from the public the names of the witnesses who had
given secret information, increased still further the bad impression
which the employment of men like Oliver had already created.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_EIGHTEEN_CONDITION_OF_THE_ROYAL_FAMILY" id="EIGHTEEN_EIGHTEEN_CONDITION_OF_THE_ROYAL_FAMILY"></a>Condition of the royal family.</div>

<p>Under other circumstances loyalty for the Crown might have served to
lessen the growing division between the Government and the people; the
state of the royal family, and the character of most of its members, was
now such as to weaken all such feeling. For the old King and Queen there
was doubtless respect and pitying affection; but it was known that both
the afflicted monarch himself and his faithful wife and guardian might at
any moment die. As it was, they lived retired from the public view. The
Prince Regent, the ostensible sovereign of the country, was understood to
be little more than a selfish voluptuary. His reception on the opening
of Parliament of 1817 shows how much he had lost the affections of the
people. His unhappy domestic relations, shortly to become the ground of
a keen party struggle, not only afforded a perpetual subject of scandal,
but seemed to forbid the possibility of a direct male heir to the throne.
The people's hopes were centred on the Princess Charlotte, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1358" id="Page_1358">[1358]</a></span>
Regent's only daughter, but lately married to Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg, and the blow was felt to be heavy when she died in 1817,
immediately after giving birth to a child which did not live. It seemed
for the instant highly probable that the large and strong family of the
old King would come to an end in the first generation. Before the close
of the following year this probability was lessened. No less than four
members of the royal family were then married&mdash;Princess Elizabeth,
the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Cambridge, and the Duke of Kent,
who married respectively the Landgrave of Hesse Homburg, the Princess
Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the Princess Augusta of Hesse, and Princess
Victoria of Saxe-Coburg Saalfield, the widow of the Prince of Leiningen
and sister of Prince Leopold. Had the family been at all popular such
events, under the circumstances, would certainly have afforded joy
to the nation. As it was, they only afforded an opportunity for the
expression of a deeply fixed belief in the extravagance and wastefulness
of the royal family. Of all the marriages that of the Duke of Kent with
a sister of Prince Leopold was alone well received. The demand for an
increase of income on behalf of the other princes was strongly resisted
in Parliament; the sum proposed for the Duke of Clarence was reduced
by nearly half, and a grant of £6000 for the Duke of Cumberland, who
had been married three years previously, was absolutely rejected by a
majority of six members, a result which was received with loud cheers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ministers' insecurity with the present
Parliament.</div>

<p>The insecurity felt by Government, in spite of its large majority,
in the present Parliament betrayed it into conduct which still further
increased its unpopularity. The Parliament was now in its sixth
session, and therefore approaching its time of dissolution. But several
circumstances might call it again into existence. A clause in the
Regency Act provided that Parliament should be summoned on the death
of the Queen. The ministry had lately got the clause repealed; but
the death either of the King or Regent, if happening before the day
appointed for the assembling of the new Parliament, would have caused the
reassembling of the old. Both King and Queen might die at any moment;
nor was the Regent's health good. The dissolution was therefore hurried
on in a manner which caused much anger. On the 10th of June Parliament
was prorogued and dissolved at the same time, a form of proceeding
unprecedented since the days of Charles II. The temper of the country
was not improved by this step, and the elections were attended with the
bitterest party strife. In Westminster Sir George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1359" id="Page_1359">[1359]</a></span>
Murray, who stood on the Tory interest to replace if possible Lord
Cochrane, who had withdrawn to take command of the navies of Chili, was
so ill-used that his life was thought to be in danger. Several Radical
candidates offered themselves, among others Hunt the orator; but the more
respectable inhabitants contrived to save themselves from the disgrace of
such representatives by bringing in Romilly, without any expense of his
own, at the head of the poll. The other member was Sir Francis Burdett.
In the same way the City of London elected four Liberals, rejecting three
old ministerial representatives. This clearly showed the rising temper
of the middle classes. But as the representation was then arranged no
great change was possible, and the ministers found themselves still in
possession of a large majority (July).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evacuation of France by the allies. Nov. 30,
1818.</div>

<p>Before the assembling of the new Parliament (Jan. 14, 1819) one
piece of foreign history deserves notice. A congress was held at
Aix-la-Chapelle (Oct. 2, 1818), at which the final evacuation of France
by the allies, although only three of the five years stipulated were
accomplished, was agreed upon. This wise and just act seems to have been
chiefly due to the Duke of Wellington, in opposition to some of the
extreme Tories of the Cabinet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_NINETEEN_RESUMPTION_OF_CASH_PAYMENTS" id="EIGHTEEN_NINETEEN_RESUMPTION_OF_CASH_PAYMENTS"></a>Resumption of cash payments. May 1819.</div>

<p>In spite of their parliamentary majority, the ministry did not feel
very secure upon their seats, and it was perhaps more with a view of
re-establishing their credit with the country than from increased wisdom
that the Cabinet so far changed its views with regard to the currency
question as to accept the truth of the doctrines which Francis Horner
had some years (1811) before laid down, and introduced a measure in
accordance with the plans of Ricardo, the political economist, for the
resumption of cash payments. The Bank had already issued a considerable
quantity of gold. Since 1817 as much as £6,000,000 had been put into
circulation, but as the paper money still continued, as a matter of
course this partial action produced no good effect; the gold had found
its way out of the country, chiefly to France. It was now ordered that
this voluntary payment in gold should cease. An examination of the
affairs of the Bank proved that it was in excellent condition, and a
series of resolutions were passed and subsequently embodied in Bills by
Mr. Peel. By these, from the 1st of February 1820, the Bank was obliged
to exchange its notes for gold ingots, in not less quantity than sixty
ounces, at the rate of 81s. the ounce; in October of the same year the
rate was to be reduced to 79s. 6d. the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1360" id="Page_1360">[1360]</a></span>
ounce; on the 1st of May 1822 the rate was reduced to the regular mint
price of £3, 17s. 10½d.; and in May 1823 all notes were to be paid on
demand in legal coin. As a fact, on the 1st of May 1821 the Bank resumed
complete payment in cash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign Enlistment Bill.</div>

<p>Several divisions in Parliament clearly showed the growing weakness
of Government. The Foreign Enlistment Bill, to
prevent English subjects from serving in a foreign service
or fitting out ships of war for foreign countries, was
carried by a majority of thirteen only, the ground of opposition
being that the Bill was in fact directed to the injury of the revolted
colonies of Spain in America, in whose ranks many Englishmen
were serving. Like the Alien Act of the preceding session, the
Bill was considered as a proof of that legitimist and absolute tendency
of which the Government was accused. Again, in the great
<span class="sidenote">Catholic emancipation rejected. May 3.</span>
question of Catholic emancipation, which was brought
forward by Grattan in the best speech he ever made in
the House, the Government were victorious by a majority
of two only in a very full House; while it was actually defeated by
<span class="sidenote">Reform of Scotch burghs. May 6.</span> a majority
of five on the question of the reform of Scotch burghs, which it had
got rid of in the last session. The system in those burghs had been in
existence ever since the fifteenth century, and so acted as to perpetuate
the administration in the hands of one party, often of one family only,
as the retiring members of the corporation had the right of electing
their own successors. For years the burghs had been bent upon ridding
themselves of this exclusive government; as in the case of other reforms,
their efforts had passed out of sight during the tumult of the French
wars, again to be called into existence on the resumption of peace. In
1817 certain irregularities of form in the burgh of Montrose had caused
the elections to be set aside by the law courts. The Crown had been
compelled to give a new charter, in which a certain popular element was
admitted. Other burghs at once began to clamour for similar changes.
To their petitions, however, the Government turned a deaf ear. When
the elections in Aberdeen were quashed by the law courts, as those at
Montrose had been, the old constitution had been re-established, and
Lord Archibald Hamilton now took up the cause of the burghs. He demanded
a copy of the new warrant, and was defeated by five only. Pressing his
success, he demanded that the petitions of the burghs should be referred
to a select committee. A large majority of the burghs themselves were
loudly calling for reform. The population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1361" id="Page_1361">[1361]</a></span>
of those who desired it amounted to 420,000, as opposed to 60,000, the
population of those who had not petitioned. The proof of the wish of
the people most interested was too strong for the House; in spite of
the Government opposition, Lord Archibald's motion was carried in a
House of nearly 300 by a majority of five. As the ground of opposition
had been avowedly that a change in the burghs was but the beginning of
parliamentary reform, this victory shows how the opposition to that
measure was gradually breaking down.</p>

<p>In spite of these signs of weakness, the ministers were upon the
whole well satisfied with the session. They believed in the success
of their repressive measures in the year 1817, and thought that the
state of the country was both quieter and more prosperous than it
<span class="sidenote">Chronic sufferings of the poor.</span> had been.
Complaints of the depression of agriculture, and poverty and suffering
among the agricultural poor, were indeed chronic; they depended upon
causes over which the immediate action of Government had little control.
Exaggerated rents were seeking their natural level; over-cultivation,
especially of corn, was giving place to more rational agriculture, and
the enormous prosperity enjoyed by the agriculturists during the war was
shrinking to modest and hard-won profits; the change could not but be
attended with some depression and many painful contrasts. At the same
time the action of the Poor Law as then administered, the injudicious
fostering of the population which had gone on during the war, and the law
of settlement which prevented free competition of labour, of necessity
caused misery among the labourers. It was when the manufacturing and
mercantile interests were also touched, when, under the action of
restrictive corn laws, prices rose, while work was not to be had, that
the social dangers of the country became from time to time great.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the year 1818 had been rather apparent than
real; there had been much over-trading; a more healthy spirit
appears to have arisen in the beginning of 1819, but the effects of
the preceding folly were now to be felt. In the first half of the year
the number of bankruptcies were almost double the average, the
price of corn was still as high as 75s., work was scarce, and wages
fell, and before the year was over the ministry found upon their
hand difficulties even greater than those they had experienced in the
<span class="sidenote">Political meetings.</span> gloomy year of 1817.
For again the political question was ready to start to life, again
leaders of a higher class were ready to take advantage of the sufferings
of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1362" id="Page_1362">[1362]</a></span>
and men of more extreme views among themselves were eager to
lead them into desperate and revolutionary designs. There had
been great meetings near Leeds, Glasgow, and at Ashton-under-Lyne,
in June. On the 28th of that month, Sir Charles Wolseley and the
Rev. Joseph Harrison had made violent speeches at a great assembly
at Stockport, and Sir Charles had been elected the "legislatorial
representative" for Birmingham. At the same time the reformers
were found to be engaged in drilling. No arms were seen, and it is
asserted by one of their leaders that the only object of their drilling
was to secure order and regularity and the better appearance at a
forthcoming great meeting at Manchester. On the other hand, it was
held by those who dreaded popular movements that the drilling had
been long and secretly continued, and was a part of a great plan for
an exhibition of physical force. The object of the Manchester meeting,
which was to be held on the 9th of August, was to choose a
representative as Birmingham had already done. The meeting was
declared illegal; a requisition was therefore sent to the proper
officials, begging them to call it legally. On their refusal, it was
determined to hold it, legal or not, on the 16th, in St. Peter's Field.
Thither, on the day appointed, large bodies of men, well dressed and
without arms, but in something like military array, marched from all
<span class="sidenote">The Manchester Massacre. Aug. 16, 1819.</span>
the neighbouring towns, and collected round a hustings, from which Hunt
was to address them. Their number perhaps amounted to about 80,000, all
pressed together in a space of not more than three acres. The magistrates
had formed no very definite notion of what to do. They had assembled a
considerable military force, of which a troop of Manchester yeomen about
forty strong and six troops of the 15th Hussars formed a part. A warrant
was out against Hunt, and with extreme imprudence it was determined to
execute it while he was on the hustings, as had been done in the case of
Harrison on a previous occasion. Just as Hunt was beginning to speak, a
strange pressure made itself visible to the crowd. The magistrates had
come to a house overlooking the field; they had intrusted their warrant
to the chief constable; he had declared he could not execute it without
military aid, and the yeomen had pressed into the crowded space. As was
natural, they had been separated and brought to a complete standstill.
Upon this the magistrates seem to have lost their presence of mind, to
have believed that the yeomanry were in danger, and to have ordered the
15th Hussars to extricate them. The consequence was a fearful charge,
which swept everything before it, and, as one of the officers says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1363" id="Page_1363">[1363]</a></span>
"by the time they had reached the other side of the field the fugitives
were literally piled up to a considerable elevation above the level of
the ground." The effect of the panic on so closely-packed a multitude,
among whom the soldiers were using the sword, sometimes the flat and
sometimes the edge, was fearful; about thirty wounded persons were
carried to the infirmary, and forty more found their own way there in the
course of the day. The actual wounds given by the soldiers do not appear
to have been very many. Hunt and some of his followers were apprehended;
the charge of high treason against them was subsequently dropped, and
they were obliged to find bail to stand their trial for misdemeanour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Culpability of the Government.</div>

<p>The Manchester Massacre, as it was called, was the result of accident
and the bad management of the magistrates, but the Government seemed
to make the act entirely their own when they lavished approbation on
the conduct of the authorities, and when they induced the Prince Regent
himself to write an approving letter. As usual in England, the employment
of the military except in the very last necessity excited the anger of
very many even of the wealthier classes. Among those who had suffered
from it its effect was simply to exasperate; for the time the temper of
the people seems to have been really dangerous. The point, on the other
hand, which struck the ministerialists was the weakness of the existing
laws for the suppression of sedition, and in accordance with their view
it was thought necessary to hold an autumnal session, which met on the
23rd of November, and which passed by large <span class="sidenote">The
Six Acts.</span> majorities a series of enactments known as "The Six
Acts." These were respectively entitled, "An Act to prevent delay in the
administration of justice in cases of misdemeanour;" "An Act to prevent
the training of persons in the use of arms and the practice of military
evolutions;" "An Act for the prevention and punishment of blasphemous
and seditious libels;" "An Act to authorize justices of the peace, in
certain disturbed counties, to seize and detain arms;" "An Act to subject
certain publications to the duties of stamps upon newspapers, and to make
other regulations for restraining the abuses arising from the publication
of blasphemous and seditious libels;" and "An Act for preventing the
assembling of seditious assemblies." Having passed these repressive
measures, the Parliament was again prorogued (Dec. 29) till February
1820. In the interval, on the 29th of January, the old King died, in his<a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY_DEATH_OF_THE_GEORGE" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY_DEATH_OF_THE_GEORGE"></a>
eighty-second year.</p>

<p><span class="first drop">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was no longer as Regent but as King that George, the new
monarch, met the Parliament on its reassembling. He had so
long acted virtually as sovereign that scarcely any visible effect was

produced by the change. Yet during the first days
there was considerable probability that the change of
reign would be marked by a change of ministry, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1365" id="Page_1365">[1365]</a></span>
there were two questions on which the ministers felt it their duty to
oppose the new King&mdash;the one an increase of his private revenue,
the other the divorce of his unfortunate wife. On the latter point,
unfortunately for themselves, they were induced to make a compromise,
believing that they were acting safely. Extremely anxious to avoid a
public scandal, they refused at first to move in the matter of the
divorce as long as the Queen remained quietly abroad, but promised to
gratify the King's wishes should she make her appearance in England. On
these terms they remained in office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cato Street conspiracy. Feb. 23, 1820.</div>

<p>But, at the very time that their position as ministers was in danger,
their lives were threatened by a conspiracy which in its atrocity
and feebleness gives a fair measure of the power and intentions of
the worst part of those engaged in the agitations of the day. As in
the case of the Derby insurrection, it is impossible to acquit the
authorities of the guilt of having employed spies who, though probably
without Government authority, did in fact aggravate the crime of the
conspirators. Information was given as early as November by a man named
Edwards of a plot against the lives of the ministers, and from that time
till the day of the explosion of the Cato Street conspiracy he continued
to play the double part of conspirator and police agent. The form the
plot ultimately assumed was the murder of all the ministers in a body
at a Cabinet dinner, which Edwards informed the conspirators was to
be held at Lord Harrowby's on the 23rd of February. The assassination
was to be followed up by an attempt to fire the barracks, and to rouse
the people to an assault upon the Bank and the Tower. As the ministry
were well informed of the plot, the dinner was of course postponed. The
guests arriving at the house of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was
giving a dinner-party that day, and who lived next door to Lord Harrowby,
prevented the conspirators from discovering the postponement of the
ministerial meeting; and they were arming themselves in a stable in Cato
Street, near Edgeware Road, when the police came upon them. The capture
was badly managed; the first officer who entered the room was stabbed,
and in the confusion Thistlewood (already mentioned as the confederate of
the Watsons), who was the soul of the present conspiracy, with fourteen
others, contrived to escape; the rest, nine in number, were apprehended
when the soldiers, who should have accompanied the police, arrived. Early
the next morning, however, Thistlewood was captured. He and four others
were executed, and five more transported for life. The terror excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1366" id="Page_1366">[1366]</a></span>
throughout England was strangely exaggerated; the design appears to have
been confined entirely to a few desperate men, and to have been scouted
by all the more earnest Radicals to whom it had been suggested. About
the same time the other prisoners, Hunt and his friends from Manchester
(April), Wolseley and Harrison from Stockport (July), were tried, and
sentenced to various periods of imprisonment. One advantage at least came
from the trials; the true character of Hunt was discovered, his friends
and companions learnt the worthlessness and egregious vanity of the man,
and his influence was entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>The Parliament had assembled, according to law, upon the demise of
the King, and after going through the necessary business, was dissolved.
In April the new Parliament met. But any interest which
<span class="sidenote">Importance of the Queen's trial.</span> might
otherwise have attended its labours disappeared before the absorbing
interest of the year, the trial of the Queen. Though in itself wholly
unconnected with politics, no event produced a stronger influence on the
course of political growth. The loyalty of the country, and respect for
authority and for the established powers, received a rude shock. It could
not be otherwise when the people saw a ministry, many of whose severest
and most unpopular measures had been based on the specious ground of
the desire to maintain morality, forcing into public notice scandalous
details, which the papers spread to every corner of the country for the
satisfaction of prurient curiosity; when they saw the sovereign having
recourse to all the foul and mean resources of the private inquiry
office, which fill right-minded men with disgust even in the cases of
private individuals, and the Government lending the whole weight of its
authority to the vindictive prosecution of an unfortunate and ill-used
woman. The effect was a complete severance between the Government and
the more liberal-minded of the middle classes, whom fear of popular
extravagances had hitherto united with it, and from the close of this
trial may be dated the serious determination of the people at large to
insist upon some great measure of reform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of the Queen.</div>

<p>Whatever may have been her folly or her guilt, no one can question
the misfortune of the Queen. Giddy by nature and
badly educated, she had been forced (1795) against her
will upon a man whose immoral and selfish character wholly unfitted
him for the difficult position of a husband of a frivolous and unwise
wife. His distaste had been exhibited at their very first meeting,
and he could only force himself to assume a gracious demeanour by
having recourse to wine or spirits. From the very first he seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1367" id="Page_1367">[1367]</a></span>
have designed to part from her; she was early sent into a sort of
banishment at Blackheath, a watch was set upon her conduct, an
investigation before the Lords was set on foot, and though declared
innocent of any grave offence, disgusted at such treatment, she
unwisely withdrew abroad in 1814. She was followed in her retirement,
by the advice of Sir John Leach, by emissaries to collect evidence
against her, unknown to herself. It would have been wise
had she remained abroad, but the treatment she had received rendered
her desperate; she had been excluded from foreign courts, and when
her husband came to the throne her name was omitted from the
Liturgy. It seems to have been this last insult which roused her to
action. In June she came to England, and was received with enthusiasm
by the people, who regarded her as a persecuted woman. She
thus placed the ministers in the awkward position of being obliged
to fulfil the compromise under which they had retained office and
to proceed to extremities against her. On the 6th of June the King
sent a message to the Lords, ordering them to institute an inquiry
into the Queen's conduct, and proofs were laid on the table. On the
following day, Mr. Brougham, who undertook the management of
her case as her Attorney-General, read a letter to the Commons demanding
a public inquiry. Some efforts were made to effect a compromise,
but as the King refused to demand her reception abroad or
to insert her name in the Liturgy, all negotiations failed. The secret
committee of the Lords therefore proceeded to make its report, declaring
<span class="sidenote">Trial of the Queen. Aug. 17.</span> that a solemn
inquiry was necessary; and Lord Liverpool shocked public feeling by
introducing, for the purpose of producing such an inquiry, a Bill of
pains and penalties to deprive her Majesty of her position as Queen,
and to dissolve the King's marriage. The trial in fact came on with the
second reading of the Bill, when the charges against the Queen were
stated before the Lords; and for nearly a month the House was occupied
in hearing witness. By this time the feeling in England was strongly
excited. The ministers were insulted whenever they appeared abroad, and
every opportunity was taken by the crowd of showing their sympathy with
the Queen. The question had become in fact a political one, and the Queen
lent herself only too readily to a somewhat ostentatious display of her
sufferings. In October the defence commenced, and at length, on the 6th
of November, the second reading of the Bill was passed by a majority
of twenty-eight. Two days afterwards, on the third reading, there was
a majority of only nine. As this was in the House of Lords, where the
ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1368" id="Page_1368">[1368]</a></span>
were strongest, they saw it was useless to persevere, and Lord Liverpool
declared that the Bill was abandoned. A burst of joy was heard throughout
the country, for three nights London was illuminated, even Prince Leopold
joining in the rejoicings. Declining all offers from the Government,
the Queen placed her cause in the hands of the Commons. An annuity of
£50,000 was given her the following session. But she was determined upon
some more public announcement of her innocence; she still tried, though
in vain, to secure the introduction of her name in the Liturgy, and was
foolish enough on the occasion of the coronation in July of the following
year to attempt to force her way into the Abbey. She had already begun to
lose the sympathy of the people when, in August, she died.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYONE_CONSEQUENT_ALIENATION_BETWEEN_MINISTRY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYONE_CONSEQUENT_ALIENATION_BETWEEN_MINISTRY"></a>Consequent alienation between the ministry and
people.</div>

<p>However right it may have been to raise the question of the Queen's
guilt, there was a general feeling that the ministers had at all events
mismanaged the question, and after exciting strongly the temper of the
people, had dropped their Bill without excuse or apology. Advantage
was taken of the popular anger, excited by what was thought an act
of oppression, to give currency to all sorts of charges against the
ministry, and to impute to them unconstitutional principles, and
connivance or even approbation of scandalous conspiracies against the
Queen's character, of which they were certainly guiltless. But, before
all, the late events had given a popular rallying-point for all sections
of the Opposition, and had demonstrated how deep was the alienation
between the ministry and the body of the people. It is from this time
that we find serious and sometimes successful efforts made to begin the
work of reform, which it was believed would render such an alienation
impossible. Although, as was to be expected in a House elected under
the old system, any wide measure, such as that produced by Lambton
(subsequently Lord Durham, April 1821), recommending equal electoral
districts, was sure to be defeated by a large majority, Lord John Russell
succeeded in procuring the disfranchisement of Grampound, a notoriously
corrupt borough in Cornwall (May 30). He and his friends were wise enough
to accept this small beginning, even though his Bill was changed in the
Upper House, where the vacant seat was transferred, not to one of the
great unrepresented cities, as would have been just, but to the county
of York. In the same way the great question of Catholic disabilities was
brought forward with renewed strength. Those who were in favour of their
removal were successful in the Lower House, and the Bill was only lost
after passing through most of its stages in the Lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1369" id="Page_1369">[1369]</a></span></p>

<p>So shaken indeed was the predominance of the extreme Tory
party, that in the year 1821 they found it necessary to strengthen
themselves by a coalition with the Conservative section of the
Opposition, hoping by this means to give a more broad and liberal
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTWO_PEEL_AND_WELLESLEY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTWO_PEEL_AND_WELLESLEY"></a>Peel joins the ministry.</span> appearance
to the administration. Lord Grenville himself declined office, but
several of his followers were admitted to the ministry, while a still
further improvement was made by the retirement of Lord Sidmouth, who
had played so prominent a part in all the late repressive measures, and
the substitution in his place of Mr. Peel, as yet Tory in his views,
but capable, as was subsequently proved, of constant advance, and of
an intellect so clear and sensible as to be able to learn, as his
predecessor never could, the growing requirements of the time. At the
same time Lord Wellesley was sent as Lord-Lieutenant to Ireland, with
Mr. Plunkett as his Attorney-General, both of them supporters of the
Catholic claims; and although Wellesley's statesmanlike character and
moderation excited the anger of extreme men on both sides, the mere fact
of such a man being placed at the head of the Irish Government was a
clear mark of the relaxation of the principles of the Tory system. These
new appointments were but the beginning, to be followed in a few months
by other changes far more important, which were to effect an entire
alteration in the position which England occupied in Europe, and in
the principles which governed her financial policy. These changes were
the admission, in 1822 and 1823, of Mr. Canning and Mr. Huskisson to
the ministry. Throughout the trial of Queen Caroline, Canning had held
himself studiously aloof. He had been early one of the Queen's advisers,
had declared from the first his intention to avoid any participation
in her trial, and had in fact remained abroad during its continuance.
On his return in December, thinking it impossible for a minister to be
entirely absent from his duties, but determined to take no part in the
discussions on the trial which were inevitable, he insisted on resigning
his place at the Board of Trade. He was therefore at first excluded
from the new ministerial arrangements. The India Company indeed had
decided upon sending him as Governor-General to India. His preparations
<span class="sidenote">Death of Castlereagh. Canning Secretary of
State. Sept. 11, 1822.</span> for taking the post were being made, and
he was at Liverpool on a farewell visit to his constituents, when a
piece of news was heard which caused a profound movement both at home
and abroad,&mdash;Lord Castlereagh, now become Lord Londonderry, had
committed suicide. The man who was regarded as the real soul of the Tory
party, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1370" id="Page_1370">[1370]</a></span>
the type of the arbitrary and absolutist temper which distinguished it,
had passed away. Honourable and amiable in his private life, he had
contrived to render himself so unpopular that the news of his death was
received with unseemly rejoicings, and his coffin was followed to the
Abbey with shouts of gladness from his enemies. Europe was in a critical
condition. Lord Londonderry had been in the act of going to an European
Congress held at Verona. Canning appeared to be the only man fitted to
supply his place. When asked to join the ministry as Secretary of State
for foreign affairs, after some consideration, he threw up the great post
for which he was at the moment destined, and accepted the office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN_POSITION_OF_ENGLAND_ABROAD" id="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN_POSITION_OF_ENGLAND_ABROAD"></a>Retrospect of the affairs of Europe.</div>

<p>To understand the importance of this change it is necessary to say
a few words on what had passed in Europe since the Peace. The hopes of
the liberal party in Europe had received a heavy blow at the Congress of
Vienna. England had so constantly put herself forward as the champion of
<span class="sidenote">Position of England abroad.</span> freedom, and
her influence had been so preponderating in the late events of the war,
that she was expected to have taken up strong ground in the settlement
of Europe, and to have demanded and secured some sort of popular rights
in the countries to which her assistance had been given. The nation had
shown itself so full of resources, and had been so exceptional in the
success of its opposition to Napoleon, that a general belief had arisen
that there was something peculiarly excellent in the character of its
constitution. So strong was this feeling, that many of the sovereigns
of Europe promised constitutions to their people. It was forgotten that
the freedom for which England had been fighting meant deliverance from
external conquest, and had no connection with the internal freedom of
national constitutions, that, on the contrary, the war against France
had been originally undertaken, if not ostensibly yet really, to oppose
the revolutionary temper of France. It was a severe disappointment when
the English minister was seen joining with Talleyrand in upholding
legitimacy, and for the sake of that principle, and to preserve
in its old lines the balance of European power, himself demanding
the destruction of the liberty of Belgium and of Genoa, and calmly
acquiescing in the absorption of much of Saxony, the final division of
Poland, and the destruction of Norway. Even the one constitutional effort
which was made, the establishment of a limited monarchy in France, was
rendered nugatory by the fact, that the privileges were given as a grant
and charter from the crown, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1371" id="Page_1371">[1371]</a></span>
first principle of the English Constitution&mdash;that power is from the
people&mdash;ignored.</p>

<p>But though in the general triumph of the moment his foreign
policy was accepted and even approved, it will be remembered that
even Castlereagh felt himself compelled to respect public opinion at
home and to hold aloof from the Holy Alliance, which seemed to
assert the unity of interests of the crowned heads and their sole right,
<span class="sidenote">Effect of Castlereagh's policy.</span> as of
divine origin, to be the governors of the world. It was the extension
of the principles of the Holy Alliance which had produced the present
critical state of Europe, with which his moderate abilities, his natural
tendency towards repressive government, aggravated by domestic affairs,
and the entanglements in which his policy at the Vienna Treaty had
involved him, rendered Castlereagh unable to cope. It was no use to
ignore the fact that the French Revolution had given a great impulse to
the ideas of constitutional freedom. Even the conquests of Napoleon,
followed as they always were by democratic changes, had fostered these
ideas in the very countries which had suffered most from them; and
when it appeared that all hopes and promises of freedom were entirely
illusory, insurrections of the deceived people burst out in several
parts of Europe, and where the strength of the government rendered such
outbreaks impossible, secret societies, more dangerous and extravagant
because they were secret, sprang everywhere into existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY_INSURRECTIONS_IN_SPAIN" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY_INSURRECTIONS_IN_SPAIN"></a>Insurrection in Spain. 1820.</div>

<p>The first outbreak was in Spain, where Ferdinand had entirely refused
the constitution to which he was pledged, and had shown his character by
directing his vengeance chiefly against those very men who had been most
prominent in saving his kingdom from the French. During the occupation
of Spain by the French, when the central authority of the mother country
was virtually destroyed, the South American colonies had, one after the
other, thrown off their allegiance, and were still engaged in making good
their independence. It was an army collected at Cadiz for the purpose of
reducing the victorious colonies which set the example of insurrection.
It mutinied in the beginning of the year 1820, and was so successful that
the King was compelled, on the 7th of March, to accept the constitution
of 1812, which had been drawn up under the influence of Napoleonic and
American ideas. In August the constitutional spirit passed to Portugal.
Since the departure of the royal family from Lisbon in 1808, the King had
not returned to his European dominions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1372" id="Page_1372">[1372]</a></span>
Brazil became the seat of government, the restrictions formerly put
<span class="sidenote">Insurrection in Portugal.</span> upon its trade
were removed, it was elevated nominally to the rank of a kingdom,
and Portugal seemed to occupy the position of a colony of its former
dependency. The discontent which had thus been fostered displayed itself
in August, when national Juntas were established both in Oporto and
Lisbon; subsequently, on the 1st of October, the provincial assembly
coalesced with that of the capital, and the regency was compelled to
resign its functions. When at length in the following spring the King set
out for his continental dominions, it was a question whether he would
arrive in time to save them. Almost at the same time similar events
took place in Naples. Ferdinand IV. could not entirely disregard
<span class="sidenote">Insurrection in Naples.</span> popular wishes and rule
despotically, as his nephew in Spain had done, for the longer and more
complete hold which Murat, Napoleon's nominee, had obtained upon the
throne had given time for ideas of constitutional government to become
prevalent, and the army was full of Napoleonic soldiers. But in spite of
the comparative liberality of his government, Ferdinand's army was full
of discontented soldiers, and the secret and revolutionary societies
of the Carbonari undermined society. At the same time, in the island
of Sicily a constitution had been established under the influence of
Lord William Bentinck, and had been swept away on the restoration. In
July the garrison at Nola mutinied, and before a week was over the King
was obliged to accept the Spanish constitution, which had become the
formula of the Liberal party, although there was actually no copy of that
document to be found, and no one in fact knew anything about it. Sicily
soon followed Naples; but recollections of its old independence prevented
it at first from joining the revolutionary government of the mainland,
and its complete acquiescence in the movement had to be secured by force
of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arbitrary action of the Holy Alliance.</div>

<p>It was in presence of these disturbances that the true principles of
the Holy Alliance began to show themselves. The three Eastern powers
seemed to consider themselves authorized to introduce into Europe a new
form of international law. Regarding themselves as the only legitimate
and divinely appointed powers, and holding themselves pledged to mutual
support against their enemies, and having declared their intention to act
as a brotherhood in international questions, they appear to have believed
that the enemies against whom their mutual assistance was required were
all those who resisted established authority, and that any disturbances
thus arising ought to be regulated by European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1373" id="Page_1373">[1373]</a></span>
congresses. In other words, they arrogated to themselves, for the sake
of suppressing what they considered revolutionary movements, the right
of federative action in the cause of legitimacy and absolutism. Already,
at Vienna and Aix-la-Chapelle, they had acted more or less on this
principle, and now they summoned a similar Congress
<span class="sidenote">England refuses to join.</span> at Troppau
(1820). It was impossible for an English minister to accede to this
new doctrine, however much he may have had at heart the cause which
the allied sovereigns were supporting, and Lord Castlereagh, as early
as April, declared that the alliance to which England was a party
existed for particular cases only, and was not to be generalized as the
Eastern sovereigns appeared to wish to generalize it. It shows how the
position of England had sunk under Castlereagh's management, that the
monarchs determined to act without England, and it shows the weakness of
Castlereagh's mode of action that he allowed, under these circumstances,
an English minister to be present at the meeting, not to take part in
the discussions, but merely to report their progress to his Government.
The Holy Alliance proceeded to act upon its own principles. In November
the English minister learnt that the three powers intended to join and
to act in common for the restoration of Ferdinand of Naples, whom they
had invited to meet them at Laibach, whither the Congress was adjourned.
Early in December 1820 a circular to that effect was issued in the name
of the three sovereigns, which, in spite of what Castlereagh had said,
proceeded to declare that, as what they were now doing was in accordance
with the late treaties, they felt no doubt of the adhesion of France
and England. On the 19th of that month, without knowledge of this
circular, Castlereagh wrote an explicit declaration that England would
not join in any united action. Had he openly declared this intention
and withdrawn the English ambassador he would not have acted otherwise
than as became an English minister. But on the 19th of January 1821 a
letter of Castlereagh's, purporting to be an answer to the circular
of December 8th, which had been published by some indiscretion in the
public prints, while reasserting the position he had taken up in his
previous declaration, went on to confess that the Government had looked
with the strongest disapproval on the insurrection in Naples. This weak
document, coming as it did just before the meeting of Parliament,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYONE_POPULAR_ANGER_AT_CASTLEREAGHS" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYONE_POPULAR_ANGER_AT_CASTLEREAGHS"></a>Popular anger at Castlereagh's weak policy. 1821.</span>
after the popular temper had been roused by the knowledge of the arrogant
circular of December, and taken in connection with the facts that
diplomatic relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1374" id="Page_1374">[1374]</a></span>
had not been renewed with the constitutional Government of Naples, and
that an English fleet was cruising off the coast, seemed to show that
the minister's heart was really with the sovereigns, and that his letter
was only written to suit party purposes in England. At the opening of
Parliament (Jan. 23, 1821) the Government had to withstand the most
bitter assaults from the Opposition, headed by Lords Grey and Holland
in the Lords, by Mackintosh, Brougham, and Tierney in the Lower House,
and although a public vote of censure, considering the constitution of
the House, was out of the question, it was plain that the feeling of all
parties was strong against the action of the Holy Alliance. The attacks
on the minister were still continuing when the uselessness of English
interference was demonstrated by the entrance of an Austrian army into
Italy, by which the revolution was summarily suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insurrection in Greece. March 1821.</div>

<p>It was not only in the West of Europe that difficulties arose. The
Christian populations under the power of the Ottoman Porte rose in
insurrection. They naturally looked, as they have always looked, to the
Czar for protection. Their method of proceeding was closely analogous
to that of the revolutionists in the rest of Europe; and in Greece, as
in Italy, secret societies were organized against the existing powers.
It has always been a part of Russian policy to secure as much influence
in Turkey as possible. On the other hand, it was impossible for the
English, at that time in constant diplomatic rivalry with Russia, to wish
to see that power in possession of Constantinople or the Black Sea. In
the affairs of Greece therefore a complete inversion of the principles
which had been predominant at the Congress of Troppau was visible. The
interests of Russia demanded that she should assist a revolutionary
movement backed up by secret societies and directed against a legitimate
sovereign, while England felt itself compelled to allege the doctrines
of legitimacy and to call to its aid old alliances in order to shelter
Turkey. The difficulty was so great that it was determined that this
question also should be referred to a Congress, which was held first at
Vienna, and subsequently moved to Verona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complications between France and Spain. 1821.</div>

<p>But meanwhile fresh complications had arisen in the West. A terrible
visitation of the yellow fever had come upon Spain. Under pretext of
excluding the infection from their own country, the French had massed
troops along the borders; but it soon became evident that something
beyond sanitary precautions had inspired this movement. When the illness
disappeared there was still an army of 100,000 men lying within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1375" id="Page_1375">[1375]</a></span>
reach of the Pyrenees. In fact, the Legitimists of France had seen
with extreme dislike the revolution in Spain; it was political
infection they were chiefly anxious to avoid, and the more advanced
members of that party, which had a large majority in the French
Houses, were thinking of the invasion of Spain, and the re-establishment
by force of arms of the absolutist rule of Ferdinand. Lord
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTWO_CONGRESS_AT_VERONA" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTWO_CONGRESS_AT_VERONA"></a>Congress at Verona. Sept. 1822.</span> Londonderry
was preparing to attend the Congress at Verona when his health and reason
gave way and he committed suicide. In his place the Duke of Wellington
attended the Congress, and was somewhat surprised to find that, instead
of the Greek question, the real point at issue was the demand of France
for a joint action on the part of the Legitimist Courts of Europe to
suppress the revolution in Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of Canning's policy.</div>

<p>It was to the management of this difficult affair that Canning was
called. It cannot be said that he introduced a new system into our
diplomacy. He had been a party to some of the declarations of his
predecessor, and had accepted the responsibility of them. In fact, as
has been seen in his public despatches, Castlereagh had already declared
the impossibility of English co-operation in any general scheme of
repressive action on the Continent, and his dislike to the government
of Europe by congresses. It is the way in which Canning acted up to
and rendered practical those declarations which makes it possible to
say that his accession to office was an era in English politics. His
instructions to Wellington were clear and precise. If a declaration of
any such determination&mdash;that is, of joint action&mdash;should be
made at Verona, come what might the Duke was to refuse the King's consent
to become a party to it, even though the dissolution of the alliance
should be the consequence of his refusal. Canning's object was to secure
European peace and to allow nations freedom of choice as to their own
government&mdash;to re-establish, in fact, in England and throughout
Europe a policy based upon national grounds, as distinguished from that
system of united and general policy by means of European congresses under
which Europe since the peace had been labouring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Partial success of Canning's diplomacy in
Spain.</div>

<p>In the first of his objects Canning was partially successful. The
distinct refusal of Wellington to join in united action, and his
subsequent withdrawal from the Congress, prevented a general European
attack upon Spain. He could not entirely prevent the war, but he
succeeded in reducing it to the dimensions of a national war. He used his
best endeavours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1376" id="Page_1376">[1376]</a></span>
persuade France not to attack Spain. He declared that the free
institutions of the Spanish people could not, as the French King had
asserted, be only held legitimately from the spontaneous gift of the
sovereign; the Spanish nation could not be expected to subscribe to that
principle, nor could any British statesman uphold or defend it; it was
in fact a principle that struck at the root of the British Constitution.
In his eagerness to avert hostilities he even entreated the Spaniards
to make changes in their constitution. His efforts on both sides were
vain. The French invaded Spain; on the 2nd of May 1823 they entered
Madrid; on the 1st of October Cadiz was surrendered, and Ferdinand and
his absolute government were re-established. But in the matter of English
interests Canning declared himself plainly. Portugal might be involved,
and an effort might be made by Spain, with the assistance of France, to
reconquer her colonies. Should Portugal join with Spain voluntarily,
England would take no notice; but if that country were invaded, England
would of necessity come to the assistance of her old ally. With regard to
the colonies he took a similar ground. They were virtually independent;
during the contest, true to his principle of neutrality, he had abetted
Government in preventing Englishmen from joining the insurgents; but
the trade with the colonies being now open, the interests of England
were so involved with their independence that he would not allow any
foreign nation to join in reconquering them; if Spain was itself unable
to subdue them, no foreign country, he declared, should subdue them for
her. He followed up this policy by declaring that he would send English
consuls to protect British trade, and their appointment was in fact the
recognition of the independence of the colonies.</p>

<p>The new minister's conduct at the negotiations at Verona was subjected
to warm discussion at the beginning of the year 1823. The firm attitude
of neutrality which he had taken up did not satisfy the aspirations of
those who looked upon his accession to office as the triumph of the Whig
party. But his vindication was so complete that, upon the division, the
opinion of the House appeared to be quite unanimous. The Opposition was
only twenty in a House of 372, and of those twenty some were professed
ministerialists, who had been shut out from voting by the crowd of their
own adherents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_CHANGES_IN_COMMERCIAL_POLICY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_CHANGES_IN_COMMERCIAL_POLICY"></a>Change in commercial policy effected by
Huskisson.</div>

<p>But it was not only in our foreign policy that a change of spirit now
became obvious. In the winter of 1823, a few months after the accession
of Canning to office, further changes took place in the ministry. Mr.
Vansittart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1377" id="Page_1377">[1377]</a></span>
resigned the place of Chancellor of the Exchequer, for which he was
very unfit, and went into the Upper House as Lord Bexley. Mr. Robinson
(afterwards Lord Goderich) succeeded him, and, much more important,
Mr. Huskisson was in January made President of the Board of Trade, and
with him a complete alteration came over our commercial policy, and
the reign of restriction began to give way and yield place to free
trade. The questions at issue had not yet become party tests, as they
subsequently were, and Huskisson, as member of a Tory ministry, was
able by his comprehension of the true principles of trade to set on
foot a new system without separating from his colleagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Financial condition of England.</div>

<p>The expenses of the war had been enormous, perhaps inevitably so,
and the taxes were proportionately heavy. During the last year of
the war in taxes and loans upwards of £170,000,000 had been raised.
The National Debt amounted to nearly £800,000,000, and to meet the
necessities of the moment this had been raised by very expensive
methods, so that the nominal sum on which interest was paid was
considerably higher than the actual money which had passed into
Government hands. Mr. Vansittart, who had had the management of the
finances, had no real knowledge of financial principles, and had acted
on the simple plan of increasing taxes when more money was necessary,
and supplying the deficit by loans contracted in an extravagant
fashion, or taken from the sinking fund. He did not see that doubling a
tax by no means doubled the returns from it, as it inevitably compelled
some people, and those the most numerous and poorest, to surrender the
taxed article; and in common with many people at the time, he believed
in the magical effect of the sinking fund, although the sum yearly
paid to it was derived from loans contracted at considerably higher
interest than the fund itself bore. The sinking fund indeed had, in the
hands of the present Government, almost lost its original object, and
was openly declared both by Vansittart and Castlereagh to be chiefly
useful for supplying the ministry with an easy means of getting money
to meet emergencies, instead of a sacred deposit to be used only for
the extinction of debt. The ease with which all money demands of
Government were granted during the war had also engendered a spirit of
extravagance, and economy had been one of the earliest cries of the
Opposition on the resumption of peace. At first the support of the
large standing army which still remained on foot, and other expenses
which were regarded as necessary, had apparently prevented any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1378" id="Page_1378">[1378]</a></span>
relaxation of taxes, but by degrees the universal discontent excited
by their pressure had compelled Government to grant some relief, and a
certain number of taxes had been taken off or reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resources of the country restricted by
protective laws.</div>

<p>But all this time the real resources of England, the development
of which would have largely increased the revenue, and at the same
time have admitted of large decrease of taxation, had been restricted
by unwise commercial legislation, having its origin in distant times
and in a different state of society. The interests of the landowners
and agriculturists were so closely connected with the predominance of
the Tory party, and they had played so large a part in the conduct of
England of late years, that the agriculturists had succeeded in making
good the advantages of their class to the detriment of all others.
They claimed nothing less than the exclusive right of supplying the
whole nation with food, and by their clamour and influence in the House
of Commons had succeeded in procuring corn laws which went far to
secure them that monopoly. But meanwhile, within the last fifty years,
the manufacturing interest, principally through the introduction of
machinery, had relatively enormously increased. In the twenty years
between 1811 and 1831, while the agricultural population increased
but 2½ per cent., the manufacturing population had increased 31½ per
cent. The time was rapidly approaching when the growing and increasing
manufacturing and commercial element would of necessity claim its due
position in opposition to the landed aristocracy. But at present the
manufacturers themselves, ignorant of the true principles of political
economy, were constantly seeking the benefit of their own class as
distinguished from that of the general public, and restrictive, or,
as they were called, protective, laws were extended over nearly every
branch of industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes effected by Robinson and Huskisson.</div>

<p>Robinson, an exceedingly well-meaning man, had succeeded Vansittart
as Chancellor of the Exchequer. But his plans and resources extended
but little beyond those of his predecessor. He accepted and kept in
operation some of his most unwise financial measures, and, without any
change of general view, continued, what was no doubt a good thing in
its way, to remit occasionally various small taxes. But he had beside
him Huskisson as President of the Board of Trade, who acted in a very
different spirit. Like his friend Canning, who gave him his full
support, he was a self-made man, and belonging to none of the prominent
ruling classes, was able to look at matters in a broader and more
national light. And though, like his friend, he was constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1379" id="Page_1379">[1379]</a></span>
spoken of as an adventurer, and in consequence had to undergo much
opposition, he was able by the reasonableness of his views, and by the
success which attended their execution, to launch England upon a new
course of commercial policy, as Canning had been able to do with regard
to foreign affairs. As yet free trade as a whole was not to be thought
of, but Huskisson took every advantage of the demands of various
classes of industrialists to introduce small reforms. In his first
year of office, though he indicated the tendency of his policy, he was
not able to affect much except with regard to the navigation laws.
The three great industries of England were wool, silk, and cotton. Of
these cotton alone had been left unrestricted, and there alone had a
very remarkable increase been seen. In the wool trade considerable
depression having been felt, numerous petitions from manufacturers were
presented begging for the free importation of foreign wool, but at the
same time asking that the export of British wool should be forbidden;
in other words, claiming to buy the raw material of their manufacture
at a price artificially lowered. Government replied that the import
tax was a valuable source of revenue, but that it should be willingly
foregone if free export was allowed also. As the manufacturers declined
this, the movement for the present dropped. In the same way an attempt
was made to free the Spitalfields silk manufacture from restrictions,
such as the settlement of their wages by the magistrates. It was plain
that as long as wages were not allowed to change with the varying
requirements of the trade, the manufacturers were under disadvantages
as compared with their rivals elsewhere. But 11,000 of the journeymen
petitioned against this change, and although the Bill passed the Lower
House by small majorities, it was so altered by amendments in the Upper
House that Huskisson thought fit to drop it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change of the Navigation Act. June 1823.</div>

<p>In dealing with the Navigation Act he was more successful. This
law, passed in Cromwell's time, and completed in the 12th of Charles
II., allowed the produce of Asia, Africa, and America to be brought
to England in English ships only, and European goods only in English
ships or in ships of the country producing the goods. The close of
the American War had given the first blow to this system. American
shipping, now become the shipping of a foreign country, was subject to
the restrictions of the Act. The Americans retaliated, and the ships
of both countries had to perform one half of the voyage empty; the
consumers therefore paid double freight. This absurdity continued till
the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, when the Governments agreed to drop their
restrictions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1380" id="Page_1380">[1380]</a></span>
The course which had been successful with America was subsequently
adopted by the mercantile states of Europe. Portugal, the Netherlands,
and Prussia, all raised the dues on British vessels, and Huskisson,
on the 6th of June 1823, took the opportunity of introducing the Bill
known by the name of the Reciprocity of Duties Bill, by which the ships
of British and foreign powers were put upon an equal footing, the right
being retained to keep up restrictive duties upon the ships of nations
who rejected the reciprocal equality of trade thus offered. The outcry
against this change was very great, especially among the shipowners,
whose business was trammelled by the heavy duty on Baltic timber.
Huskisson expressed a hope that this duty might shortly be remitted,
and meanwhile offered to return to shipbuilders all the duties paid on
their materials. The offer was declined, and the grumbling continued,
nevertheless the increase of British ships was enormous; in the last
nineteen years of the restrictive duties the tonnage had increased
ten per cent.; in twenty-one years after their abolition it increased
forty-five per cent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_IMPROVEMENT_IN_THE_SILK_TRADE" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_IMPROVEMENT_IN_THE_SILK_TRADE"></a>Improvement in the silk trade. March 1824.</div>

<p>The first failure of his plans did not dishearten Huskisson, and the
prosperity of the year 1824 enabled him to carry Bills for the relief
both of the wool and silk trades. The silk trade had been principally
established in England by the persecuted Protestants in 1685, and to
support it laws had been passed excluding from England foreign silks,
which had previously been admitted free. Early in the eighteenth
century the spinning of silk in the Italian method had been introduced
by two brothers of the name of Lombe; to protect them heavy duties were
laid upon foreign-spun silk. The material for the manufacture of silk
goods was thus raised in price, and the manufacture had languished for
many years, especially after the introduction of cotton. The production
of spun silk in India, whence it was very plentifully supplied, had
lately improved this state of things; it was believed that at this
time 400,000 people were employed in the manufacture of silk goods.
But there was a distinct preference for silks of French manufacture,
and the smuggling of such goods into England was a serious damage both
to the trade and to the revenue. The silk manufacturers, especially
those about London, had immediately, upon Huskisson's accession to
office, petitioned for the removal of duties on spun silk, but at the
same time, with true class feeling, were eager to exclude foreign
manufactured silks. In the same way the silk spinners were eager for
the removal of duties upon raw silk, but bitterly opposed to the
introduction of spun silk, while the journeymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1381" id="Page_1381">[1381]</a></span>
believed that ruin stared them in the face if foreign manufactured
silks were introduced. Between these varying interests Huskisson had
to steer his course. The duty on raw silk was immediately reduced to
threepence from five and sevenpence halfpenny the pound. The clamour
was too great to allow of a similar reduction in the duties on spun
silk, which were lowered about half, from fourteen and eightpence
to seven and sixpence; and similarly, though Mr. Huskisson wished
for an immediate change, the admission of foreign manufactured silks
was postponed for two years, when they were to be admitted at an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad
valorem</i> duty of thirty per cent. The outcry against the change was
great; the workmen thanked the House for the temporary postponement of
the day of their destruction; the manufacturers expressed a hope that
they should get out of the trade before the fatal day arrived. But the
event thoroughly proved the wisdom of Huskisson's plans, and the truth
of his prophecy that competition only was wanted to enable English
manufacturers to rival the French; ten years after the passing of the
Bill England exported to France £60,000 worth of manufactured silk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvement in the wool trade.</div>

<p>The duties on wool, which came next into consideration, were of
newer creation. In 1803 it had been subjected to a tax of a halfpenny a
pound, raised by Mr. Vansittart in 1819 to sixpence. The same variety
of interests was here at work as in the silk trade. The agriculturists
and wool-growers wished for the retention of duties to secure a
monopoly of the supply of wool, the manufacturers, to whom foreign
wool for certain purposes is an absolute necessity, wished for free
importation, but for the retention of an export duty to keep the price
of English wool low. With perfect justice Mr. Huskisson determined
to relieve both classes. Foreign wool was admitted, according to its
excellence, at a penny or a halfpenny a pound; English wool might
be exported at a similar rate. Again the effect justified his view.
The fear of a large exportation of English wool proved so completely
groundless that by 1826 only 100,000 pounds weight had been exported,
while 40,000,000 pounds of foreign wool had been introduced. The low
price of wool of which the growers had complained had been caused by
the increase of the article in England and the general slackness of the
trade; the large introduction of foreign wool had enabled the British
producers to sell all their stock at remunerative prices to be worked
up with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_DISCUSSION_ON_SLAVERY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_DISCUSSION_ON_SLAVERY"></a>Reintroduction of the question of slavery.</div>

<p>As befitted the dawning liberality of the English legislation,
the question of the slave trade now again came prominently forward.
It was indeed the late changes in commercial legislation which again
brought it into notice. Since the opening of the Indian trade in
April 1814 a complete alteration had taken place in the character
of our commerce with that country. Originally restricted to Indian
produce paid for in bullion, it had lately become much extended; India
received from England woollen goods to the value of a million and a
half, and strangely enough even cotton goods, originally an Indian
production, to the value of upwards of a million. But as the duties on
East India sugar were higher than those charged on West India sugar,
India was practically unable to pay for the goods thus imported with
its sugar. It was urged in Parliament, that as the power of India
to receive English goods was limited only by what it could give in
exchange, one great source of purchasing power was thus denied it, and
that an equality of duties should be established. Of course the West
India interests were violent in opposition, but while objecting to
the change at present, Huskisson allowed that the production of slave
labour was more costly than that of free labour, and that slavery was
not only a crime but a commercial mistake. This confession called
the abolitionists again into activity. They had already succeeded in
getting the trade condemned by most civilized nations, and the slave
who touched English ground was free; but the institution continued
in all its severity in our own colonies. Sir Fowell Buxton, who now
became the prominent supporter of abolition, brought in a resolution
(May 15, 1823) declaring that slavery should be gradually abolished
throughout the British colonies. Gradual abolition presents great
difficulties. It is not logical, as slavery is either right or wrong;
it is difficult to carry out, because slaves still left unenfranchized,
while others are freed, are naturally discontented. Canning therefore
distinctly objected to the motion; he declared that no half measures
were possible, and that as for immediate abolition the Constitution
of England was against it. At the same time he proposed resolutions
declaring the expediency of improving the condition of the
<span class="sidenote">Effect of Canning's circular in Jamaica.</span>
slaves preparatory to freedom. This was followed up in a circular
issued on the 24th of May 1823, ordering the cessation of the use
of the whip in the field and of the flogging of women. The circular
excited great anger among the planters, the House of Assembly in
Jamaica began to talk of independence and of addressing the King
to remove Lord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary. In Barbadoes the
mean whites, that is, those who possessed no slaves and who were the
outcasts of society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1383" id="Page_1383">[1383]</a></span>
rose in riot, and razed to the ground the chapel of a missionary who
had spoken of them as an ignorant and depraved class. In Demerara the
purport of the circular and the way in which it was spoken of by the
planters came to the ears of the negroes, and caused a rising (Aug.
18), which was only kept from becoming a dangerous insurrection by
the influence of an Independent missionary of the name of Smith. In
two days the riot was quelled, with considerable bloodshed and nearly
fifty executions of negroes. But the importance of the affair lies
chiefly in the conduct of the whites and the Government of the island
towards Mr. Smith. There had already been some efforts made to injure
the influence of the dissenting missionaries, who had been most active
in instructing the negroes, and <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_PERSECUTION_OF_MR_SMITH" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_PERSECUTION_OF_MR_SMITH"></a>Persecution
of Mr. Smith.</span> although a clergyman of the Episcopalian Church
who was in Demerara gave full testimony of Mr. Smith's excellence,
he was apprehended, kept in a disgraceful prison for two months, and
then died of his hardships (Feb. 6, 1824). Before he died he had been
sentenced to death, as having been aware of the intended rising. The
sentence of the court-martial was quashed in England, but before the
news arrived he was dead. The treatment of Smith in his imprisonment,
and of his widow, who was not even allowed to be present at his
funeral, was marked by great cruelty, and his death was followed by a
meeting of slave-owners, who petitioned that all missionaries should
be expelled from the colony, and prohibited from coming there for
the future. In fact, they declared that any attempt to improve the
moral or intellectual condition of the slaves was undesirable and a
crime against the planters. The shock given by this violent action to
the public feeling in England virtually secured the predominance of
abolitionist views.</p>

<p>The years 1823 and 1824 were thus marked by a distinct advance in
liberality on the part of the English Government. But the beneficent
action of Huskisson's legislation was postponed during the following
year by a period of unexampled distress. During the past year there
had been much hope of increased prosperity. The opening of
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFIVE_DISASTROUS_EFFECTS_OF_SPECULATIONS" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFIVE_DISASTROUS_EFFECTS_OF_SPECULATIONS"></a>Misery caused by wild speculation. 1825.</span>
new markets in South America had excited the hope of speedy profits,
and introduced a spirit of rash speculation which has more than once
disastrously affected British commerce. The consequence was the very
rapid formation of a vast number of joint-stock companies, with their
attendant symptoms of unprincipled stock-jobbing and dishonesty on the
part of financial agents and promoters of companies. It is impossible
not to be reminded of the similar excitement in the time of the South Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1384" id="Page_1384">[1384]</a></span>
Bubble,&mdash;again acts of fabulous folly were performed; it is
said that in their eagerness to get a sale for British goods both
warming-pans and skates were exported in considerable numbers to
the Tropics; while a company of Scotch milk-maids was formed and
transferred to Buenos Ayres, where, after conquering the preliminary
difficulty of milking wild cattle, it was found that the inhabitants
would not eat butter, and preferred the oil of their own country.
Though many schemes to be carried on in foreign parts did not even
take the trouble to secure charters, 286 private Bills were passed in
the session of 1825. The speculation was assisted by a great apparent
profusion of money, and by the careless action of both the Bank of
England and the private provincial banks. In spite of signs that gold
and silver were leaving the country, the Bank of England continued to
increase its issue of notes, and the provincial banks followed its
example; there was far too much paper money in the country; between
June 1824 and October 1825 ten millions of coin and bullion were
exported. At the same time the Bank of England lowered its rate of
interest. Money was thus exceedingly easily obtained, and prices rose
suddenly and very rapidly. The readiness of all the banks to discount
bills even at long dates enabled speculators to buy up and hold back
goods, thus still further raising the prices. There was naturally soon
an end of this fictitious state of things. As the goods which had been
bought up were brought into the market their prices necessarily fell;
foreign speculations could not produce very rapid returns; the insecure
bills, or those which had been discounted at very long dates, could
not be realized, consequently the banks found it difficult to meet the
demands upon them; the Bank of England then took alarm, raised the rate
at which it discounted bills, and contracted the issue of bank notes.
In all ways therefore money began to get exceedingly scarce; firms and
companies began to break, credit was shaken, a run on the banks was the
consequence. At length even the London houses were affected, and on
the 5th of December the great banking-house of Pole &amp; Company, on
which as many as forty-four country banks depended, broke. In six weeks
between sixty to seventy banks had stopped payment, of which six or
seven were London houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Success of the healing measures of the
Government.</div>

<p>The misery attendant on these disasters was so great that the
Government thought it necessary to interfere. The bank and the mint set
hard to work to supply notes and coin; 150,000 sovereigns a day were
turned out, but even thus, the story is told that the credit of the
Bank was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1385" id="Page_1385">[1385]</a></span>
saved by the accidental discovery of a forgotten chest with 700,000
one-pound notes. By the end of the year the worst of the panic was
over, but during 1826 bankruptcies continued with fearful rapidity. In
the opinion of the Government some part of the late misfortune was to
be attributed to bad legislation, and might be altered, but the greater
part arose from a spirit of over-speculation, over which no legislative
enactments could have any power. The healing measures proposed were the
prohibition of the issue of one and two pound notes; for it began to be
generally acknowledged that unrestricted paper currency could not exist
with coin, that in times of prosperity the paper would be preferred,
gold and silver would seek other markets, and in times of necessity
would be unprocurable. Many of the banks had paid for the privilege
of issuing notes, but the Government risked the infringement on their
rights, acknowledging it, and confessing that an Act of indemnity
would be necessary. Secondly, they induced the Bank directors to give
up one of their privileges, by which private banking-houses were
restricted to six partners. Beyond a radius of sixty-five miles from
London, the number of partners was henceforward unlimited, and much
greater security was thus obtained. At the same time, for the instant
relief of commerce, the ministers, unwilling to issue Exchequer bills,
because they thought that commerce had better on the whole be left to
right itself, succeeded in persuading the Bank to advance £3,000,000
to merchants upon the security of their goods. The effect of these
measures was a restoration of credit and the gradual subsidence of the
alarm.</p>

<p>But the misfortunes of the preceding years had of necessity been
attended by extreme suffering among the poorer classes, and although
they had on the whole borne their privations remarkably well, it was
<span class="sidenote">Riots and machine breaking. April 1826.</span>
impossible, considering the excited temper of the times, to avoid
riots. These were as usual directed principally against machinery,
which was still ignorantly regarded by the artisans as the chief cause
of their misery. The riots were very widely spread, every power-loom
in Blackburn was smashed, the operatives in Manchester held stormy
meetings, and in Carlisle, Staffordshire, and Norfolk uproars took
place. To the miseries caused by depression of trade were added those
of an unfavourable season; the summer of 1826 was marked by a very
severe drought. On all grounds, therefore, the ministers thought it

till prices should rise to the level which allowed importation, should
be released at once and sent into the market, and that Government
should be authorized to import, within a space of two months, 500,000
quarters more. Bills to this effect were passed through the House,
having been earnestly pressed forward because the Parliament was on the
point of dissolution, and had the ministers been obliged to open the
ports without leave, their conduct would have been unconstitutional and
would have required an Act of indemnity. But, after all, their efforts
were unavailing; prices rose, so that on the 1st of September the legal
price was reached; but as it was only when the average price was above
a certain point that corn was admitted, and a month must elapse before
that average could be taken, it was thought desirable to forestall the
time and open them at once. The new Parliament assembled in November,
and remained a short time in session for the purpose of giving the
required indemnity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canning's vigorous policy in Portugal. Dec.
1826.</div>

<p>The attention of Parliament was called to one other important topic,
which may be regarded as the finishing stroke to Canning's foreign
policy. It will be remembered that he had always declared that any
attack on Portugal would be regarded as a sufficient cause for the
entrance of England into the war. The French troops still occupied
Spain, and in the civil war which was continued in that country the
royalists had been joined by several regiments of the Portuguese army.
In spite of urgent demands and repeated promises that these deserting
troops should be disbanded, they were allowed, if not encouraged, by
the Spanish royalists to make inroads into constitutional Portugal.
The Princess Regent applied to England for assistance; Canning at once
acted vigorously according to his principles. At first the information
given was not accurate, but on Friday the 8th of December precise
information arrived, and Canning could triumphantly assert in the
House&mdash;"On Saturday his Majesty's confidential servants came to a
decision, on Sunday that decision received the sanction of his Majesty,
on Monday it was submitted to both Houses of Parliament, and this day
(Tuesday) on which I have the honour of addressing you the troops are
on their march for embarkation." It was plain to all men that the
honour of England was safe in such hands, and proof was afforded to all
Europe that England had distinctly broken from her old connections; and
that her sympathies were on the side of political freedom and national
independence.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the changes worked by Canning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1387" id="Page_1387">[1387]</a></span>
by Huskisson, and the decided preponderance of the more liberal-minded
members of the Cabinet, were regarded with favour by all their
colleagues. Personally distasteful to many of them because of
their want of aristocratic connection, the innovating character of
their policy, and their views, which were closely assimilated on
most points to those of the Whigs separated them entirely from the
representatives of the old Tory party. They seem to have had but one
point in common&mdash;their opposition to parliamentary reform. Lord
Liverpool's Government had from the first been one of compromise.
One of the greatest questions of the day, which had already caused
the fall of more than one ministry, had been allowed to fall from
the list of Cabinet questions, and it had been agreed that Catholic
emancipation should stand entirely upon its own merits. But this was
a point on which men felt very keenly, and there had thus arisen a
complete division in the ministry; on the one side were ranked the
followers of Canning, including such men as Huskisson, Wellesley;
Robinson, Sturges-Bourne, and Lord Palmerston; and on the other the
high Tory or Protestant party, at the head of which was Liverpool
himself, Lord Eldon, and the Duke of Wellington, and, although he
was regarded as less bigoted, Peel. How great the split between the
parties was is made plain not only by the strong if decorous language
to be found in Lord Eldon's correspondence, but by the more outspoken
expressions of Palmerston in his private letters. In the election of
1826, though himself a member of the ministry, Palmerston had been
opposed at Cambridge by Goulbourn (also one of the administration),
and all the influence of the Tory section had been used against him.
In a letter describing the effects of that election, he says, "As to
the commonplace balance between Opposition and Government, the election
will have little effect upon it. The Government are as strong as any
government can wish to be, as far as regards those who sit facing
them; but in truth the real Opposition of the present day sit behind
the Treasury bench. It is by the stupid old Tory party, who bawl
out the memory and praises of Pitt, while they are opposing all the
measures and principles which he held most important, it is by these
that the progress of the Government in every improvement which they
are attempting is thwarted and opposed. On the Catholic question, on
the principles of commerce, on the corn laws, on the settlement of
the currency, on the laws regulating the trade in money, on colonial
slavery, on the game laws, which are intimately connected with the
moral habits of the people; on all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1388" id="Page_1388">[1388]</a></span>
questions, and everything like them, the Government find support
from the Whigs and resistance from their self-denominated friends."
While again, speaking of the foolish obstruction to the Catholic
claims, he writes of his colleagues in most unmeasured terms: "I
can forgive old women like the Chancellor, spoonies like Liverpool,
ignoramuses like Westmoreland, old stumped-up Tories like
Bathurst, but how such a man as Peel, liberal, enlightened,
and fresh-minded, should find himself running in such a pack
is hardly intelligible." It is plain that a Government thinking
so differently on the most important topics of the day must have
been near its dissolution. It was held together in fact only by the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_ILLNESS_OF_LORD_LIVERPOOL" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_ILLNESS_OF_LORD_LIVERPOOL"></a>Illness of Lord Liverpool. Feb. 1827.</span>
tact and personal influence of Lord Liverpool; and when, on the 17th
February, the Premier was found struck with an apoplectic fit it was
certain that a ministerial crisis must arise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties attending the formation of a new
ministry.</div>

<p>The difficulty in the formation of a new permanent Government
was likely to be increased by the two great questions which were
expected to occupy the session. One of these was a change in the corn
laws, and an attempt to bring them more into harmony with the new
commercial views of Huskisson and his friends; the other the Catholic
emancipation, on which already the existing Cabinet was so much
divided. The constant repetition of temporary measures required by the
existing state of the law, <span class="sidenote">Necessity of a
change in the corn laws.</span> the fluctuation of prices, and the
consequent suffering of the poor, proved to those who were not pledged
to the interests of the landowning and agricultural party that some
alteration in the arrangements with regard to corn was necessary. With
much care Canning and Huskisson, although both were too ill to allow of
personal communication, had arranged a joint measure, by which foreign
corn might be imported free of duty, to be warehoused and admitted
to the market for home consumption, regardless of the price of corn,
on the payment of duties varying in accordance with a certain scale;
when wheat was at seventy shillings the duty was to be one shilling,
and to increase two shillings with every decrease of one shilling in
price. The Bill was passed on the 12th of April, during the interval
it was thought decent to allow for the possible restoration of Lord
Liverpool's health. It did not come on in the Upper House till after
the new Government was formed, but it was there thrown out in favour of
an amendment produced by the Duke of Wellington, declaring that foreign
corn should not be taken out of bond till corn had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1389" id="Page_1389">[1389]</a></span>
reached sixty-six shillings. The object of the Bill, which was to
supply foreign corn whenever the sale of it was remunerative, was thus
entirely frustrated and the Bill abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing importance of the Catholic
question.</div>

<p>It was during the same period, while the Government was in abeyance,
that the Roman Catholic question was brought on. The settlement of this
question in one way or other had become almost a necessity. It has been
seen how Pitt was compelled, by fear of the old King's health, to give
up a cause which he undoubtedly regarded as just, and how the obstinacy
of George III. upon the same point had ruined Lord Grenville's
ministry. During Mr. Perceval's ministry, which was formed on the
avowed principle of withstanding the claims of the Catholics, the
dangers attendant upon the war afforded sufficient excuse for alleging
that the time was inconvenient to move so critical a question; but
during the whole of that period they had, by means of an organization
and the establishment of a central Catholic committee, kept their
claims before the world, waiting till a favourable time should come.
Lord Liverpool had found it impossible, as already stated, to form
a ministry unanimous on the point, and year after year, as Bills in
favour of the Catholics were introduced in the House, Castlereagh and
Canning had been seen supporting them in opposition to most of their
colleagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disturbances in Ireland.</div>

<p>In Ireland, meanwhile, the question had naturally become the
watchword of parties, and, like every other political question in that
country, had assumed a national form and was leading to a division of
races. Both the Protestant Orange Lodges and the Catholic Associations
of White Boys had again sprung into existence, and so great was the
disorder that in 1822 the Habeas Corpus Act had been suspended. At
the same time, in agreement with the uncertain and half-hearted
policy of Lord Liverpool's Government, Lord Wellesley, a favourer
of the Catholic claims, was made Lord-Lieutenant, and Plunkett (in
whose hands the chief management of Catholic parliamentary affairs
was) Attorney-General, but yoked to Mr Goulbourn, who was a strong
anti-Catholic, as Chief Secretary. The hopes of the Irish, not
unreasonably raised by <span class="sidenote">Failure of Wellesley's
administration. 1822.</span> these appointments, were disappointed.
Received upon his arrival with every sign of admiration and attachment,
before long Wellesley was publicly assaulted and pelted in the
theatres. He had attempted, in the midst of the wild excitement of the
passionate Irishmen of both parties, to follow a cool and impartial
policy. His chief object was to suppress secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1390" id="Page_1390">[1390]</a></span>
societies and to compel all parties to submit quietly to the law. By
the use of very stringent measures, by the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus Act, and by the Insurrection Act, which allowed him to
establish where necessary something nearly equivalent to martial
law, he had succeeded in weakening the secret societies and in
lessening the amount of crime; he thus earned for himself the
hearty dislike of the extreme Catholics. At the same time the
restraint which he put upon the Orange societies and Protestant
demonstrations roused the extreme Protestants to fury, so that riots
took place in Dublin which could only be checked by the military.
He thus laid himself open to the charges brought against him by the
ultra-Protestants of England, who urged, with a show of truth, that
he had proved himself inefficient, and that it was plain that lenity
and conciliatory measures would not produce the expected effect.
And now, seeing that their hopes in their Lord-Lieutenant were
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_THE_CATHOLIC_ASSOCIATION" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_THE_CATHOLIC_ASSOCIATION"></a>Formation of the Catholic Association.
1823.</span> not realized, and wishing to gain favour with classes to
whom secret societies were abhorrent, the Catholic party of Ireland,
under the leadership of O'Connell, set on foot the great organization
known as the Catholic Association, which, while it held aloof from
secret societies, and kept itself as far as possible within the
limits of the law, was inspired as completely with fanaticism as any
of its predecessors had been. Its avowed object was the preparation
of petitions to Parliament; but it held regular sessions, had
its committee of grievances, ordered a census of the population,
and exacted a tax known as the Catholic rent. The effect of this
Association was for a time to alienate the Catholics of England, and
to make the question a more distinctly national one, and by 1825 the
Association had become so formidable that, by a large majority, a Bill
was passed rendering it illegal and attempting to dissolve it. The Bill
declared that political associations were incapable of adjournment for
more than fourteen days, incapable of having corresponding societies,
of levying contributions, or of requiring oaths. The dissolution of the
Association was only nominal, a new Association was immediately formed,
and the Catholic body were advised to proceed by all political and
legal means.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_REJECTION_OF_BILL" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_REJECTION_OF_BILL"></a>Rejection of the Catholic Relief Bill. 1826.</div>

<p>The Catholics had in fact gained a very important step in compelling
Parliament to recognize the existence of the Association. It was no
longer possible to postpone the consideration of their claims, and in
March 1826, Sir Francis Burdett brought in what was called a Relief
Bill, of which O'Connell, entirely falsely, claimed to be the chief
author. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1391" id="Page_1391">[1391]</a></span>
the Bill for the relief of disabilities there were two subsidiary Bills,
the one raising the Catholic franchise to £10 instead of £2, which was
thought to be a sop to the Protestants, the other to supply a State
provision for the Catholic clergy, by which it was thought the other
party might be pleased. Freed from the dread of the Association, the
English partisans of the Catholic claims used all their influence and
eloquence in favour of the Bill, and it passed the Commons by a considerable
majority. Its fate in the House of Lords was different. It
there encountered an opposition verging upon the unconstitutional;
the Duke of York, the heir to the crown, adopting all his father's
old scruples, declared, in distinct allusion to his probable succession
to the throne, that under no circumstances and in no position would
he assent to such a Bill. He succeeded in obtaining its rejection by
a majority of forty-eight. The Duke's action was highly popular; it
seems pretty certain that the feeling of the majority of Englishmen
was against the Catholics. The plea that the Coronation Oath stood
in the way of the royal assent to such a Bill no longer found defenders
except with the extremest Tories, but the feeling of race which had been
excited, the fear, not wholly ungrounded, that a measure so anxiously
desired by the priests must hide some considerable advantage to the
Roman Church, and the occasional rash declaration of some furious
partisan that obedience to the Papal See was superior to any earthly
obedience, made the majority of those who were not guided by reason
and principle desire to retain the disabilities which still existed.
The effect of their defeat in the House of Lords was not to dishearten
the Catholics, on the contrary, they took courage at their success in
the Commons, and were only eager if possible to complete their
triumph before the accession of the bigoted Duke of York should

1827.</span> throw a fresh obstacle in their way. A Catholic petition
was therefore prepared, which Sir Francis Burdett presented during the
illness of Lord Liverpool, proposing at the same time a resolution that
the affairs of Ireland required immediate and earnest attention. But
an election had taken place since the last Bill had been introduced,
and the anti-Catholic feeling had apparently gained ground in the new
Parliament; in spite of all the support which Canning could give it,
the resolution was rejected. It was the last defeat the champions of
emancipation were destined to meet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canning Prime Minister. April 10, 1827.</div>

<p>While Canning was thus defeated on the two questions he had
most at heart,&mdash;the improvement of the corn laws and
the Catholic emancipation,&mdash;he found himself called
upon to undertake the duties of Prime Minister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1392" id="Page_1392">[1392]</a></span>
There was indeed no one in the existing ministry who could
well compete with him, and the popular voice at once nominated
him as Lord Liverpool's successor. Yet from the first it was clear
that his appointment implied a complete change of ministry. It was
not to be expected that his opponents in the Cabinet, whether on
aristocratic and personal or on political grounds, would consent to
serve under him. The King, who had lately been drawing more
towards the anti-Catholic party, himself hesitated, but when a cabal
of Tory Lords threatened him with the loss of their support should
he appoint Canning, his mind was at once made up to resent the
affront, and Canning was sent for. His appointment was followed
by the resignation of all the most important members of the
ministry; Wellington, Melville, Eldon, Bathurst, Westmoreland,
Bexley, and Peel, chiefly on account of the obligations under
which he felt as member for the Protestant University of Oxford,
with several less important ministers, withdrew. As Canning was
willing to consent that the Catholic question should still remain
open, this great defection seems to show how clearly defined his
general liberal tendencies had become. From among his own friends,
<span class="sidenote">Canning's new ministry. 1827.</span> and such
of the Tories as would still serve with him, by the 27th of April a
new Government was formed. The Duke of Clarence, since the death of
the Duke of York (Jan. 5, 1827) heir-presumptive, was made Lord High
Admiral, Copley, made Lord Lyndhurst, became Chancellor, Lord Dudley,
a very able though eccentric man, went to the Foreign Office, Mr.
Robinson became Lord Goderich, and led the party in the Upper House as
Secretary for the Colonies, Sturges-Bourne went to the Home Office, Mr.
Huskisson remaining at the Board of Trade. These first appointments
were however provisional; so also was Canning's own acceptance of the
place of Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new Prime Minister, after the
secession of his colleagues, was received with such marked approbation
by the Whigs, that it was not difficult to see that his coalition with
them would be only a matter of time; and as they would require their
fair share in the administration, it was necessary to keep some of
the high places in hand, or only provisionally filled. As far as the
support of parties in the House went, the union between the Canningites
and the Whigs was accomplished; Brougham, Burdett, and Tierney sat
on the Government side of the house; but, although Lord Lansdowne
had already a seat in the Cabinet, Canning did not live long enough
to complete the fusion of parties in the ministry. After the Easter
holidays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1393" id="Page_1393">[1393]</a></span>
during which the ministry were got together, little business of public
importance was transacted, and the session was spent in a series of
vehement attacks and personalities directed against Canning by his
old friends. The only fact of importance was the failure of the Corn
Bill in the Upper House, which has been already mentioned. In
July, to the relief of all parties&mdash;for the bitter feelings lately excited
had rendered the session an unusually disagreeable one&mdash;Parliament
<span class="sidenote">Death of Canning. Aug. 8, 1827.</span> was
prorogued. On the 8th of the next month Canning died of an illness
caught at the funeral of the Duke of York, and rendered worse by the
effects of the constant attacks to which he had been subjected acting
upon his sensitive nature. Thus was prematurely terminated a change
in the position of parties which, by uniting the moderate Tories and
the Whigs, and placing the united forces under the command of so able
a leader as Canning, seemed full of promise for the constitutional
advance of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character and policy of Canning.</div>

<p>The death of Canning was felt to be a national loss. In spite of
every effort to render his funeral private, vast crowds attended, and
Whigs and Tories joined in doing him honour. It was only the exclusive
clique which, like Chatham, he had broken through which retained its
enmity and regarded him to the end as a renegade adventurer. His title
to greatness can scarcely be questioned. Adorned with the richest gifts
of body and mind, a noble and attractive presence, overflowing wit,
and a majestic eloquence, he showed himself an essentially practical
statesman. On most subjects his views were large and liberal; by
his assistance his friend Huskisson was enabled to launch England
upon a fresh course of commercial prosperity, and by so doing to
alleviate the miseries under which the people were groaning. As a
foreign minister he enabled the country to assume a great place among
nations. Two principles formed the bases of his policy&mdash;peace,
and the greatness of his native country, which he regarded as
indissolubly connected with its national individuality. He thus broke
from the trammels of the Holy Alliance, and set on foot the policy
of non-intervention, which, though its misuse has much destroyed its
credit, is, when the dignity of the country is properly supported, the
true policy to be pursued by a people at once desirous to secure peace
and to allow to other nations the opportunity of working out their own
development, and of securing that national freedom of action which
it claims for itself. There were undoubtedly inconsistencies in his
political views. Like his successor, Peel, he belonged to a transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1394" id="Page_1394">[1394]</a></span>
time, and had a mind capable of growth. Several remnants of his early
political creed hung about him to the last. He was always a firm
opponent to parliamentary reform; while supporting continually the
claims of the Catholics, he would listen to no arguments in favour of
the relaxation of the Test and Corporation Acts; and he always upheld
the repressive measures of Lord Sidmouth. It is to be remembered that
his youth had been passed in the midst of the French Revolution,
against which all the weapons of his wit had been directed, and that
he was the favourite disciple of Pitt at the time when that minister's
energies were chiefly directed to the suppression of revolutionary
and Jacobinical tendencies; while, in his prime, temperate reform
had become so connected with the exaggerated views of the radical
reformers, that it is not to be wondered at that a statesman trained as
Canning had been should object to measures which might open a door to
the admission of so violent a flood of change.</p>

<p>Though its chief was gone, it was determined to continue the
ministry which Canning had formed on the same principle of compromise
on the subject of Catholic reform. The King could not make up his
mind to take any decided step one way or the other, and fixed upon
<span class="sidenote">Goderich's ministry.</span> Lord Goderich, a
colourless man, as best fitted to carry on the system. The changes
necessary were few, but some of them important for the future. Lord
Goderich's own place was taken by Huskisson; Lord Lansdowne accepted,
at the King's personal request, the Home Office; the Chancellorship of
the Exchequer, which Canning had held, was, with some want of wisdom,
considering the connection of the Canningites and Whigs, given to Mr.
Herries, a Tory, an appointment which at once shook the administration.
Another important nomination was that of the Duke of Wellington, who,
immediately upon Canning's death, was without difficulty persuaded to
resume the command of the army, showing how far personal enmity had
been the cause of his previous resignation. The accession of these two
Tories was at the time regarded as a sure augury for the early break
up of the Cabinet. "Before six months are over," said Lord Anglesey,
who had been the agent in securing Wellington's adhesion, "he will
trip up all your heels." These forebodings were speedily fulfilled.
A quarrel broke out about the appointment of a chairman to a Finance
Committee which was to be formed at the opening of the session. The
position naturally belonged to Mr. Herries, but Tierney and Huskisson
appear to have secured the appointment of Lord Althorp without
Mr. Herries' knowledge (Nov. 29). Both Huskisson and Herries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1395" id="Page_1395">[1395]</a></span>
sent in their resignation; it seemed impossible to keep them both, and
Lord Goderich, unable to take a firm course in the matter, sent in his
own resignation, which, after he had once weakly withdrawn it, was
finally accepted (Jan. 8, 1828). After seven months of useless life the
abortive ministry expired.</p>

<p>There was great difficulty in finding a successor for Goderich.
Lord Harrowby declined the position. Huskisson, who was thought
of, was supposed unable to lead the Commons, and the King, weary
of compromise, determined to have recourse to the Tories, and, at the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYEIGHT_WELLINGTONS_MINISTRY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYEIGHT_WELLINGTONS_MINISTRY"></a>Wellington made Prime Minister. Jan. 1828.</span>
advice of Lord Lyndhurst, applied to the Duke of Wellington, whose
supposed firmness of character inspired him with confidence. But even
yet George attempted to postpone the final settlement of the Catholic
question; the conditions he laid on Wellington were only to avoid
a union with Lord Grey and to establish a lasting Government. The
Duke therefore, in spite of his late conduct, asked and received the
adhesion of Dudley, Palmerston, Huskisson, and some others. The Whigs
of the late Government naturally retired, and in their place the Tories
of Lord Liverpool's Government resumed office. In fact the attempt was
made to reconstitute the Liverpool Cabinet. Mr. Huskisson declared to
his constituents at Liverpool that the presence of so many Canningites
was a guarantee that that minister's policy would be continued, but
it was generally understood that the accession of Wellington to the
premiership was in fact a Tory triumph, and such it speedily proved.
In a very few months an opportunity, arising from a slight difference
of opinion, enabled the Duke to insist upon the resignation of Mr.
Huskisson; with him the rest of Canning's party left the ministry, and
the Government was constituted entirely on a Tory basis (May).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of the Turkish question.</div>

<p>The continuation of Canning's policy in some way or other was indeed
almost a necessity, but the way in which his plans were completed by
Wellington would hardly have satisfied Canning. He had died, leaving
unfinished in the hands of his successors one of the most difficult
diplomatic questions which he had undertaken. For six years a war,
marked by extreme barbarity, had been carried on between the Turks and
their Greek subjects. It will be remembered that on this point the
Czar, who regarded himself as the natural protector of the Greeks, and
who nourished the traditional desire of conquest on the side of Turkey,
had found himself at variance with his own principles. His mind was
divided between a wish to seize the opportunity offered of extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1396" id="Page_1396">[1396]</a></span>
his influence over Turkey, and his love of legitimacy, which, as
chief of the Holy Alliance, he constantly upheld, and which seemed to
forbid him to take the part of insurgents against their legitimate
sovereign. Lengthened conferences between the representatives of the
sovereigns of Europe had been held at St. Petersburg, where France
and Austria, bitterly opposed to the English policy, both with regard
to the constitutionalists of Spain, and the acknowledgment of the
independence of the South American colonies, had shown themselves eager
upon the side of legitimacy, and where Austria especially had expressed
a constant wish that the Greeks should be treated merely as insurgents.
Supported therefore by the advice of Austria, and trusting to the
well-known feeling in favour of the Mahomedan rule in Turkey which
existed among the Tories in England, the Porte had refused to listen
to any offers of mediation. Nor did it seem possible that the English
ministry, anxious at once to prevent Russia from attacking Turkey and
yet to save the <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_CANNINGS_DIPLOMACY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYFOUR_CANNINGS_DIPLOMACY"></a>Canning's diplomacy on the
subject.</span> Greeks, could intervene with any hope of honourable
success. At last, in 1824, an opening occurred, and the hope was raised
in Canning's mind that these two apparently contrary objects might be
obtained. The provisional government in Greece in its despair made
a formal appeal to the English, and showed itself quite as fearful
of the warlike views of Russia as Turkey itself, in the belief that
the outbreak of a war with Turkey would ensure its own immediate
destruction. The English minister now thought it possible to bring
the conferences, from which he had hitherto held quite aloof, under
his own hand in London. The course of events tended to assist his
plan. In 1825 the conferences at St. Petersburg broke up without
action, the other powers having refused to join Russia in mediation.
It was the conduct of Metternich, who dreaded before all things any
tampering with the principles of legitimate sovereignty, and constantly
abetted the obstinacy of the Porte, which had rendered the mediation
futile. Thus thwarted in his plans, and feeling that his failure was
due to Metternich, the Czar found a point of union with Canning in
their dislike to the Austrian minister. England was represented at
Constantinople by Sir Stratford Canning, and by his skilful management
the ambassadors of the two courts there began to draw together; and at
last, in November 1825, Canning had a triumphant proof of the success
of his policy and of the importance of England, when all the ministers
of the great powers in London confessed that they saw no way out of
their difficulty but by English intervention. This favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1397" id="Page_1397">[1397]</a></span>
state of things was for the moment crossed by the death of Alexander
(Dec. 1, 1825). The view which his successor Nicholas would take
became in the last degree important; Canning, with great wisdom,
chose Wellington&mdash;opposed indeed to his policy, but personally
acceptable to the Russian Czar&mdash;as his special ambassador to
take the royal congratulations upon the new Emperor's accession, and
to continue the negotiations if possible. The appointment met with
universal approbation; even Metternich believed that in the hands of
Wellington the question must be settled in accordance with his views.
It was with much surprise and anger that the Turks and Austrians heard
that, on the 4th of April, an arrangement had been
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_PROTOCOL_BETWEEN_ENGLAND" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_PROTOCOL_BETWEEN_ENGLAND"></a>Protocol between England and Russia. April
1826.</span> arrived at between the Courts of England and Russia.
Taking advantage of the very moderate claims of the Greeks, who
demanded no more than to be placed on the same footing as the Danubian
Principalities, remaining as self-governing but dependent vassals
of the Turkish Government, the English minister had succeeded in
procuring the signature of a protocol embodying a plan for peaceful
intervention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enthusiasm for Greek independence in
England.</div>

<p>The cause of Greek independence had already excited enthusiasm in
England, many volunteers had joined the armies, and money had been
subscribed for them. In this enthusiasm Canning in his heart fully
joined; from early youth one of his favourite dreams had been the
independence of that race to which as an ardent lover of the classics
he felt he owed so much. But, true to his principles, and determined
to maintain the strict neutrality of England, he had done his best to
check any active assistance to the insurgents. According to his view
it was necessary that England should intervene with clean hands, and
as the friend of both parties. He was also in constant dread of the
watchfulness of his Tory enemies, fearing lest any sign of too great
favour to Russia should enable them entirely to thwart his plans.
Nevertheless the knowledge of the approaching intervention gave a
great impetus to the feeling in favour of Greece in England, and men
and money were poured in considerable quantities into the peninsula.
Lord Cochrane, the most dashing and adventurous of English sailors,
had joined the insurgents with an American frigate, General Churchill
took command of their armies, yet their destruction seemed imminent.
The Egyptians, under Ibrahim Pasha, had come to the assistance of their
enemies; their fleet, which was little better than a body of pirates,
was swept from the sea; Missalonghi was for the third time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1398" id="Page_1398">[1398]</a></span>
taken, and in spite of General Churchill's efforts, Athens and the
Acropolis had fallen. If the protocol was to be of any use the time
for acting upon it had arrived. The allies received a great accession
of strength when, after a visit of Canning to Paris in the spring of
1826, the French Government and the King himself entered heartily into
their plans. It was plain that for the second time Canning had struck a
severe blow at the principles of the Holy Alliance. In April 1827 the
three powers proceeded to act with renewed strength. They demanded
an immediate armistice, pointed out that the war did
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_TURKEY_REFUSES_THE_ARMISTICE" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSEVEN_TURKEY_REFUSES_THE_ARMISTICE"></a>Turkey refuses the armistice demanded by the allies.
April 1827.</span> not seem to be approaching its conclusion, that it
caused interference with the traffic of the world, and that in the
interests of Europe it must cease. Almost of course the Turks, still
trusting to Austria, and still unable to believe in the changed posture
of England, rejected this demand. Therefore, in accordance with the
expressed wish of the French, which no doubt agreed with Canning's own
wishes, the protocol was changed <span class="sidenote">The Treaty of
London consequently signed.</span> into a treaty known as the Treaty
of London, signed on the 6th of July by Lord Dudley, Count Lieven, and
the Prince of Polignac. In strict accordance with the terms of the
protocol, it set forth the necessity of European action, it stated the
terms which must be given to Greece, and which went no further than
establishing its self-government under Turkish supremacy and saddled
with a tribute to the Porte, and declared that none of the parties to
the treaty sought territorial increase or commercial advantages. Fear
of Russian aggrandizement was thus withdrawn, the intervention was at
first to be purely friendly; but secret articles went on to say that,
if the intervention were rejected, more stringent means must be used to
oblige its acceptance both by one party and by the other, and that it
would be necessary to show countenance to Greece, by acknowledging her
as a belligerent power, and establishing consuls at her ports. It was
not expressly stated what the further means of coercion were to be. A
month was given to the Porte for consideration of the terms offered.
If no answer, or an unfavourable answer came, the secret articles were
to be put into execution. If the armistice was refused by the Turks,
the allied squadrons then in the Mediterranean were to unite, to enter
into friendly relations with the Greeks, and to intercept all ships
freighted with men and arms destined to act against the Greeks, whether
from Turkey or from Egypt. At the same time they were carefully to
avoid hostilities. It is doubtful whether Canning could have succeeded
in carrying out this his last measure of peace policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1399" id="Page_1399">[1399]</a></span>
and non-intervention without having recourse to war. When the affair
had reached this point he died, and the completion of his work fell
into weaker and less competent hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt of the allies to compel the
armistice.</div>

<p>In August, a joint note having been again sent, and all satisfactory
answer having been entirely refused by Reis Effendi, the Turkish
minister, consuls were appointed according to the treaty, and the
fleets ordered to compel the armistice. The execution of this delicate
duty was intrusted to Admiral Codrington on the part of the English,
to the French Admiral de Rigny, and to Count Heyden, who commanded
the Russian fleet. Twenty-eight Turkish and Egyptian ships of war lay
in Navarino Bay awaiting fresh reinforcements from Egypt. Had the
union taken place, the combined fleets of Turkey and Egypt would have
entirely destroyed the Greek Government then in the Ionian Islands, and
have swept away what remained of the Greek fleet. The allies appeared
before Navarino, explained to Ibrahim Pasha, who was in command, the
negotiations which were proceeding, and declared that the Turkish
fleet should not sail. Ibrahim, nothing daunted, while asserting that
he would take orders from his own sovereign only, pledged himself, on
the 25th of September, that the fleet should remain quiet for twenty
days to enable him to receive an answer from Constantinople. In spite
of this promise, Codrington, who had withdrawn, heard on the 1st of
October that the fleet had left harbour. He at once went to meet it,
and turned back the first squadron he encountered. On the 13th the
combined fleets were in front of Navarino. Then Ibrahim in anger let
loose his troops on the wretched people, and before the eyes of the
allies terrible scenes of barbarity were enacted. Codrington, though
with difficulty, kept himself in restraint, but on the 20th his fleet
sailed into the harbour, to say that they would convoy the Turkish
ships to Turkey, the Egyptian ships to Egypt. They found the Turks and
Egyptians <span class="sidenote">Battle of Navarino. Oct. 20, 1827.</span>
drawn up in the form of a horseshoe and ready for battle. Strict orders
were given not to fire unless the enemy proceeded to hostilities, and
Codrington, bringing his ship close to that of the Turkish admiral,
opened communications with him. Meanwhile, a boat from the Dartmouth
was fired upon, and a cannon shot was fired against the French
flagship. In spite of this Codrington went on parleying till his pilot
was shot by his side and a broadside fired upon his ship. The battle
then began in earnest, and in four hours the hostile fleet was entirely
destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1400" id="Page_1400">[1400]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Goderich's inaction renders the victory
nugatory.</div>

<p>The news of the victory was received with delight in France and
Russia, and at first with triumph in England, where at the instant
Sir Edward Codrington met with the full approval of
the Government. None the less did it present to the
weak and tottering Cabinet of Lord Goderich difficulties
of the gravest kind. The peaceful policy of their late chief had
ended in a fierce and destructive battle; they hardly knew whether
to accept the whole responsibility of it or not. At all events they
did not follow up the blow or act with any vigour under the circumstances.
The effect of this delay was to strengthen in Constantinople
the belief that the union between the three powers was not hearty,
and to encourage the Turks in their obstinacy. The foreign merchants
in Constantinople were apprehended, the Porte determined on
war, demanding that the allies should refrain entirely from interfering
on the Greek question, pay the fleet, and indemnify the Sultan
for his losses. In spite of the efforts of the ambassadors, before they
had left Constantinople, which they did upon the 8th of December,
nothing could be gained beyond an offer of a general amnesty to the
Greeks. Had the allied fleets proceeded at once to Constantinople,
which was the wish both of Sir Stratford Canning and of Codrington,
it is probable that they might have put an end to the war with
Greece, and have succeeded in carrying out at least one part of the
London Treaty, by saving Turkey from the invasion of Russia, which
now became inevitable. As it was, England had in fact only handed
the country up, weakened by the loss of its fleet, to the hands

1828.</span> of that power. The weakness of the Goderich Government
prevented such efficient action, and the accession of Wellington to
office rendered it still more impossible. True to his Tory traditions,
while pretending to continue the policy of Canning, he fell back
upon the words of the London Treaty, which were no doubt intended to
be pacific. The speech at the opening of Parliament, on the 29th of
January 1828, mentioned the battle of Navarino in somewhat disparaging
terms as "the untoward event," which it was hoped would not be followed
by further hostilities, and the Duke himself declared that the
preservation of the Ottoman Porte as an independent and powerful state
was necessary to the wellbeing of this country. In fact, he suffered
the matter again to fall back into negotiations. England kept out of
war, and Russia was allowed to overrun Turkey, to take Adrianople (Aug.
20, 1828), and from thence to dictate terms which left the Porte for
ten years at least defenceless in their hands. Among the terms demanded
by Russia was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1401" id="Page_1401">[1401]</a></span>
necessarily the independence of Greece. The limits were arranged by
the three powers in London. Neither Turkey nor Greece were allowed a
voice in the matter; the frontiers were fixed, and a monarchical form
of government established; the crown for a while went begging; it was
declined by the Saxon Prince John, and by Prince Leopold (May 1830),
subsequently King of the Belgians, nor was it till the year 1832 that
Otho of Bavaria, a lad of eighteen, was found to undertake a post which
offered almost insuperable difficulties and but very little honour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of Wellington's Government.</div>

<p>The Duke of Wellington had been no doubt first called to the
Premiership for the purpose of continuing as far as possible the system
of the Tories. His conduct as head of the Government was so peculiar
that it would scarcely have been tolerated in a less influential
man. He regarded his office as he would have regarded a military
command,&mdash;a trust not lightly to be laid down. He fought till his
opponents became irresistible and then suddenly retreated, without
thinking it necessary to resign office on account of his defeat. This
view of his duty had the same practical results as the most determined
place-hunting, and reduced his Government to that most dangerous form
of weakness which consists in driving opposition to irresistible
extremes, and then suddenly yielding to pressure. This peculiar
tendency to give up his opinion and yet retain office was visible at
the very outset. He had taken the Premiership, although a few months
before he had declared himself wholly unfit for it; he had formed a
mixed Government, though his views and <span class="sidenote">Repeal
of the Test and Corporation Acts. May 1828.</span> those of the King
were in favour of a united one. His next concession was upon the repeal
of the Test and Corporation Acts. In the first session of 1828, Lord
John Russell moved for a Committee upon those Acts. Canning had always
withstood their repeal; the Duke and Mr. Peel were known to share the
late minister's opinion. But when a majority of forty-four in a full
House decided in favour of Lord John Russell's Committee, the leaders
of the Government accepted their decision, and declared themselves
satisfied with the substitution of a declaration that the incoming
office-holder would do nothing to injure the Church, instead of the old
sacramental test. After a lengthened and bitter opposition, led by Lord
Eldon in the Upper House, the Bill was carried. The old Chancellor's
view of the conduct of Government was very unfavourable. "They began in
the Commons," he said, "by opposition, and then ran away like a parcel
of cowards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1402" id="Page_1402">[1402]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Corn Bill passed.</div>

<p>The second important Bill of the session was the Corn Bill, to be
substituted for that which Wellington had himself succeeded in throwing
out in the preceding session. Here again he yielded to circumstances.
Entirely leaving his previous standing-ground, the Premier now
supported the Bill on exactly the same principle of duties on a
graduated scale as that he had previously thwarted. The fixed point in
the scale was a few shillings higher, but in principle the Bill was
identical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resignation of Huskisson and his friends. May
1828.</div>

<p>No doubt the necessity for such concessions was very irksome to
the Duke, and, as before mentioned, an opportunity soon occurred for
ridding himself of the more liberal members of his Cabinet, whose
pressure he had been unable to resist. On a trivial question as to the
disposition of the seats of two disfranchised boroughs Huskisson had
thought it his duty to vote against his colleagues. It had been before
settled that the question should not be a Cabinet one; but Huskisson,
while still under excitement, thought it right to send the Duke a
letter offering to retire should the Premier wish it. The Duke seized
his opportunity, treated the letter as an absolute resignation, would
listen to no explanation, and obliged Huskisson to resign. With him
went Palmerston, Dudley, Lamb, and Grant; their places were filled with
Tories, and the Government seemed at length thoroughly homogeneous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Catholic Emancipation question.</div>

<p>Yet the establishment of this Tory Cabinet was followed almost
immediately by a far greater concession than any of the preceding ones,
in the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Bill. The Government had
been constituted as far as possible on a Protestant basis. It was known
that the King was strong in his anti-Catholic propensities. Although
a small majority in the Commons had, on the 8th of May, declared in
favour of bringing the question to a settlement, and although both
the Chancellor and the Prime Minister had confessed, while opposing
the motion successfully in the Lords, that they saw no way at present
out of the great difficulty, thereby apparently implying a wish for a
settlement, the declarations both of Wellington and of Peel gave little
hope of any relaxation of the disabilities. But meanwhile events were
occurring which rendered some settlement obviously necessary. There
was indeed a general and growing feeling that a question which in the
last thirty-five years had ruined more than one Cabinet, which was in
fact uppermost in all men's minds at the time of every new ministerial
arrangement, and which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1403" id="Page_1403">[1403]</a></span>
kept Ireland permanently uneasy, could no longer be left uncertain.
Events were now occurring in Ireland which would have rendered the
further postponement of the settlement little short of madness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewed agitation in Ireland.</div>

<p>The agitation in that country, which had almost subsided during
the administration of Canning, a well-known supporter of the Catholic
claims, and which had only slightly revived during Goderich's
administration, broke out again in full force when the hostile
ministry of Wellington came into office. The law for the suppression
of the Association would expire in the coming July, and meanwhile,
keeping within the limits of the law, for all practical purposes the
organization remained alive. The last general election had opened the
eyes of the leaders of the Association to a new and irresistible source
of power; it had proved that the power of the priests was in some cases
stronger than that of the landlords. In their eagerness to secure their
parliamentary influence, the landlords had followed the disastrous
plan of breaking up their estates into small forty shilling freeholds,
taking advantage of the low franchise which existed in Ireland.
Several instances had occurred in which the tenantry had broken loose
from their landlords, and at Waterford, among other places, they had
proved themselves too strong even for the great Beresford interest.
What had then been done in a few instances it was the intention of the
Association to carry out in a large scale, and great efforts were made
to secure the votes of those who were known as the Irish "forties"
in the coming general election. The anger of the proprietors thus
assaulted in their strongholds was very great, and class animosity
reached a terrible pitch. The power of the Association was soon brought
to the test. With the rest of the Canningites, Grant, President of the
Board of Trade, had resigned; his place had been given to Mr. Vesey
Fitzgerald, member for Clare, whose re-election thus became necessary.
Aware that, even if they succeeded in excluding the Government
candidate, the election of a Protestant representative would be of no
great value to them, the Association determined to strike a great blow,
<span class="sidenote">Election of O'Connell for Clare. June 1828.</span>
and to bring forward O'Connell himself to dispute Mr. Fitzgerald's
seat. His triumph was complete; after a few days' polling Mr.
Fitzgerald withdrew. But more wonderful and more terrible than his
mere success was the admirable discipline and order with which it was
obtained. Lord Palmerston thus narrates the event:&mdash;"The event was
dramatic and somewhat sublime. The Prime Minister of England tells the
Catholics in his speech in the House of Lords that if they will only be
perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1404" id="Page_1404">[1404]</a></span>
quiet for a few years, cease to urge their claims, and let people
forget the question entirely, then after a few years perhaps something
may be done for them. They reply to this advice, within a few weeks
after it is given, by raising the population of a whole province like
one man, keeping them within the strictest obedience to the law, and
by strictly legal and constitutional means hurling from his seat in
the representation one of the Cabinet ministers of the King. There
were 30,000 Irish peasants in and about Ennis in sultry July, and not
a drunken man among them, or only one, and he an Englishman and a
Protestant, O'Connell's own coachman, whom O'Connell had committed upon
his own deposition for a breach of the peace. No Irishman ever stirs
a mile from his house without a stick, but not a stick was to be seen
at the election. One hundred and forty priests were brought from other
places to harangue the people from morning to night, and to go round to
the several parishes to exhort and bring up voters.... All passed off
quietly. The population of the adjoining counties was on the move, and
large bodies had actually advanced in echelon, as it were, closing in
upon Ennis, the people of one village going on to the next, and those
of that next advancing to a nearer station, and so on." The sheriff and
his assessor declared that the election was legal, the only obstacle
to O'Connell's appearance in the House being the oaths he would have
to take on his admittance. It was determined to follow up the success.
O'Connell declared that Catholic representatives must be elected for
all the counties of Ireland. The funds of the Association, which
assumed its old form in July on the expiration of the suppression law,
were partially devoted to the support of those on whom the vengeance of
the landlords fell; and not content with declaring the necessity of the
election of Catholic members, the Association drew up certain pledges
to be required of all future Catholic candidates. These consisted in a
promise to be the determined opponents of the ministry of Wellington
and Peel till it granted Catholic emancipation, to support religious
and civil liberty, to procure a repeal of the Subletting Act (which
was an attempt to restrain the minute subdivision of property), and to
support a reform of Parliament.</p>

<p>The power the Association had already exhibited, and its
determination to have those representatives whom it should elect thus
closely bound to pursue the line of conduct it dictated, much increased
the <span class="sidenote">Influence of the Association.</span> dread
with which it was regarded. Symptoms were already visible of the
influence it might exert; only ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1405" id="Page_1405">[1405]</a></span>
days after the establishment of the pledges (Aug. 2), Mr. Dawson,
Peel's brother-in-law, and himself in the Administration, after a
lively picture of the enormous power of the Association, concluded with
the unexpected assertion, that as this power could not be crushed it
ought to be conciliated. Coming from such a source the assertion was
received as a certain proof that the cause of the Catholics was winning
its way. Consequently the efforts of the Association were pressed
forward with redoubled zeal. Parochial clubs were established, and
great aggregate meetings held in various parts of Ireland. Mr. Shiel,
one of its most ardent supporters, thus describes the condition of
Ireland under its influence:&mdash;"Does not a tremendous organization
extend over the whole island? Have not all the natural bonds by which
men are tied together been broken and burst asunder? Are not all the
relations of society which exist elsewhere gone? Has not property
lost its influence? Has not rank been stripped of the respect which
should belong to it? Has not an internal government grown up, which,
gradually superseding the legitimate authorities, has armed itself
with a complete domination? Is it nothing that the whole body of the
clergy are alienated from the State, and that the Catholic gentry and
peasantry and priesthood are all combined in one vast confederacy?" His
description was true; the Association was omnipotent, and in nothing
did it show its power so much as in the complete restraint it held over
the excitable people. Faction and faction fights disappeared; crime
of a graver sort almost vanished; and though the people were drilled
and brought into something resembling military organization, although
they were eager to know against whom they were to fight, the influence
of the Association restrained them from all demonstrations likely to
provoke hostilities, and on one occasion a few words from O'Connell at
once broke up and dispersed a body of 50,000 men. This was the more
admirable as the temper of the Protestants had naturally been roused,
and Brunswick clubs had sprung up, to take the place of the Orange
organization, which do not seem to have been as self-restrained as the
Catholics. During the whole of this time the Duke was painfully making
up his mind to his retreat. The peculiarity of his action was that he
became absolutely silent; so complete was his silence, that Mr. Shiel
thus describes the situation:&mdash;"The minister folds his arms as if
he were a mere indifferent observer, and the terrific contest between
Protestant and Catholic only afforded him a spectacle for the amusement
of his official leisure; he sits as if two gladiators were crossing
their swords for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1406" id="Page_1406">[1406]</a></span>
his gratification: the Cabinet seems to be little better than a box
in a theatre from which his Majesty's ministers may survey the
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYNINE_RESIGNATION_OF_LORD_ANGLESEY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYNINE_RESIGNATION_OF_LORD_ANGLESEY"></a>Resignation of Lord Anglesey. Jan. 1829.</span>
business of blood." Indeed, so strangely reticent was the Duke, that
he ceased to correspond at all with his Lord Lieutenant, the Marquis
of Anglesey. Uninstructed from home, Lord Anglesey, who was a Liberal,
and inclined to the emancipation, naturally followed the dictates
of his own opinions, and rendered the conduct of the Government
almost treacherous from the indirect support he gave to the Liberals,
while his chief in London was supporting the opposite party. The
inevitable consequence was that he shortly committed an indiscretion
which necessitated his recall. His place was taken by the Duke of
Northumberland, a strong Tory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peel and Wellington see the urgency of the
Catholic question.</div>

<p>Peel, the most influential member of the ministry next to the
Premier, had already, since the Clare election, arrived at the
conclusion that the solution of the question could no longer be
postponed, and that only one form of solution was possible. The
election of Catholics, while still unable to sit in Parliament, would
deprive Ireland of its representation. So important an event as
O'Connell's election could not possibly pass unnoticed and the question
be left unmoved. With the present House a high-handed repression of the
Association was impossible; were it attempted by a new House a civil
war was inevitable: there remained but a third course&mdash;to give
way. Early in August 1828, Peel had stated this opinion forcibly to the
Duke, and told him that he considered that an attempt to settle the
Catholic question was a lesser evil than to continue to leave it open;
at the same time he wished himself to resign, and to leave the bringing
in of the measure to other hands. Although aware of the penalty he
should be called upon to pay for this change of opinion, the attacks
to which he should be subject, and the loss of friends, he was at
length persuaded by Wellington, who felt it impossible to carry on the
Government without him, to retain his place. Peel's representations had
had their effect upon the Duke's mind, and he was by degrees becoming
convinced that further obstruction was impossible. During the autumn he
learned to see that his choice lay between the reconquest of Ireland,
the repeal of the Union, or the emancipation of the Catholics. He could
not hesitate which of the three to choose. But though his own mind and
that of his colleague were made up, great difficulties lay in the way
of the execution of their plans, the chief of which was the temper of
the King, who had now begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1407" id="Page_1407">[1407]</a></span>
declare that he, like his father, was troubled with conscientious
scruples. At length, in January, the King consented that the question
should be brought before the Cabinet. The two ministers found little
or no opposition, and it was determined to take in hand the final
settlement of the question. Accordingly, in the royal speech at the
opening of Parliament (Feb. 5), it was stated that measures must first
of all be taken to establish authority by the destruction of the
Association, and that then the whole condition of Ireland should be
taken into consideration, with a view to altering the laws so as to
remove civil disabilities from his Majesty's Catholic subjects. The
speech came as an unexpected blow to the high Tories, but immediate
discussion was postponed at the request of the ministry till the
actual Bill could be introduced in its completed form. Meanwhile the
preliminary measure for the destruction of the Association was brought
in. Its necessity was however forestalled by the clever tactics of
the Irish, who dissolved their Association before the Bill obtained
the force of law. Having declared his change of opinion, Peel, who
throughout acted as honourably as circumstances would allow, thought
it incumbent on him to resign his seat for Oxford, which he no doubt
owed chiefly to his supposed anti-Catholic views. The events of the
election proved that he was right, the seat was contested by Sir Robert
Inglis, who was elected by a considerable majority. Peel found a seat
at Westbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of the King.</div>

<p>The coast seemed now clear for the great measure, but the King made
a final stand. The very day before the Bill was to be introduced (March
4), he sent unexpectedly for Wellington, Lyndhurst, and Peel, declared
he had been misunderstood, withdrew his sanction, and asked what they
now intended to do about Ireland. In fact he had been incessantly
worked on by the Tory Lords who had access to him; and, weak and
miserable, apparently thought that the fear of offending him might even
yet postpone the measure. Peel at once declared that nothing remained
for him but to resign. The Duke and the Chancellor expressed the same
intention, and they left the presence of the King, who bade them a most
friendly farewell, in the belief that the ministry was at an end. Late
at night Wellington received a letter, in which the King said that
he was convinced of the impossibility of forming another ministry,
and begged them to remain. Knowing his weak character, it was only on
receiving express leave to declare that the measure was brought in with
his consent that they agreed to remain, and it was with the assertion
that he was acting in full accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1408" id="Page_1408">[1408]</a></span>
with the King's wishes that Peel began his speech. The proposed Bill
<span class="sidenote">Introduction of the Bill. March 5, 1829.</span>
was of a sweeping but simple character. It substituted a new form
of oath for the old oaths of supremacy, allegiance, and abjuration;
thus, if a Catholic bound himself to support the State and not
injure the Church, he could sit in either House of Parliament, had
a perfect equality with his Protestant neighbours, and was eligible
for all offices, civil, military, or municipal, with the exception of
the office of Regent, of Lord Chancellor, of Viceroy of Ireland, or
royal commissioner of the General Assembly of Scotland. From offices
connected with the Church, or participation in Church patronage, he
was naturally excluded. The second point of the Bill was the position
to be occupied by the Roman Church. It was to be left as a dissenting
community, unendowed and unrestricted, but the use of episcopal titles,
the increase of monks, and the introduction of more Jesuits, were
forbidden. This Bill for the remission of all restrictions was to be
coupled with another for the establishment of certain securities, the
chief of which consisted in the raising of the franchise to £10. In a
long and careful speech Peel explained his views, and vindicated his
change of policy. The same course was pursued by Wellington in the
Upper House, where he alleged that the chief grounds for his present
conduct was his horror of civil war, which he regarded as inevitable.
"I am one of those who have probably passed a longer period of my
life engaged in war than most men, and principally, I may say, in
civil war, and I must say this, that if I could avoid by any sacrifice
whatever even one month of civil war in the country to which I am
attached, I would sacrifice my life in order to do it. There is nothing
which disturbs property and wellbeing so much, which so deteriorates
character as civil war, and that, my Lords, would have been the event
to which we must have looked, that the means to which we must have had
recourse." As was natural, there was a strong opposition, but in both
Houses Canningites, Whigs, and Ministerialists combined to swell the
majority; on the first reading it numbered 188, on the second 180. Not
one amendment was carried in Committee, and the Bill finally passed by
a majority of 178 in a House of 452. In the <span class="sidenote">The
Bill passed. April 1829.</span> House of Lords it was as favourably
received, and on the 10th of April it was passed on the third reading
by 213 to 209. There was yet one more struggle, in which the King
played a pitiful part. Lord Eldon relates two interviews he had with
him, in which George seemed inclined to deny that he had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1409" id="Page_1409">[1409]</a></span>
authorized his ministers to bring in the Bill, and to represent himself
as forced to consent by repeated threats of resignation. Lord Eldon
was honest enough to say, after he had seen written evidence of the
fact, that the King's consent had been given, and that it could not
now be withdrawn, and the interview closed in the midst of petulant
and childish exclamations of anger on the part of the King. Lord Eldon
probably hoped that in spite of what he had said there might be still
some delay, but the royal assent was at once given, and the Bill became
law on the 14th of April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O'Connell agitates for the repeal of the
Union.</div>

<p>The Bill for the disfranchisement of the forty shilling freeholders
passed at the same time as the Catholic Emancipation Bill, and received
the royal assent with it. The conduct of O'Connell, who quietly allowed
the passing of this Bill, caused much surprise. "The forties" had
been his best supporters, he had pledged himself in the strongest
language to support their claims, but he quietly allowed them to be
disfranchised. It was strange how little commotion so sweeping a
measure produced. A few of the more advanced reformers of England
regarded it as an enormous price paid for a still greater advantage.
But in fact the quarrel had been rapidly assuming the form of a
division of races, and the English Catholics, without whom the measure
could not have been carried, were far more anxious for the equality of
their Church than for the enlargement of Irish liberty. To O'Connell
the question assumed a different shape. Although he repeatedly declared
that the passing of the Bill would quiet Ireland, he by no means
intended that such should be the case. With him the question was far
more Irish than Catholic, as was soon made evident by his conduct. He
presented himself to take his seat in Parliament (May 15), and offered
to take the new oath, but as he had been elected while the old law was
in force, it was held that he was still under its requirements. With
excellent temper and ability he argued his case, which was however
given against him, and a new writ for Clare was issued. His return
was unopposed (July 30), yet he allowed himself the utmost freedom
of language, abused with all the powers of his invective the English
Government, and gave it clearly to be understood that he meant to
continue the struggle till it should end in the repeal of the Union.
These preliminary operations took so much time that it was not till the
next session that he could take his seat. From this time onwards it is
impossible to regard him as the champion of a good cause; he sank into
the position of a demagogue, exciting the people for an impracticable
object, which he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1410" id="Page_1410">[1410]</a></span>
known no English statesman or English Parliament could possibly
grant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington's foreign policy.</div>

<p>The interest of this Catholic Bill had been so absorbing that little
else had been thought of, but when that obstacle was once cleared away,
there was room to consider what was equally important, the foreign
policy of the Government, in which there was much to excite the anger
of the Liberal party, and to raise a belief that where Wellington could
act without pressure his sympathies were in accordance with the system
of Castlereagh rather than with that of Canning. While holding strictly
to the principle of non-intervention, he appeared to use it so as to
throw its advantages almost entirely upon the side of arbitrary power.
It was the affairs of Portugal, of Greece, and of France which chiefly
required his attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_AFFAIRS_OF_PORTUGAL" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_AFFAIRS_OF_PORTUGAL"></a>Affairs of Portugal.</div>

<p>John VI. had at length come back from South America to attempt to
establish his power in Portugal in 1821. During his absence Brazil
declared itself independent, and put Don Pedro, John's son, upon the
throne with the title of Emperor. On the death of John in 1826, Don
Pedro was called to the throne of Portugal also. He had to choose
between his South American and his European dominions. He preferred to
remain in Brazil. He therefore gave a constitution to his Portuguese
subjects, and then abdicated in favour of his young daughter Maria.
For a while his sister acted as Regent, but in February 1828 Don Pedro
thought it better to quiet his ambitious brother Miguel by appointing
him Regent, and guardian of his niece, to whom he was to be ultimately
married. Miguel always declared his intention, as was of course his
duty, to uphold the constitution, which had been supported by English
troops sent, it will be remembered, by orders of Canning, but had
been opposed by a strong party of absolutists, and had not produced
any marked improvement in the condition of the country. The priests,
the nobility, and the soldiery were deeply infected with dislike to
the constitution. In January 1828, just after Wellington had assumed
the reins of power, Miguel had visited England for the purpose, it
was understood, of studying the working of the constitution, and had
voluntarily declared that if he violated the constitution in his own
country he should be a perjured usurper. After some delay he accepted
the constitutional oath, but with circumstances which made it doubtful
even then whether he intended to keep it. So obvious were the signs of
his intention to usurp the throne, that when Wellington determined to
recall the English troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1411" id="Page_1411">[1411]</a></span>
as though their duty was now completed, the English ambassador on
his own authority retained them. Their retention was but temporary.
On the 2nd of April they were recalled, although the Chamber of
Deputies had been suddenly dissolved in the middle of March; for
Wellington, clinging to the narrowest interpretation of the principle
of non-intervention, held that the troops were sent to guard Portugal
against foreign invasion, and not to be used in party quarrels. Their
departure was almost immediately followed by open riots in favour of
the absolutists. Restrained for a short time by the threat that all the
ambassadors would leave his Court, on the 3rd of May Miguel
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYEIGHT_MIGUEL_USURPS_THE_THRONE" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYEIGHT_MIGUEL_USURPS_THE_THRONE"></a>Miguel usurps the throne. May 1828.</span>
began to throw away disguise. He summoned the three ancient estates
of the realm instead of the new constitutional Parliament, and signed
the decree as King Miguel I. This act of usurpation was followed by
the withdrawal of all the ministers except those of Spain and Rome. A
violent reaction set in, the uneducated masses, the aristocracy, and
the clergy had it all their own way, and raised a general cry against
the Freemasons, as they were pleased to call the Liberal party. While
Miguel was planning his usurpation of the throne the act of abdication
on the part of Don Pedro was finally completed, and the young Queen
set sail for Europe. She was at first intended to visit her uncle
the Emperor of Austria; but the <span class="sidenote">Queen Maria
acknowledged in England. Sept. 1828.</span> news of what had happened
in Portugal induced her guardians to bring her to England, where she
was received with all the honour due to a queen both by the ministers
Wellington and Aberdeen, and by King George himself. Meanwhile the
government of the reactionists in Portugal had been marked by much
violence and contempt of law. In the beginning of October, in the
prisons of Lisbon alone, there were 2400 prisoners, of whom 1600 were
confined for political crimes. The total number of prisoners throughout
the kingdom amounted to upwards of 15,000, among whom were forty-two
members of the Chamber of Peers and seven members of the Chamber of
Deputies; and so unrestrained was the wickedness of Miguel that he even
attempted the life of his sister, the late Regent, because she refused
to give up to him some of her jewels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYNINE_WELLINGS_NEUTRALITY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYNINE_WELLINGS_NEUTRALITY"></a>Wellington's adherence to the principle of
neutrality.</div>

<p>The withdrawal of the troops from Lisbon on the one hand, and the
recall of the English minister and the acknowledgment of the young
Queen on the other, appeared to be in accordance with the strictest
rules of neutrality. At the same time it was obvious that that
neutrality as yet had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1412" id="Page_1412">[1412]</a></span>
entirely in favour of Don Miguel. The principle had yet to be put to
harder trials; a number of Portuguese refugees of the constitutional
party were assembled in England, headed by the Marquis Palmella, the
Portuguese ambassador, and General Saldanha, late constitutional War
Minister. Besides their continental dominions, the Portuguese possessed
the islands of the Azores; and although the islands had declared for
Donna Maria, and therefore might be supposed to be under the protection
of the English, Miguel had been allowed to capture Madeira, and had
attempted, though unsuccessfully, a similar attack upon Terceira. In
expectation of a repetition of this effort, application was made to
the Portuguese in England for assistance. A body of between 3000 and
4000 men, the relics of an insurgent army which had attempted in vain
to prevent Miguel's usurpation, had been kept together at Plymouth,
but the representations of the usurper had been listened to, and the
Duke had ordered that they should be distributed throughout England.
Rather than submit to this, Palmella proposed to send them to Brazil;
but Wellington, mistrusting their intentions when once they had left
England, declared his intention of placing them under the escort
of the English fleet. On receiving the application from Terceira,
Palmella, seeing an opportunity for employing his countrymen usefully,
determined to send them thither, but unarmed, to avoid any breach of
the neutrality of England; and, in spite of the avowed intention of
Wellington to prevent this step by force, in the beginning of January
1829 the expedition actually sailed under Saldanha. Some English
frigates were sent to prevent a landing, and fired upon the leading
vessel. Saldanha then retired to Brest. Thus in the eyes of the
Liberals not only had the Duke been impartial, but he had fired upon
an expedition fitted out in favour of a sovereign acknowledged by and
at peace with England, and who intended to make good her possession
of an island of which she was at the moment actually Queen. Such an
interpretation of the duties of neutrality, especially considering the
bitter tyranny under which Portugal was groaning, afforded good grounds
for the anger of the English Liberal party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-intervention in the affairs of Greece.</div>

<p>In the affairs of Greece the same determination under no
circumstances to draw the sword was obvious. While the French sent
an army to the Morea and rescued the peninsula from the Turks, and
while Russia pursued her victorious course towards Constantinople, the
English clung tenaciously to the peaceful side of the Treaty of London.
Their negotiations were so far successful that Russia consented not to
act as a belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1413" id="Page_1413">[1413]</a></span>
in the Mediterranean, but the power of Turkey was none the less
annihilated from the north. Meanwhile Wellington seemed chiefly bent
in restraining the French from advancing beyond the Morea, and in
curtailing as far as possible the limits which the powers intended
ultimately to fix for the new kingdom of Greece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Revolution in France.</div>



<p>In respect to France the effect of the sympathies of the English
Government were perhaps rather fancied than real. The reactionary
tendencies of Charles X.'s minister, M. de Villèle, and the contest in
which he had engaged with the press had excited so much discontent,
that the ministry had been compelled to resign in January 1827. There
were in France three parties, the moderate royalists, of which Villèle
was nominally representative, the ultra-royalists, and the liberals. On
Villèle's retirement a colourless and inefficient ministry was called
to office, and found itself opposed by a coalition between the liberals
and the ultras. At the beginning <span class="sidenote">Supposed
influence of Wellington in Polignac's appointment.</span> of 1829 the
most important and able of the ministers, De Peyronnet, retired. It
was supposed that his resignation would break up the ministry, unless
it was much strengthened by the admission of some new element; the
arrival from London of Prince Polignac, a friend of Wellington and a
strong royalist, was thought to mean that the English minister was
using his influence to insist that the required strength should be
derived from the introduction of a strong royalist element, and that an
attempt should be made to rule France upon more strictly monarchical
principles. The ministry however for the moment continued unchanged,
but found itself in a complete minority in the Chamber of Deputies, and
was defeated in an attempt to reform the departmental and municipal
governments. Its plan ostensibly aimed at reducing the power of the
prefects, who were government nominees, by the establishment of
municipal councils, but in fact it secured the ascendancy of the more
aristocratic part of the nation in the local government by rendering
a high qualification necessary for the electors to these councils. So
obviously inefficient had the ministry proved itself to carry on the
business of the state, that immediately on the close of the session
it was dismissed. But the King had no idea of replacing it by a more
liberal Cabinet; his thoughts turned rather towards repression,
and he summoned the ultra-royalists to his ministry. While the new
appointments were received with absolute distrust and dislike in
France, they met with nothing but praise from the London journals; so
clear did the connection between the Cabinets of the two countries
appear, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1414" id="Page_1414">[1414]</a></span>
the nickname of the Wellington Ministry was given to Polignac's
administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing opposition to the French
ministry.</div>

<p>It was a time of much depression both in trade and agriculture,
and general discontent became prevalent. The mistrust with which the
ministry was regarded was strengthened by the repeated and not always
successful press prosecutions which were undertaken. It was even feared
that, as the Chamber of Deputies was certainly hostile to the ministry,
some attempt would be made to set aside the charter and to obtain a
more favourable Chamber by unconstitutional means. But things had not
yet reached that pass. The old Chamber was quietly opened on the 2nd
of March with a speech in which the King, in the usual language of a
constitutional ruler intending to have recourse to unconstitutional
means of repression, after expatiating on the excellent condition of
the country, went on to assert that if obstacles to the Government
should arise, which he as yet did not foresee, he should find strength
to overcome them in the loyalty of his people. The covert threat was
not lost upon his audience; the address moved in the Lower House
expressed the prevailing mistrust. Concurrence between the sovereign
and the interests of his people was, it declared, the necessary
condition for the good working of the charter; that sympathy was now
broken, the administration had acted, and was continuing to act, as
though the people were disaffected. The King was intreated to choose
between his faithful Parliament and these evil counsellors. Charles
did not refuse to receive the address, but stated in reply to it, that
though grieved to hear that sympathy between himself and his people no
longer existed, he had no intention of receding from his former view.
The next day the Chamber was summarily prorogued, the first instance
since the restoration of so strong a measure, and in May dissolved, a
new Parliament being summoned for August. The elections went constantly
against the Government, in spite of an attempt to rouse the love of
glory in the people by an expedition to Algiers, and of a personal
address by the King, who begged the electors to rally round him for the
support of the royal prerogative. "It is your King who requires this
of you, it is as a father he summons you, do your duty and I will do
mine," were his closing words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unconstitutional conduct of the French
ministry.</div>

<p>Their ill success in the elections reduced the ministers to a
dilemma. They must either resign or again meet a hostile Parliament,
or (a third alternative) proceed in some unconstitutional way. To all
outward appearance they intended to pursue the second course, and the
deputies actually set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1415" id="Page_1415">[1415]</a></span>
out on their journey towards Paris. Polignac and his friends had hoped
to purchase leave to carry on the Government in their own way by
introducing a popular budget, while the eyes of the people were dazzled
by the military successes in Algiers. Finding this out of the question,
at the last hour they determined upon an unconstitutional act. On the
21st of July, three ordinances were introduced to the Council, with an
explanatory memorial. This memorial declared that the charter contained
no promise of protection to the periodical press, and that the
periodical press had been injurious, especially to the military affairs
in Algiers, and that it must therefore be suppressed; while the highest
duty of Government (its own preservation) authorized the setting aside
of the charter, when all efforts to secure a favourable house had been
exhausted in vain. The three ordinances suspended the liberty of the
periodical press, dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, and altered, to
suit the views of the Court, the structure of the chamber hereafter to
be chosen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outbreak of the Revolution.</div>

<p>The ordinances were kept a profound secret, and were given to
the <i>Moniteur</i> to publish at midnight on the 25th of July. Their
effect was an immediate outbreak, headed by the opposition newspaper
editors. A protest, signed by forty-four of them, was issued on
the 26th, declaring that the Government had forfeited its right to
obedience. There was a panic on the Exchange, and all things promised
a revolution, the success of which could scarcely be doubtful, as the
army was deeply infected with disaffection, and there were not more
than 6000 trustworthy troops, under the command of Marmont, himself
inclined to constitutional views. However, the ministry seem to have
persuaded themselves that the effervescence was temporary, and on
the 27th an attempt was made to suppress the protest of the press;
the printing offices were closed, and while the police hammered at
the doors unaided by the lookers-on, the papers were distributed by
thousands from the upper windows. The case even came before one of
the courts of law, as one of the printers was sued for breach of
contract for refusing to print; the Tribunal of Commerce declared
that the ordinance, being against the charter, could not be binding.
So highly-strung a state of public feeling could not last long. Some
deputies had assembled to discuss how they should act; the electors
of Paris sent to them, and begged them to assume the command of the
movement, asserting that the insurrection was already begun, the
armourers' shops had been cleared, and that other signs of immediate
revolution were visible. The deputies postponed their reply till the
following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1416" id="Page_1416">[1416]</a></span>
morning; by that time the people had taken the law into their own
hands. On all sides barricades were being rapidly thrown up; the
Hôtel de Ville was seized, the tricolour flag hoisted, and the tocsin
rang, while the troops were distributed in various parts of the town.
Marmont, who knew the temper of the army, despatched a messenger to
the King at St. Cloud to urge upon him the necessity of concession.
The ministry was in permanent session in the Tuileries, and a state
of siege having been declared, Marmont became head of the Government.
With him the populace tried to treat. Himself inclined to peace,
he could only answer that his orders were to use force. He however
offered to send another messenger to St. Cloud; the reply brought
was to concentrate his forces, and to act with masses. The answer,
which implied the suppression of the revolt at all hazards, was quite
useless&mdash;the soldiers had rapidly deserted; those who kept to
their allegiance had not been supplied with food, and weary and
dispirited, were gradually withdrawn. The uproar continued all night,
and fresh barricades were hourly springing up. On the 29th the same
scenes continued, the troops constantly fraternizing more and more with
the mob, and in the afternoon Marmont found himself obliged to march
with all the <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_ABDICATION_OF_CHARLES_X" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_ABDICATION_OF_CHARLES_X"></a>Abdication of Charles X.</span>
troops he could collect to St. Cloud to secure the safety of the King.
It seems that up to that evening Charles and his courtiers still
believed that they had only an émeute to encounter, but the next day,
as no good news arrived, the King found himself gradually deserted,
and at three in the morning of the last day of July himself drove off.
When he heard that Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, had accepted the
post of Lieutenant of the kingdom, he made a final effort to save his
dynasty by abdicating in favour of his grandson, the Duke of Berri. The
step was entirely fruitless; he was recommended to withdraw quietly.
He took the advice, repaired to Cherbourg, and arrived at Spithead on
the 17th of August. After some residence at Lulworth, Charles accepted
the hospitality of the English King, who had offered him the use of
Holyrood House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of George IV.</div>

<p>In the midst of this revolution, George IV., who had for some years
been seriously ill, and who since the trial of his wife had withdrawn
himself much from public observation, died. His danger had been hidden
from the people, probably at his own request. But on the 26th of June
he died, a victim to a complication of diseases which had rendered his
later years miserable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1417" id="Page_1417">[1417]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Review of Wellington's administration.</div>

<p>Throughout the last session of the reign Wellington had occupied a
position which could not long be maintained. There was no doubt that
an earnest effort might immediately have driven his administration
from office. He had broken with the old high Tories by the Catholic
Emancipation and by his financial policy. He had quarrelled with the
Canningites by insisting upon the resignation of Huskisson. He had
indeed made <span class="sidenote">His isolated position.</span> some
approaches towards the Whigs, and admitted both Scarlet and Lord
Roslin to office, but his views rendered it impossible that any real
union with them should be thought of. He thus stood absolutely alone,
allowed to remain in office chiefly because men thought him the only
minister fit to deal with the vacillating and unprincipled King, and
because a speedy change on George's death was expected. Consequently
the session was passed in somewhat meaningless discussions, and
in attacks to which the arbitrary and self-confident character of
Wellington laid him open. Though the settlement of Greece was finally
completed, his foreign policy, as we have seen, which seemed to aim
at little else than at keeping things exactly as they were, met with
little approbation. Attacks against the press in which he engaged
seemed at once somewhat to lower his dignity, and to give openings
for the assaults of the Liberals. His financial measures, although he
effected a saving of upwards of a million in the payment of the Civil
Service, diminished but little the weight of taxation, while continued
disturbances in Ireland, and widespread discontent and misery among the
working-classes, especially in the silk trade, threw gloom over all the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_CHARACTER_OF_THE_KING" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_CHARACTER_OF_THE_KING"></a>Character of William IV.</div>

<p><span class="first drop">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was perhaps fortunate that George IV. was succeeded by a man
of very different character, whose simplicity and geniality speedily
made him as popular as his brother had been the reverse. The little
care with which he preserved the outward forms of dignity shocked the
older Tories; the freedom with which he admitted men of both parties
to his table and his Court seemed to promise a reign conducted on
constitutional principles and without party bias on the part of the
Crown. The popularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1419" id="Page_1419">[1419]</a></span>
of the King was at the time of great importance, because the excitement
of the days of July in France spread rapidly over Europe, especially
in Belgium and Poland, and met with great sympathy in England. Had an
unpopular monarch been upon the throne the Crown might easily have been
involved in the quarrel with the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the July Revolution in Belgium and
Poland.</div>

<p>In Belgium the revolutionary spirit assumed the form of a national
desire on the part of the French-speaking Belgians to sever themselves
from the Dutch kingdom to which they had been attached by the Treaties
of Vienna. There was good ground for their discontent. The King of the
Netherlands, a clever but injudicious man, had failed to fulfil his
engagements, and had ruled entirely in the interests of the Dutch part
of his kingdom. The liberty of the press granted by the constitution
had been superseded by a royal ordinance, intended to be temporary,
but still remaining in force; a judicial system by which the judges
were the nominees of the Crown had superseded the enactments of the
constitution, by which the judges were elective and irremoveable; the
King had twisted the clause recommending to his care the interests of
education to mean that education should be entirely in the power of
the Crown; the French language had been proscribed in all public acts,
and business had to be carried on in Dutch; an undue proportion of the
taxes was laid upon Belgium, and Protestants were chiefly employed
both in public and educational offices, though absolute equality
of religions had been guaranteed. There is no need to explain the
grievances of the Poles. Destroyed as a nation, divided recklessly
among their powerful neighbours, it was only too natural that they
should at once accept any hope of freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the July Revolution in England.</div>

<p>In England the Revolution in France met with universal sympathy
and admiration. Among those classes which of late years had been in
a constant state of discontent, it was accepted as an example to be
at once followed. But the orderly and self-restrained manner in which
the change in France had been effected had a far different and more
important effect than this. It seemed to show the possibility of great
and thorough changes being carried out without the excesses which had
hitherto accompanied revolutions, and had frightened the well-to-do
middle classes from any co-operation with the more eager and innovating
working-men. It seemed possible that the great question, which had been
almost crushed by the French wars and by the lengthened tenure of office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1420" id="Page_1420">[1420]</a></span>
by the Tories, might be revived and brought to a successful conclusion
without opening the flood-gates of social anarchy. Parliamentary reform
was at once taken up by the Whigs and by the great middle class of
England, who determined to try whether they could not win it in some
less objectionable form than it had assumed in the hands of radical
demagogues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Wellington's ministry.</div>

<p>In the midst of this renewed excitement both on the Continent and
in England, the ministry of Wellington, cut off from its old friends
and disowned by those whose policy it had been enforced to adopt,
stood as representative of the bygone system. The minister, though he
had already so frequently yielded to the pressure of circumstances,
was regarded as the friend of Polignac, the fallen French minister.
His foreign policy read by this light seemed to be directed entirely
to uphold the principles which had actuated the Tory Government at
the time of the Vienna Treaty. He was known to be at heart an enemy
of all change, and his conduct was therefore watched at this crisis
with extreme anxiety. It was felt at the time, and has since been
confessed, that his ministry during the last session had existed only
by the toleration of its enemies. With the death of the King the chief
necessity for retaining the Duke in his position had disappeared, and
the time seemed to have arrived for sweeping away the Government,
which was merely obstructive and bent at the best in keeping things
exactly as they were. The dissolution which necessarily followed the
accession of the new King afforded the Duke's enemies the opportunity
they required. In the midst of much excitement, for the reformers had
already begun to cover the land with associations, the elections took
place, with a result disastrous to Government. There was a loss of
at least fifty Government seats. While the Liberals made extreme and
successful efforts in places where the elections were open, the Tory
proprietors of boroughs, in their hatred to Wellington, whom they
regarded as their betrayer, brought in anti-ministerial nominees. The
temper of the people was shown by the election of Brougham, voluntarily
and without expense, to the representation of Yorkshire, by the loss of
their seats by two brothers and a brother-in-law of Peel, undoubtedly
the most important member of the Government after the Premier, and by
the fact that of the eighty-two representatives of English counties
not more twenty were ministerial. Such a change no doubt offered much
hope for the peaceful and parliamentary character of the constitutional
advance which it seemed now impossible to avoid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger from O'Connell's agitation for
repeal,</div>



<p>But there were still great dangers threatening the country. In
Ireland O'Connell was spending all his energies in preaching the
necessity of repeal, and heaping fierce and unmeaning words of hatred
upon the ministry. He had re-established the Association under the name
of "The Friends of Ireland," and when the Irish Government declared
this illegal, it assumed a new form as the Society of Irish Volunteers.
The lower classes were in a state of wild excitement, and their belief
in their leader was not checked by the inconsistency with which he now
extolled the Revolution in Belgium and in France, though hitherto,
in his love of Catholicism, the Catholic and Jesuit-loving Bourbons
had been the main subjects of his praise; nor did even the want of
courage with which he refused to give satisfaction for the insults he
had heaped on Lord Hardinge injure him with his followers. In October
it was found necessary in Tipperary to take means for suppressing an
outbreak by the use of the soldiery. In England events bearing a strong
resemblance to the opening of a revolution began to be visible. The
breaking of machines both in <span class="sidenote">and from
rick-burning.</span> manufacturing and agricultural districts, and
worse than that, in the South of England rick-burning, became constant.
No efforts and no rewards could arrive at a true knowledge of the
perpetrators of this crime. The farmers were kept in a constant state
of nervous anxiety. A certain number of people were apprehended
and hanged on the charge, but any man was still liable to find his
ricks, in spite of all his care, suddenly and mysteriously bursting
into flames. In London, too, the old demagogues began to make their
appearance. Hunt and Cobbett were again haranguing crowds and filling
their minds with hopes of social equality. Meanwhile the ministry
took no step to declare its intention, and made no advances towards
strengthening itself by union with any other party. It seemed indeed
possible for a moment that the Duke would again yield, readmit the
Canningites to his party, and produce some very moderate reform. If
such a plan existed, it disappeared after the <span class="sidenote">Death of Huskisson.</span>
death of Huskisson. On the 15th of September a number of guests, among
whom were the Minister, were asked to attend the opening of the first
great railway in England, running between Manchester and Liverpool. The
train, in which the guests were, stopped for water at Parkside. Several
gentlemen left their seats, and a mutual friend brought Huskisson to
the carriage where Wellington sat to attempt a reconciliation. The door
was open as the old friends greeted each other warmly. Suddenly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1422" id="Page_1422">[1422]</a></span>
train came up upon the other line, there was a cry of "Get to your
seats;" flurried and unable, apparently, to pass the open door,
Huskisson fell across the line, and was so severely injured that he
died the same evening. The rest of Canning's followers, although their
great leader had been an enemy to reform, at once made it plain that
they had joined the Opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament. Nov. 2, 1830.</div>

<p>It was thus, with unusual anxiety as to the conduct to be expected
from the ministry, that the opening of Parliament on the 2nd of
November was awaited. The worst enemies of the Duke could scarcely
have hoped for a more ill-judged production than the King's speech.
There was no sign that the very critical state of the country was
even acknowledged. The change of dynasty in France was mentioned
and accepted, the unpopular policy of the Government with regard to
Miguel praised, the civil war in Belgium spoken of in terms of severe
reprobation, and a determination expressed to uphold the present
political system; the disturbed temper of the people in England and
Ireland was mentioned with indignation, and the firm purpose of
Government declared to repress it by every means in their power. Of
recognition of the necessity of listening to what had now become the
expressed wish of the nation there was not a word. If anything could
be wanted to strengthen the impression caused by the speech, and to
make it clear that the ministry was more conservative than ever, it
was afforded by Wellington's words in the debate on the address in
answer to Lord Grey's recommendation that some plan of reform should be
undertaken. He declared his belief in the perfection of the legislative
system. It possessed the full and entire confidence of the country;
he was not therefore prepared to bring forward any measure of reform,
and might declare at once that "as long as he held any station in
the government of the country, he should always feel it his duty to
resist such measures when proposed by others." It was a challenge to
the reformers which was speedily answered. On the same night Brougham
announced his intention of bringing forward a motion for reform on
the 16th, and on that night the fate of the ministry must have been
decided. In the interval before the critical day the excitement of the
people was so great that the King's visit to the <span
class="sidenote">Resignation of the ministry.</span> City had to be
postponed, because Wellington was afraid to accompany him unless under
a strong armed escort. But before that day arrived the ministry found
an opportunity for resigning. Among the topics of the speech was the
reform of the Civil List. On the 15th Sir Henry Parnell brought in a
motion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1423" id="Page_1423">[1423]</a></span>
a Select Committee; the ministry opposed it on the ground that no
further economy was possible, and being beaten by a majority of
twenty-nine, after taking one day to consider, announced on the 16th
that their resignation had been accepted, and thus saved themselves
from defeat on the more momentous question of reform. During the
formation of the new ministry Brougham's motion was postponed, and it
was almost immediately known that he had passed into the Upper House
as Lord Chancellor, and that the first business of the new Government
would be the production of a Reform Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of Lord Grey's ministry.</div>

<p>At such a crisis it was impossible that any statesman except Lord
Grey should be intrusted with the formation of a Cabinet. Now nearly
seventy years of age, he had been the prominent leader in every
attempt at parliamentary reform for the last forty years. He found no
difficulty in selecting his ministers. As far as talents and debating
power went the Liberal party was very strong; it was not yet discovered
that the long absence of the party from office, and its consequent
ignorance of the routine and traditions of official work had rendered
most of its members rather weak administrators. The Chancellorship of
the Exchequer was given to Lord Althorp, a most amiable and excellent
man, a steady partisan of reform and retrenchment, but of an easy
and not very vigorous character. Lord Lansdowne was President of the
Council; Lambton, now become Lord Durham, Grey's son-in-law, was Lord
Privy Seal; the Secretaryships were supplied from the ranks of the
Canningites; Palmerston, Melbourne, and Goderich were respectively
Foreign, Home, and Colonial Secretaries. Charles Grant was President
of the Board of Control. Holland, Auckland, and Graham were also in
the Cabinet. In office, but not of the Cabinet, were Lord John Russell
as Paymaster-General, and Mr. Stanley, subsequently Lord Derby, as
Secretary for Ireland.</p>

<p>The duty which this ministry undertook was by no means a light
one; for though it was plain that reform in some shape or other
could no longer be delayed, its introduction was beset with difficulties,
of which the greatest was by no means the opposition to be apprehended
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties attending reform.</span> from
the open opponents of the measure. Any advance towards a fair
representation was certain to meet with the strongest opposition from
men who regarded any change as revolutionary, and saw a diminution of
their own interests in the slightest attacks upon the system of nominee
boroughs. But such bigoted and selfish opposition might certainly
sooner or later be overcome. A far greater danger was to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1424" id="Page_1424">[1424]</a></span>
in the exaggerated hopes which had been fostered for many years
among the suffering artisans, who had been taught by their leaders
and demagogues to ascribe all their miseries to the want of fair
representation. No measure which a ministry, aristocratic in its
character as the present ministry was, could introduce, no measure
which could satisfy the intelligent middle classes, to whom social
change was almost as abhorrent as to the Tories, could fail to cause
disappointment to the hopes of the lower classes; and when they found
how little practical relief they would gain by the measure, there was
only too much danger lest the revolution of which the opponents of the
measure were so fond of talking might really come into existence. Signs
of popular discontent were, as has been already mentioned, clearly to
be seen. Rick-burning still continued its course in the South, and
trades unions in their most aggravated form, and accompanied by murder,
had made their appearance in the manufacturing districts. Extreme
measures, such as the issuing of a special commission in the disturbed
districts, were urged upon the Government; but Lord Grey replied that
he considered the regular powers of the Government, if properly used,
were sufficient for all purposes. In fact, the ministry understood that
the contest was not an ordinary parliamentary one; it was scarcely
to be expected that of its own free will the House of Commons should
accept a Bill which must exclude many of its members from their seats;
it was as the spokesmen of a great national wish that the ministers
regarded themselves, and they intended to rely upon the nation for
their support. Not only did they therefore refrain from any exceptional
measures for the suppression of disturbance, they also allowed to pass
unquestioned the legality of the numerous political unions which,
following the example of the Union of Birmingham, of which Mr. Attwood
was the president, had sprung into existence all over England, and
which aimed at bringing into some sort of harmony the demands of the
wealthy and poorer classes. The ministry had in fact determined to use
all expressions of the national temper, even when verging upon breaches
of the Constitution, to forward what they conceived to be the great
healing measure which the evils of the times demanded. The struggle
thus assumed a far more dignified form than that of an ordinary
political question. In its first stage it was the people, as usual with
aristocratic leaders, who demanded and insisted upon their will being
heard by the Lower House. When that House had been reconstituted, and
become favourable to the popular claims, it was the people speaking
by the voice of their constitutionally chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1425" id="Page_1425">[1425]</a></span>
representatives, supported by an irresistible and probably
unconstitutional action from without, which engaged in a life and death
struggle with the aristocracy, clinging tenaciously to their ancient
privileges.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of February, when the Parliament reassembled, the
intention of the ministry to produce a measure of parliamentary reform
in both Houses was made known. The day for its introduction was fixed
for the 1st of March. The interval was passed in Parliament in the
ordinary business of the session, and in the introduction of a budget
which, betraying as it clearly did a tendency towards the policy of
Huskisson in favour of the manufacturing industries, was received with
an opposition which showed the temper of the House, and which would
probably under ordinary circumstances have caused the fall of the
ministry. But it was understood that it was upon reform and upon no
other question that the fate of the Government depended. Without the
walls of Parliament agitation was vigorously at work. Petition after
petition for and against the approaching measure was prepared, and the
whole country was upon the tiptoe of expectation when on the appointed
day Lord John <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_THE_FIRST_REFORM_BILL" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_THE_FIRST_REFORM_BILL"></a>Reception of the Reform Bill.
March 1, 1831.</span> Russell made his statement as to the character
of the Bill. Although it has since been found necessary more than once
to enlarge it, at the time the completeness of the Bill surprised
even the friends of Government, while it seemed to its opponents
little better than an ill-timed jest. As in all Bills for reform of
the representation, there were two points to be regarded: in the
first place, to secure that the representatives of the people should
be really representatives and not nominees; in the second place, to
secure by the arrangement of the franchise that they should as far as
practicable represent all classes of the nation. On the first of these
points the Bill was complete, with very few exceptions rotten boroughs
were entirely swept away; it is on the second point that subsequent
legislation has been found necessary. The Bill as originally presented
destroyed at once sixty rotten boroughs, but with regard to the
franchise and the distribution of seats, as will be seen subsequently,
it showed considerable favour to the counties, that is to the landed
interest and to the middle classes, excluding entirely the artisan
class, which, when its members are prosperous and possess property, is
one of the most valuable elements in the constitution of the nation.
As Lord John Russell read the list of disfranchised boroughs, he was
greeted with shouts of laughter and ironical cries of "Hear" from the
members who represented them. The debate on the first reading continued
for seven nights; the chief objection raised was that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1426" id="Page_1426">[1426]</a></span>
balance of the Constitution would be changed and the power of the
House of Lords diminished. It was, however, passed without division,
the struggle being deferred to the second reading. Although its
deficiencies were obvious enough to the advanced reformers, the
importance of securing the one great step in advance which it promised
in the annihilation of rotten boroughs caused its general acceptance,
and "The Bill and nothing but the Bill" became the watchword of the
Liberal party in England. There was considerable disturbance, as
was to be expected, throughout the country, and in anticipation of
a strong opposition many of the political unions came to the formal
determination that, if necessary, they would refrain from paying
taxes, and would even march to London; they issued lists showing
the numbers on which they could count, and it began to be plain
that, if constitutional means failed, the Bill would be carried by
unconstitutional pressure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The second reading of the Reform Bill. March
21.</div>

<p>The second reading at length came on, and in the fullest House ever
known, 608 members being present, the ministry secured a majority of
one. Precedent would have demanded their resignation, but regarding
themselves as charged with a great national duty they kept their
places, and all England illuminated at the news. The next process was
to pass the Bill through Committee, and there the weakness of the
Government at once disclosed itself. They were defeated by a majority
of eight on a clause for reducing the whole number of members, and
three days afterwards the House refused to go into a question of
supply. The ministry, determined to bring matters to a crisis, regarded
this, not without some exaggeration, as a refusal of supplies, and
declared that they could do nothing but resign; but the King, as yet
true to them, refused their resignation, at the same time expressing a
very strong wish not to dissolve the House. As the Parliament was now
in its first session, this wish of the King was by no means unnatural,
yet only by a dissolution could the ministers and the Reform Bill be
saved. They themselves subsequently declared their belief that this
was the real crisis of the question. The Opposition also felt the
importance of the moment, and through their leader, Lord Wharnecliffe,
moved an address to the King, remonstrating against the intended
dissolution. What the arguments of <span class="sidenote">Dissolution
of the Parliament. April 22.</span> the ministry had been unable to
effect was done at once by this ill-judged piece of violence, which the
King considered an attack upon his prerogative. He immediately declared
his determination to dissolve the House. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1427" id="Page_1427">[1427]</a></span>
scene of excitement in the Lords has rarely been equalled when he
suddenly made his appearance and demanded the presence of the Commons.
An equally tumultuous scene had been going forward in the Lower House,
the Speaker had himself been unable to obtain a hearing. At the summons
of the Usher of the Black Rod, the Commons appeared at the bar of
the Upper House, and were at once told by the King, in an unusually
cheerful and firm tone, that he had come there for the purpose of
proroguing them, with a view to immediate dissolution, in order to
ascertain the sense of his people on the question of representation.</p>

<p>The dissolution thus taking place in the midst of the violent and
strongly-organized agitation of the nation, virtually secured the
passing of the Bill, although a long and dangerous period of contest
had yet to be passed. That the mob should break out here and there in
riots was inevitable; but it was the firm and determined attitude, not
of the rioters, but of the great body of intelligent non-electors,
which really influenced the elections. In all directions reformers were
successful. Six county members only were opposed to the Bill, and when
in July the second reading came on, the ministers found themselves in a
majority of 136. Manifestly outnumbered, the opponents to the measure
had recourse to an irritating form of warfare. Every single detail was
fought over in Committee. There was a hope that, as the summer went
on, the patience of members would be tired out, that the session must
either be terminated or an accidental victory be snatched from the
Government. So weary was the nation of the lengthened delay, that the
political unions held a meeting to settle how much longer they would
wait, but the question was too important to allow of any laxity on
the part <span class="sidenote">The Bill passes in the Commons. Sept.

of the Committee was brought up. On the 21st, after another debate of
three nights, the Bill passed the Commons by a majority of 109. Its
fate now rested with the Peers, and <span class="sidenote">The Bill
rejected in the Lords. Oct. 8.</span> they were not long in showing how
they meant to deal with it. On the first reading it was thrown out by a
majority of forty-one. The opponents of the measure fondly hoped that
its fate and that of the administration were now sealed, but the Lords
had not yet secured a victory. Indignant at the rejection of their
Bill, the Commons at once passed a vote of confidence in the ministry,
and all fear of their resignation was thus removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1428" id="Page_1428">[1428]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequent riots in the country.</div>

<p>But the indignation of the Commons was nothing to that of the
people at large, who saw the measure from which they hoped so much
snatched from them by the votes of a few wealthy and important men,
who in no sense represented them, and whose opposition bore in the
popular eye all the appearance of a selfish struggle for an exclusive
and injurious privilege. Again the disorderly mobs of London and other
large towns broke out into riots, but the number of rioters was usually
few, and many of them were known as belonging to the regular criminal
and ruffianly class. Of these riots the most important was that which
occurred in Bristol on the 29th of October. The occasion was the public
entry of Sir Charles Wetherell, a bitter opponent of reform, into the
city, of which he was recorder. It afforded another instance of the
mismanagement of the local magistracy. A mob, which seems never to
have reached a thousand in number, took possession of the town for two
days, broke into the mansion-house, and got drunk in the cellars, and
then, undisturbed, and after giving full notice of their intention,
set fire to Queen's Square, and burnt two sides of it to the ground.
The military had been in the town all day; at length they proceeded
to act, and re-established order with little difficulty, though with
some loss of life. Their commander was Colonel Brereton. The mayor
and magistrates had weakly given him but a general authority to act
on his discretion, willing no doubt to shift the responsibility to
his shoulders. A man of kind heart, he had shrunk from acting without
more distinct authority; he had tried his best to calm the crowd by
friendly means, which only increased their confidence and encouraged
them with hopes of impunity. He was tried by court martial, and, unable
to face the prospect of a slur on his professional character, committed
suicide. But far more important than these
<span class="sidenote">Organized action of the political unions.</span>
riots was the constantly increasing vigour shown by the organized
unions. Hitherto left untouched by the Government, they now proceeded
to measures which clearly brought them under the action of the law.
The London Radicals held a great meeting on the 31st of October in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, presided over by Sir Francis Burdett, when a
National Union was established, intended to draw together the various
unions of the country, and to form a central directory of delegates.
Before the meeting separated, it was plain that some of its members
were ready to go much further than the unions had yet gone, and the
Metropolitan Union summoned a meeting for the 7th of November, and
issued a programme demanding the abolition of all hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1429" id="Page_1429">[1429]</a></span>
privileges and distinctions of rank. On this occasion the Government
acted quickly and wisely. Lord Melbourne received a deputation of
the Union, and persuaded them to postpone their meeting, and shortly
afterwards, on the 22nd of November, a proclamation was issued for the
suppression of such political clubs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of the King.</div>

<p>This proclamation is believed to have been put forward at the
instigation of the King, who had been much frightened by the riots at
Bristol, and was constantly worked upon by the ladies of the Court, who
were strong anti-reformers. His support could be no longer relied on by
the ministry, and at this time his help was more especially necessary,
as it began to dawn upon men's minds that nothing short of a large
creation of Peers could overwhelm the obstinate majority of the Upper
House, and secure the passage of the Bill. As the last Bill had been
rejected, before the fight in the Upper House could be recommenced the
whole work had to be gone through again in the House of Commons. It
was not <span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTWO_THE_SECOND_BILL_PASSES" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTWO_THE_SECOND_BILL_PASSES"></a>The Bill passes on the second reading
in the Lords. April 14, 1832.</span> long delayed there. Brought in
by Lord John Russell on the 12th of December, it finally passed the
Commons by a majority of 116 on the 23rd of March. On the 14th of April
the second reading of the Bill in the Lords took place, and it became
apparent that a certain number of the Peers had taken fright at the
threatened increase to their numbers, and had begun to recognize the
danger of their obstructive policy; the ministry succeeded in obtaining
a majority of nine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations during the recess.</div>

<p>The 7th of May, after the Easter holidays, was the day fixed for the
Committee on the Bill. The holidays were well used by the reformers
outside Parliament. Monster meetings were everywhere held, and the
Political Union of Birmingham, which held the first rank among the
popular organizations, appointed a great meeting of all the unions of
the counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford for the same day as
the opening of Parliament. The recess was not less eagerly employed
by the anti-reformers; his Tory friends, his courtiers, his wife, and
his sisters, worked upon the King's mind; he was persuaded to refuse
the creation of Peers, and to try once more what coercion could do in
suppressing the national ferment; the Duke of Wellington was applied
to, and orders to keep the troops in readiness were sent to various
parts of England, especially to Birmingham. Thus, when the day arrived,
while 150,000 men assembled at Newhall Hill in Birmingham were swearing
with bare heads and raised hands, "With unbroken faith, through every
peril and privation, we here devote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1430" id="Page_1430">[1430]</a></span>
ourselves and our children to our country's cause," Lord Lyndhurst,
<span class="sidenote">The Bill rejected in the Lords. May 7.</span>
who had been most active in organizing the present opposition, had
contrived to secure a majority of thirty-five in the House of Lords for
a motion postponing the disfranchising clauses of the Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ministry resigns. The Duke of Wellington
fails to form a ministry.</div>

<p>The antagonistic forces seemed to have come to a final issue, from
which there was no escape except by the creation of Peers, a measure
as repugnant to the aristocratic feeling of Lord Grey as to the King.
The Prime Minister, however, explaining the situation, demanded of
the King the one necessary step. He was refused, and resigned. His
resignation was accepted, and the Duke of Wellington was sent for to
attempt to form a Conservative ministry. At the same time things had
gone too far for complete repression, and the Duke was instructed to
form a ministry which would introduce some extensive measure of reform.
The news of the fall of the ministry was received in fierce anger by
the whole people. The papers came out in mourning. The National Union
decreed that whoever should advise a dissolution was a public enemy.
Petitions praying that no supplies should be granted till the Bill was
passed were signed in a few hours by many thousands of people, and sent
to London, where they were joyfully received by the House of Commons.
The great Birmingham Union made preparations to march to London
200,000 strong, and encamp on Hampstead Heath. Two insurmountable
difficulties met the Duke of Wellington, and prevented the inevitable
ruin which must have followed his success. It became clear to him
that the military could not be trusted, that repression by force was
out of the question, and he could find no Conservatives sufficiently
courageous <span class="sidenote">The old ministry returns to office.

to have recourse to his former ministers. It was plain to the Lords
that further opposition was useless, and would lead only to a public
proof of the powerlessness of their resistance by the creation of new
Peers. They therefore wisely <span class="sidenote">The Bill passes in
the Lords. June 4.</span> attended to a circular letter from the King
himself, begging them to withdraw their opposition. Wellington left the
House, and was followed by about a hundred other Peers; the Bishops in
a body withdrew their opposition, and the Bill was finally carried by a
considerable majority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of the Reform Bill.</div>

<p>The measure as passed was not and could not be final, but it
was a wide, comprehensive and judicious beginning.
The chief evil of the representation had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1431" id="Page_1431">[1431]</a></span>
existence of nomination and rotten boroughs; of these 56, having less
than 2000 inhabitants, were disfranchised, and 111 seats left vacant.
Thirty boroughs, with less than 4000 inhabitants, were each deprived of
one member; Weymouth and Melcombe Regis lost two. There were thus 143
seats to dispose of. Of these 65 went to the counties, an arrangement
which showed the still unbroken power of the landed aristocracy,
twenty-two large towns received the right of returning two members, and
21 the right of returning one. The remaining 13 were left for Ireland
and Scotland. The second evil was the very irregular and restricted
franchise. In some towns the freemen alone elected; in others the
suffrage was almost universal; the whole number of electors on the roll
was very small. A uniform £10 household franchise was now established
in boroughs, but, as a concession to the rights of vested interests,
freemen of corporate towns who resided within the borough, and who had
been created before 1831, were allowed to retain their votes. In the
counties copyholders and leaseholders were added to the constituencies,
and by a clause introduced by the Marquis of Chandos, and carried in
opposition to the Government, tenants at will paying a rent of £50 were
also enfranchised. In this point again the landed interest showed its
power, as such tenants were only too liable to be influenced by their
landlords. At the same time, to decrease the disorders and expenses
of elections, the duration of the poll was shortened. The period of
fifteen days during which in county elections votes could be taken was
restricted to two in England and to five in Ireland. Along with the
English Bill, Reform Bills for Scotland and Ireland were also produced
and passed. In Scotland the representation had been far more imperfect
than in England; it was now wholly remodelled. The county franchise was
given to all owners of property, and long leaseholders of the value
of £10 a year, and even to tenants for shorter periods paying a rent
of £50; in the burghs the same £10 franchise was established as in
England. The number of burgh representatives was changed from fifteen
to twenty-three. The number of county members remained the same as
before, but with some slight difference in distribution. To Ireland
four additional boroughs were allowed, the counties there remained the
same. But considerable discontent was caused by the adoption of the
£10 freehold franchise in the counties, which very much restricted the
number of the electors, from whom it will be remembered that till quite
lately a 40s. qualification only was required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of the measure.</div>

<p>Thus was completed, after a delay of nearly an hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1432" id="Page_1432">[1432]</a></span>
years, the second act of the English Revolution. Incomplete and
aristocratic in its character, the movement of 1688 yet established
the superiority of Parliament as a whole, and its predominance over
the royal power. From that time onwards the Government had been in the
hands of the aristocracy, from whichever of the political parties the
members of the administration had been drawn. The attempt of George
III. to re-establish the power of the Crown had been attended with some
success as long as it was supported by the good wishes of the people.
Events had allied him with a party bent on the repression of all
popular movements and of all constitutional growth. Submissive during
the war, the people on the return of peace had been aroused to a sense
of the injury under which they suffered by their exclusion from all
share in the Government. Events in France had brought their discontent
to a climax, and they had now at length gained possession of that
part of the Legislature which had long pretended falsely to represent
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction of the middle classes to power.</div>

<p>But although the change effected by the Reform Bill at first
sight appears to have been political, it was in fact social. It was
the introduction of a wholly new class of society into the duties
of Government. The aristocratic classes, which had hitherto had the
monopoly of power, were forced to admit to an equality with themselves
the middle class, which the progress of society, and the wonderful
advance of material improvement during the last half century, had
raised to a position so important that its claims could no longer be
withstood. Its victory had been secured by a twofold alliance. On the
one hand it had taken advantage of the real wants of the classes below
it, and of the social ideas which had been called into existence by
the French Revolution; it had not scrupled to employ the modern arts
of agitation, or to bring what cannot be regarded in any other light
than as an unconstitutional pressure to bear upon Parliament. On the
other hand it had worked constitutionally by an alliance with one of
the governing classes, namely, the Whigs. Long exclusion from office
had as usual made this party alive to the existence of abuses, the
defensive and obstructive attitude of the Tories had reawakened its
desire for constitutional growth, and the philosophy and writings
of the time, especially those of Bentham and of the authors of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, had taken considerable hold of its leading members.
The Whig Government therefore, with complete honesty, and in the midst
of considerable danger and difficulty, accepted the alliance which the
middle classes offered it, and honourably fulfilled its share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1433" id="Page_1433">[1433]</a></span>
of the compact. Now that the great Bill was passed, it remained to be
seen how far the Whigs were willing to forego their old aristocratic
prejudices, and how far their strength would allow them to oppose the
pressure of the extreme Radicals, whose alliance they had been forced
to accept along with that of the middle class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anxiety as to the effect of the change.</div>

<p>It was with the utmost anxiety that the character of the first
reformed Parliament was watched. There was a general feeling of terror
throughout England. Timid investors began to seek securities for their
money in America or Denmark. There was a constant apprehension of a
coming revolution which might resemble that in France; a feeling which
was not appeased by occasional acts of violence throughout the country,
and a fierce and dangerous assault by the London mob upon the Duke
of Wellington himself. It is possible that in any other country such
a revolution might have resulted; but the practical character of the
English mind, which prevents it from being carried away by a passionate
desire for ideal benefits, the wide diffusion and extremely strong
love of property, the firm and dignified attitude of the nobility, the
loyalty with which the really active part of the Tory party accepted
the change and determined to make the best of it, secured tranquillity
for the country during its passage through the dangerous crisis. It
may also be reckoned as no small advantage to the cause of order,
that the English Radicals found themselves thrown into the company
of O'Connell and the Irish agitators; the clamour for repeal, the
lawless violence which showed itself in the sister island, and the
unscrupulous character of the demagogue who represented it, gave a
strength and unity to the moderate Whig party which it would otherwise
have wanted. At the same time the twofold connections and interests
of the Government could not but, sooner or later, prove a cause of
weakness. Their aristocratic tendencies, which remained unabated,
prevented them from throwing themselves heartily into the wishes of
their more popular supporters, and laid them open to the constant
suspicion of an inclination towards Toryism. Their dependence on the
popular party compelled them to take in hand many difficult questions
for the solution of which the nation was clamouring. They had therefore
to be constantly steering a middle course, and assuming an appearance
of weakness which rapidly undermined their popularity, while the two
tendencies which they represented, affecting the individual members
of the Cabinet in different degrees, speedily led to a division among
themselves. It is for these reasons that the work of the first reformed
Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1434" id="Page_1434">[1434]</a></span>
great as it was, has an appearance of weakness as compared with the
burst of popular reform which might have been expected after so great a
change.</p>

1833.</div>

<p>When Parliament assembled it appeared that the Whigs had on the
whole a very large majority; but, besides an active and important
body of Tories headed by Sir Robert Peel, there were a considerable
number of Radicals, of whom Hume may be regarded as the leader, and
the Irish members, for the most part the mere nominees and puppets of
O'Connell, from whom opposition might be expected. There were changes
both in the appearance and character of the House; the average age
of the members was visibly increased, and it was evident that there
would be more individual opinion, less distinctly party voting, and a
greater necessity for convincing argument to ensure a majority. It was
plain, too, that with much less of oratory there would be a far greater
quantity of talking; and as the Government, in the King's speech,
promised to introduce a number of very important Bills, it was found
necessary greatly to lengthen the hours of business. At the same time,
as there were no less than three hundred new members in the House, it
was thought advisable to reappoint the old Speaker, Manners-Sutton,
although he was a Tory in politics, a step which at once excited the
displeasure of the more advanced Liberals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Critical questions to be settled.</div>

<p>The questions most generally occupying men's minds, and which it
might be supposed would at once become prominent, were the disturbed
and wretched condition of the poor, as evidenced by the late riots
and constant rick-burning; the position of the Church; slavery; and
the national relations to foreign countries, especially Belgium and
the Peninsula; but, before all, the condition of Ireland, and the
maintenance of the Protestant Church in that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition of Ireland.</div>

<p>It was the Irish question which became at once the most important,
and which ultimately caused the fall of the ministry. It was understood
that some measures of coercion would be necessary to restore
tranquillity in that country, but that they should go hand in hand with
measures of reform and relief. As though to render the coming Coercion
Bill more palatable, Lord Althorp, on the 12th of February, introduced
a Bill for the regulation of the Irish Church. Since the Catholic
Emancipation Act the state of Ireland had been becoming constantly
worse. Instead of accepting the Act in a conciliatory spirit, O'Connell
had used it as a stepping-stone for further demands, and had continued
his course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1435" id="Page_1435">[1435]</a></span>
agitation. He had been prosecuted in 1831, had pleaded guilty to
holding illegal assemblies, but by the carelessness of the Whig
Government he had escaped without punishment. His present demand was
repeal, but the outrages which filled Ireland were either agrarian or
connected with the tithes; and O'Connell skilfully managed, while by
his agitation he continually kept up the discontent, to keep clear
himself of any participation in the violence of his countrymen. Of
course the repeal of the Union could not be for a moment thought of,
but the Government could not deny that the position of the Irish Church
and the collection of tithes for its support were real grievances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of the Irish Church.</div>

<p>In a country of which the population was somewhat over seven
millions, there was established a dominant Protestant Church, the
members of which numbered 853,000 only. It had a staff of no less than
four archbishops and eighteen bishops, many of them with very large
incomes, and a body of clergy supported principally by tithes, exacted
not only from its own members, but from the six million and a half
Catholics. To make matters worse, the tithe was paid by the tenants,
and, as the land was infinitely subdivided, in minute sums which
rendered its forcible exaction most irksome and ridiculous. In many
instances a man's tithe was a farthing, and in some cases not more than
seven parts of a farthing. So vexatious and unjust a tax was certain
to cause exasperation. In 1831 the collection of tithes became almost
impossible; the collectors were murdered, the police who came to their
rescue fired upon, cattle driven off that the tithe might not be paid,
and the clergy were consequently reduced to such a miserable plight
that some of them were actually brought to the verge of starvation.
But in spite of the glaring anomaly of the existence of the Church
at all, and of the ill-feeling and violence excited by the exaction
of the tithes, neither Lord Grey nor Mr. Stanley, his Secretary for
Ireland, could bring themselves to think of any wide measure of reform,
so great was their dread of touching property or vested interests, or
of in any way injuring the Church. In February 1832 committees were
appointed to inquire into the system. They reported that the complete
extinction of tithes by a commutation or charge upon the land was
absolutely necessary. The Irish took this as an authorization of their
proceedings; the outrages increased, and a system of terrorism was
established, which precluded the possibility of bringing the assassins
and rioters to justice. In June the Government had adopted a plan which
in fact made matters worse. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1436" id="Page_1436">[1436]</a></span>
authorized the advance of £60,000 to the Irish clergy, who were unable
to collect their tithes, and took upon themselves the duty of
collecting former arrears, at the same time promising that the tithe
commutation should be undertaken. A Bill to this effect was passed,
rendering commutation necessary for a term of twenty-one years. Other
Bills providing for the redemption of the tithe were unfortunately
allowed to stand over to the next session. But Government had now made
itself a tithe collector, and was so inefficient in that capacity that
it had subsequently to allow that of £104,000 due £12,000 only had been
levied, and that with some loss of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish Tithe Composition Bill passed. Aug. 28,
1833.</div>

<p>In the year 1833 a new arrangement was consequently attempted. The
whole amount of arrears for the last three years amounted to about a
million. This sum the Government proposed should be advanced by an
issue of Exchequer bills, to be repaid gradually by a general land
tax. As there seemed only too much probability that the land tax would
be refused with as great determination as the tithes, most people
regarded this sum as a mere gift to the Irish clergy. The Government
was, however, able to pass the Bill. The final settlement of the tithe
question was postponed for several years; meanwhile the violence which
attended the attempts at collecting the tithes were the chief cause of
the necessity of the Coercion Bill.</p>

<p>But the tithes, though the immediate cause of the disturbances,
were only a part of the whole Church system; it was the Church
itself which was the primary cause of the evil, and in the measure
<span class="sidenote">Althorp's Irish Church Bill. Feb. 1833.</span>
for the relief which was to accompany the Bill for the repression of
disturbance, the ministers addressed themselves to lessen the more
glaring defects of that institution; but at the same time they were as
little disposed to injure the Church as the Tories themselves, and one
of the chief objects of the proposed legislation was the improvement
of the position of the clergy. It was thought that while the lessening
of the hierarchy and the removal of some of the anomalies exhibited
by the Church would be pleasing to the Irish, the Church would itself
gain strength by the proposed changes. Besides the payment of tithes,
a church cess, for the support of the buildings and expenses of the
services, was paid indiscriminately by members of all religions,
but managed by Protestant vestries. The annates, or first-fruits of
livings, had been originally employed for these purposes, but in
process of time had almost disappeared; such benefices as were still
subject to them were to be now freed, a graduated tax to be laid upon
all livings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1437" id="Page_1437">[1437]</a></span>
and with the produce the Church cess was to be extinguished. This
was a direct boon to the Catholics. Another common complaint was the
disproportion between the number of bishoprics and the Protestant
population; it was now proposed to destroy ten of these bishoprics, or
rather, as the ministry was careful to explain, not to destroy but to
consolidate them with those which remained. The incomes of some of the
larger bishoprics were also curtailed; the surplus money thus arising
was to be paid into the hands of ecclesiastical commissioners. Thus
far there was not much objectionable in the Bill, though the Tories
and High Churchmen of England disliked the destruction of so many
sees. But there was a further measure, which opened the door to grave
opposition. It was proposed to change the terms on which church lands
were let so as to improve the position of the tenant without injuring
the clergy. The tenant would be willing to pay for this advantage, and
the sum thus gained was calculated at between two and three millions.
This money would, as the mover of the Bill expressed it, be available
for the purposes of the State. This had all the appearance of an act of
confiscation, the property of the Church was to be taken and applied to
purposes not ecclesiastical. But the Irish Secretary had as strong a
view as the Tories of the sanctity of Church property, and the danger
of tampering in ever so small a way with the rights of property. It was
therefore found necessary by the supporters of the Bill to invent a
theory to secure unanimity in the Cabinet; it was argued that the sum
derived from the change of tenure did not exist before, but would be
created by the present act of the Legislature, that it was therefore
not Church property at all, and might be applied to the purposes of
the State. The Bill in this shape was introduced by Lord Althorp on
the 12th of February. It at once appeared open to objections on two
sides. While O'Connell and the Irish scoffed at the relief, which
consisted only in removing the church cess, and the English Radicals
declared that instead of twelve bishops one was amply sufficient for
the needs of the Irish Protestants, the Tories, refusing to recognize
the delicate line between Church property and money gained by the
Legislature from Church property, raised the cry that it was but a
first step in confiscation, and threatened not the security of Church
property only, but that of all other property. It appeared necessary to
choose between the views of one or the other of these sets of critics,
and in spite of his own views, Lord Althorp consented to be governed by
the Conservative element in the Cabinet and to withdraw what was called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1438" id="Page_1438">[1438]</a></span>
Appropriation clause. The removal of this clause, which contained the
only important principle in the Bill, the right, namely, of Parliament
to apply Church property to the wants of the State, rendered it so
like a Tory measure, that with the assistance of that party it passed
without difficulty in both Houses (July 30).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Coercion Bill introduced Feb. 15, 1833,
carried March 29.</div>

<p>But three days after the introduction of the Irish Church Bill in
the House of Commons, Lord Grey introduced into the House of Lords
its complement, the Coercion Bill. Here again the absence of broad
liberality in the ministry was apparent. It was conceived in the spirit
of the most absolute government, and implied a distinct determination
to make no attempt at pacification by liberal concessions. It was the
work of Mr. Stanley, the Irish Secretary, a man of great ability and
vigour, but without much sympathy for the Irish character, and, as his
subsequent career proved, at heart a Tory. There was no difficulty in
making out a case for the Bill. A narration of a few of the crimes
which had of late filled Ireland with horror made it evident that
something must be done. In the province of Leinster alone, in the three
months July, August, and September, there had been 1279 crimes, in the
following three months the number had risen to 1646. During the year
the catalogue of Irish crimes contained 172 homicides, 465 robberies,
568 burglaries, 454 acts of houghing cattle, 2095 illegal notices, 425
illegal meetings, 796 malicious injuries to property, 753 attacks on
houses, 280 arsons, and 3156 serious assaults: in all upwards of 9000
crimes connected with the disturbed state of the country. Well might
Mr. Macaulay say that he "solemnly declared he would rather live in the
midst of many civil wars he had read of than in some parts of Ireland
at this moment." It was not the number of crimes alone which rendered
them terrible; they were carried on upon a system by which such terror
had been excited that it was impossible to get juries to convict even
after the clearest proof, or witnesses to give evidence as to what
they knew. At the same time, the leaders of the people were teaching
them, in public meetings and in assemblies of the so-called Association
of Volunteers, to regard themselves as the victims of every form of
oppression. To meet such a state of things it was proposed to place in
the hands of the Lord Lieutenant, in accordance with the Proclamation
Act of the 8th of George IV., 1828, power to suppress every meeting
or association which he regarded as dangerous to the preservation of
peace, under whatever name it might call itself, and further to declare
any district to be in a disturbed state, which was then to be regarded
as a proclaimed district; its inhabitants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1439" id="Page_1439">[1439]</a></span>
to be confined to their houses from an hour after sunset till sunrise,
the right of meeting and petitioning was withdrawn from them without
leave of the Lord Lieutenant, and they were placed under martial law.
The Bill further gave power to enter houses in search of arms, forbade
the distribution of seditious papers, and suspended the Habeas Corpus
in the proclaimed districts. The Bill passed without difficulty in
the House of Lords, where it was in harmony with the general feeling.
In the Lower House it was introduced on the 27th of February by Lord
Althorp, who, while corroborating the accounts of the outrages in
Ireland, could not help showing his dissatisfaction at the extreme
severity of the Bill. Not so Mr. Stanley, who, with the fiery vehemence
which characterized him, turned upon O'Connell, and overwhelmed him
with a flood of bitter invective, carrying the House completely with
him, and securing the passage of the Bill, which was also most ably
supported by Sir Robert Peel and his friends. Its effect was immediate
and most satisfactory. Within a week of its passage the Marquis of
Anglesey, who had returned to his office on Grey's accession to the
ministry, had suppressed the Association of Irish Volunteers, the town
and county of Kilkenny were then proclaimed, but so effective was the
mere dread of the measure, that it was never found necessary to hold a
single court-martial in the district, and within two months there was a
decrease of two-thirds in the general list of crimes. A rapid rise in
the funds showed that the moneyed public at least were pleased with the
vigorous measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in the ministry. March 1833.</div>

<p>Mr. Stanley's share in the Bill, the severity of his views with
regard to Ireland, and the personal bitterness between himself and
O'Connell, rendered his further tenure of the office of Secretary
undesirable. He was moved to the Colonial Office, from which Lord
Goderich, now become Earl of Ripon, withdrew to accept the Privy Seal,
while Lord Durham, who had hitherto held that office, retired from
the ministry (March 12). Mr. Stanley was succeeded by Sir John Cam
Hobhouse, who however only held the office for two months, and was in
turn succeeded by Mr. Littleton (May). The withdrawal of Lord Durham,
although attributed and partly due to ill-health, was probably caused
principally by the growing divisions in the Cabinet. The Conservative
tendencies of the Prime Minister and the severity of the Irish Act were
not in accordance with Lord Durham's advanced liberalism. The shortness
of Hobhouse's tenure of office may be traced to somewhat similar
causes, or at least to the decrease of the popularity of Government.
In company with several others he had at the late elections pledged
himself to vote for the repeal of the house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1440" id="Page_1440">[1440]</a></span>
window tax. In April the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Althorp,
brought in his budget. By careful economy, the abolition of
sinecures, and the reduction of the public expenses, he was able to
show a surplus of about a million and a half after replacing the
deficit of the former year. This surplus he intended to employ in
reducing some taxes which he regarded as particularly heavy, such as
those on soap, on marine insurances, and some of the assessed taxes.
But he impartially refused to listen either to the outcry of the towns
for the abolition of the house and window tax, or to the clamours of
the agriculturists against the malt tax; he regarded them both as
necessary sources of revenue. The carelessness of Government subjected
it to a temporary defeat on a subsequent motion for the
reduction of the malt tax to one half. Though the defeat caused
great irritation to the ministers it was speedily retrieved. A motion
against the house and window tax was also brought in, and Lord
Althorp, in opposing it, argued that the removal of either tax
alone would be an unfair advantage to one or other of the rival
interests, and that the removal of both was impossible; he introduced
an amendment to the effect that the reduction of the malt
tax and the repeal of the house tax would necessitate a general
property and income tax, and a change in our financial system. As
this amendment was carried, both the taxes were retained; but the
ministers could not but feel that they owed their success to the support
of their enemies, and the popular indignation was great. Hobhouse,
unable to vote against Government, and thus to redeem his
pledge, felt it incumbent on him to resign both his place and seat. On
appealing again to his constituents at Westminster he was rejected for
Colonel de Lacy Evans, a more advanced Liberal. The same thing
happened in the cases of Dr. Lushington and Mr. William Brown in
the Tower Hamlets and Southwark. A great indignation meeting,
attended with some violence, was held near Coldbath Fields, and
several great towns passed resolutions to the effect, that the ministers,
by violating the constitution of Ireland, refusing to inquire into the
public distress, continuing the house and window tax, and by forcing
the whole malt tax, already once repealed, upon the nation, had
betrayed the confidence of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of the ministry.</div>

<p>Thus in all directions the power of the Government was decreasing;
they were divided among themselves, and gradually losing the popularity
of the country. Yet they were still able to carry out successfully some
of the duties they had set themselves to perform; before the close of
the session they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1441" id="Page_1441">[1441]</a></span>
renewed the Bank charter, settled the affairs of the East India
Company, and completed the emancipation of the slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of the Bank charter. June.</div>

<p>The last renewal of the Bank charter had been in 1800; since then
events of the greatest importance with regard to currency and credit
had taken place,&mdash;the resumption of cash payments at the close
of the war, and the great commercial crisis of 1825 and 1826. It was
felt that the system of the Bank required close examination, and in
May 1832 a very influential committee had been appointed to examine
it preparatory to the renewal of the charter, which came to an end
in August 1833. Upon the information gained by this committee the
ministerial propositions were based. On the whole it appeared clear
that a single bank of issue was better than several competing banks.
The Bank was therefore to retain its monopoly. The principle of the
Directors, that a third of the value of their obligations should be
kept in hand in specie, was considered sound; but that the public might
in future have control of the issue of notes, the Bank was required to
publish a weekly account of its notes and deposits, and a quarterly
average showing its general condition. No other bank of more than six
partners, within sixty-five miles of London, was to be allowed to
issue paper, while notes of the Bank of England and its branches were
made legal tender, except at the bank from which they were issued. It
was hoped by this means that country banks, being able to meet their
demands with bank notes, would be saved from the necessity of making
large and rapid demands upon the Bank of England, and thus dangerously
lessening the supply of gold. The whole sum due from the Government to
the Bank, and from which that institution derived its great credit, was
fourteen millions. This was regarded as too much; it was to be reduced
to eleven millions, twenty-five per cent., being at once repaid to the
Bank, while to balance its advantages the Bank was to receive £120,000
a year less than hitherto for the management of the National Debt. On
these terms the charter was to be renewed for twenty-one years, but
with an option allowed to Government for breaking it off on a year's
notice after eleven years. The two points which met with the greatest
opposition were the terms which the Government had made with the Bank
and the compulsory currency given to bank notes. On the first of these
points it seemed almost unanimously felt that the Bank had made too
good a bargain; on the second it was hastily urged by many that it
was a partial resumption of the inconvertible currency. It was shown
without much difficulty that this was not the case, as the Bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1442" id="Page_1442">[1442]</a></span>
England was bound ultimately to meet its liabilities in gold; but
even Sir Robert Peel objected to the measure, avowing his fear that
it would cause a depreciation of the paper. Experience has proved
that this fear was groundless, and although the arrangements with
the Bank had subsequently to be somewhat modified, the Bill passed,
and was a distinct advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Settlement of the East India Company. July.</div>

<p>But, if it had been thought well to continue the monopoly of the
great banking corporation in England, the whole force of the commercial
feeling of the time set directly against the perpetuation of the
monopoly of the East India Company. The necessity for corporate trading
had disappeared. The restrictions it laid upon free trade had become
only so many obstacles in the way of extended commerce. Already, in
1813, this had been so clearly felt that the merchants of the great
trading centres, Liverpool, Glasgow, Paisley, and Manchester, had
succeeded in procuring the admission of traders to the territories of
the Company, and to India generally, but the corporation still retained
the trade with China. The accounts of the Company after this renewal of
its charter rendered it plain that it could not compete with private
merchants. It seemed clear that in China, as in India, the destruction
of the monopoly would extend commerce. It was therefore determined
to destroy the Company as a commercial body, allowing it to keep its
territorial position. After April 1834 its commercial property was to
be sold. It was, however, to retain the government of India, and to
receive for forty years an annuity from the Indian revenue of £630,000,
at the close of which period Parliament might redeem it by the payment
of £12,000,000. It was further arranged that all restrictions in the
way of the settlement of Europeans in the East should be removed, that
natives and Europeans should have equal opportunities of employment and
office, and should be under one law. The Bill was vehemently opposed
by Lord Ellenborough, but was carried by large majorities, and proved
to be the means of opening, in accordance with the principles of free
trade, an enormous market for English commerce, so that in ten years
the Chinese trade had doubled, and British exports to India and Ceylon
had increased from two to six millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emancipation of the slaves. Aug.</div>

<p>But the most important measure of the session was the Bill which
was passed on the 30th of August for the emancipation of the slaves.
The abolitionists had been successful in 1807 in putting an end to the
traffic in slaves, but though raised in value and lessened in number,
by means of smuggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1443" id="Page_1443">[1443]</a></span>
and of the natural increase of the race the supply of human cattle
had been kept up and slavery had continued. The Resolutions of
1823 had aimed at the gradual extinction of slavery, at alleviating
its worst horrors, and raising the slaves to a fitting condition to
receive freedom; but they had practically been inoperative: not
<span class="sidenote">Condition of trade in the West India
Islands.</span> only had they been continually thwarted by the
planters, but the discovery that they had rights, and that those rights
were acknowledged, caused a very natural uneasiness among the slaves,
and had added greatly to the difficulties under which the planters
laboured. Their position was constantly becoming worse. Injudicious
protection had been afforded to sugar, their chief production. Enormous
duties had been laid on it, with a preference always to the West Indian
and slave-grown article. During the war the monopoly of production had
fallen chiefly into their hands. They had been able to make enormous
profits. As a consequence, just as in the case of corn in England, the
cultivation of the sugar-cane had been carried on in the most reckless
fashion. Plantations were temporarily occupied only to be exhausted or
sold at a heavy loss, and fresh land taken in. In the midst of this
false prosperity, a wasteful expenditure and a total want of economy,
the natural consequences of easily-gotten wealth, had become prevalent;
the planters as a body had become deeply involved. The cessation of
the war had admitted other competitors to the market. The commercial
crisis in England had seriously affected the planters' credit, and
just as the greatest efforts would have been necessary to restore them
at all to their old state of prosperity, their supply of slaves was
diminished, it became more difficult to work their exhausted land,
and the Resolutions of 1823, and subsequent orders in Council, made
the employment of slave labour, which economists had long known to be
really an extravagant form of labour, more and more difficult. These
evils were naturally attributed to the abolitionists in England and to
the Government which had even partially listened to them. As long as
the unreformed Parliament existed, the West Indian interest was very
strong in the House, and the planters, who believed that with some
help from England, and with the management of the slaves left in their
own hands, they might yet retrieve their position, were not without
hopes. The accession of the Grey ministry was a heavy blow to them,
for a large section of the supporters of the Government were almost as
anxious for the abolition of slavery as for the passage of the Reform
Bill, and it was impossible that a ministry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1444" id="Page_1444">[1444]</a></span>
which Lord Brougham was the Chancellor, who had owed his last election
chiefly to the abolitionists' votes, should postpone the settlement of
the question long.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_OPPOSITION_OF_PLANTERS" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_OPPOSITION_OF_PLANTERS"></a>Opposition of the planters to the orders in
Council. 1831.</div>

<p>The conduct of the planters forced on the crisis. A new series of
orders in Council was issued in 1831 for the better and more merciful
management of the slaves, for the limitation of the hours of labour,
and for the establishment of official slave-overseers. All the
colonies except the Crown colonies, where but little difficulty was
met with, resented highly this interference with what they considered
their rights and property. The language of their assemblies became
disrespectful and almost rebellious. In Trinidad it was determined to
stop the payment of taxes till the order was repealed, while on the
other side the slaves in Jamaica burst into open rebellion, producing a
loss estimated at £1,000,000. In April 1831, a great meeting in London
declared that Government was liable for these losses, and claims were
sent in to the Colonial Secretary for damages caused by the measures
pursued by his Majesty's ministers. It was a sort of declaration of
war, which was brought to a point when, on the 17th of April, Lord
Harewood presented a petition from the West India interest begging for
a full inquiry into the laws, usages, and condition of the West Indian
colonies, and the possible future improvements, with due regard always
to the rights of private property. This was in the very heat of the
discussions on the Reform Bill. Bent upon his great measure, Lord Grey
could not afford to risk anything at the moment. He therefore not only
at once granted the committee, but allowed a sum of £100,000, which had
been voted for the relief of the colonies, to be raised to £1,000,000
on account of a late destructive hurricane. On the 24th of May Sir
Fowell Buxton, the leader of the abolitionists, brought the matter
before the Lower House, while the Chancellor presented a gigantic
petition, followed by many others, in favour of emancipation; for the
great crisis was now over, Wellington's efforts to form a Government
had proved futile, and the hope of the abolitionists were consequently
high. But, somewhat strangely, Lord Althorp could not be induced in
the Lower House to give up Canning's idea of gradual emancipation, and
moved and carried amendments upon Buxton's motion in favour of the
continuance of the policy of 1823. It must be remembered that the House
of Commons was still unreformed, and that the great Bill was not yet
carried.</p>

<p>With the change in the character of the House all prudential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1445" id="Page_1445">[1445]</a></span>
reasons for opposition on the part of the ministry disappeared, and
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTHREE_THE_BILL_PASSED" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTHREE_THE_BILL_PASSED"></a>The Emancipation Bill passed. Aug. 30,
1833.</span> the pressure brought to bear upon them had become
much stronger. They therefore now undertook the question, and the
appointment of Mr. Stanley to the Colonial Office insured the success
of the measure. It was not wholly satisfactory to the abolitionists. It
still bore traces of the lingering wish for gradual emancipation. All
children of slaves born after the passing of the Act, and all children
of six years of age and under, were declared free, but the rest of
the slaves were to serve a sort of apprenticeship; three-fourths of
their time was for a certain number of years to remain at the disposal
of the masters, the other fourth was their own, to be paid for at a
fixed rate of wages. The complete failure of the Resolutions of 1823
should have taught the Government the impossibility of this scheme.
The period of apprenticeship was shortened from twelve to seven years,
and subsequently, after a four years' trial, the plan was given up.
The second part of the Government scheme was the remuneration of the
planters by a loan of £15,000,000; but as Parliament regarded this as
much too small a boon, it was subsequently changed for the enormous
gift of £20,000,000. The vastness of the sum was held by many as
totally disproportionate to the loss of the planters; by others it
was thought that, as slavery was in itself contrary to all right, the
planters deserved no compensation for the loss of what they should
never have possessed. On the whole, however, it was thought better
that so great an act of justice should be generously completed, and
the great sacrifice was willingly made. Wilberforce, the father of the
movement, lived just long enough to bless God that the object of his
life had been reached; he heard the success of the second reading of
the Bill, and died a few days afterwards, on the 29th of July.</p>

Feb. 4, 1834.</div>

<p>Of the great questions of the day there still remained the
all-important one, the condition of the labouring classes, but it was
to another Prime Minister and to a modified Cabinet that the honour of
the introduction of the new Poor Law was to belong. In spite of their
large majorities, no single measure of the Government had been passed
without important modifications, no scheme had been introduced that
did not bear upon it the marks of compromise, and afford a distinct
proof of the inherent weakness of a Cabinet divided against itself. The
speech from the throne in the opening of the year 1834 did not give any
hope of a firmer and more united Government. The Duke of Wellington was
not wrong in complaining that there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1446" id="Page_1446">[1446]</a></span>
definite promise of a single Government Bill, that the foreign policy
of the Cabinet had not produced European peace, that in spite of its
majorities the Church policy of the Government had failed, and that
it had carefully avoided, even while vaunting the success which had
attended it, to state whether it intended the Coercion Bill to be
renewed in Ireland or not. Nor was it doubted that he was uttering the
opinions of some at least of the Cabinet itself when he warned the
Lords against the tendency visible in several of the late proceedings
of the Government towards tampering with property and the introduction
of the beginnings of the policy of confiscation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rejection of repeal, a Government victory.</div>



<p>In the Lower House both the strength and weakness of the Government
were shortly to be displayed. O'Connell, who had talked so long
about the repeal of the Union, and had thus kept up the agitation
which was so lucrative to himself, was compelled at length to make
good his promises and to introduce a substantive motion for repeal.
A lengthened debate followed, but terminated in a most complete
victory for the Government; the division showing a majority of 485
in favour of an amendment exactly contradicting O'Connell's motion.
The central position occupied by the Government enabled it, when it
occasionally joined heartily with one side or the other, still to
command the House of Commons, but when questions arose of a more
doubtful sort its weakness became visible. Measures for the relief of
Ireland had been promised, and Mr. Ward, a private member, determined
to bring these promises to a test, by introducing a motion (May 27)
with regard to the difficult question of the Irish Church, which
the ministers would gladly have left quiet. Mr. Ward's resolution
stated that the Protestant Episcopal Establishment of Ireland
<span class="sidenote">Ministerial difficulty on Mr. Ward's motion on
the Irish Church.</span> much exceeded the spiritual wants of the
Protestant population, that it was the right of the State and of
Parliament to distribute Church property, and that the temporal
possessions of the Irish Church ought to be reduced. This motion put
the Government into the greatest perplexity; to uphold the direct
negative was to resign its pretensions to be the party of progress;
to accept it was to shock some of its most important members. The
ministers determined to adopt a middle course, and appoint a commission
of inquiry. They hoped thereby to induce Mr. Ward to withdraw his
motion, because the question was already in Government hands, but they
seemed at the same time to pledge themselves to act in accordance with
the recommendations of the commission. Armed with this compromise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1447" id="Page_1447">[1447]</a></span>
Lord Althorp went to the House to meet Mr. Ward's motion. But the
seconder, Mr. Grote, had advanced but a short way in the speech when
the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose and said, that since the beginning
of the debate information had been brought to him which induced him to
beg for a postponement. His personal influence was so great that the
House at once granted his request. The news he had received was the
resignation of Mr. Stanley, the Colonial minister, and of Sir James
Graham, First Lord <span class="sidenote">Resignation of the most
conservative ministers.</span> of the Admiralty, who regarded any
interference with Church property with great abhorrence. They were
followed by the Duke of Richmond, Postmaster-General, and by Lord
Ripon, Privy Seal. The more conservative members of the Cabinet had
thus openly retired from it. It might have been expected that Lord
Durham, who had previously left it upon opposite grounds, would
have now returned to office, and the Government have assumed a more
distinctly radical character. He was, however, personally obnoxious to
such members of the party of Canning as still remained in office, and
his influence was dreaded by Lord Grey, who, though he continued as
yet to hold the Premiership in accordance with the generally expressed
desire of the Liberal party, sympathized at heart more with the Tories
than with the Radicals. He expressed his feelings in his answer to an
address which Lord Ebrington got up intreating him to retain his place.
"In pursuing," he said, "a course of salutary improvement I feel it
indispensable that we shall be allowed to proceed with deliberation
and caution; and, above all, that we should not be urged by a constant
and active pressure from without to the adoption of any measures
the necessity of which has not been fully proved, and which are not
strictly regulated by a careful attention to the settled institutions
of the country both in Church and State. On no other principle can this
or any other administration be conducted with advantage or safety." No
difficulty was found in filling the vacant places; Mr. Spring Rice, who
had distinguished himself in the debate on the Union, became Secretary
for the Colonies, and Lord Auckland succeeded Sir James Graham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties of Grey's position.</div>

<p>Under Lord Grey's leadership the Government was enabled to
continue its course, because it was recognized at the time
as the only possible Government; the Conservative feeling
in England was far too strong to allow the success of a Radical
Government with Durham at its head. On the other hand, on the
great questions of the day it was impossible to go back. Sir Robert
Peel clearly understood this position of affairs. He saw that a Tory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1448" id="Page_1448">[1448]</a></span>
Government would have no hope of permanence if it rested only on
the support of the extreme members of the party. If the party was
ever to be reconstituted it must loyally accept the changes which
had been made, admit within its limits the more conservative-minded
of the reformers, and take its stand on the great Conservative
instincts of the nation&mdash;the love of the State Church, and the
dread of any attack upon property. For the formation of a Liberal
Conservative Government the time had not yet arrived, and the present
Government of compromise was therefore allowed to continue. But the
difficulties of the Premier, from the divergence of his opinions from
those of his colleagues, soon became overwhelming. It was necessary
to determine whether the Coercion Bill should be renewed or not. But
it was possible to renew it in a softened form, and to omit the most
objectionable parts&mdash;the suppression of the right of petition and
the establishment of military courts. Such a course seemed advisable
to Mr. Littleton, the Chief Secretary, and recommended itself also to
the more liberal members of the Government, Lord Brougham and Lord
Althorp. The mischievous activity of Lord Brougham led him to suggest
to the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wellesley, who had succeeded Anglesey,
the advisability of officially informing the Government that he could
do without these stringent clauses. Wellesley had already expressed
himself privately to the contrary effect, but was overpersuaded,
and followed the advice of Littleton and Brougham in his official
despatches. These contradictory opinions from the chief of the
Government were naturally very embarrassing to Lord Grey. To make
matters worse, Littleton had attempted a personal reconciliation with
O'Connell. Lord Althorp had known and approved of this step, but had
warned Littleton against making any pledges. The Secretary unluckily
allowed himself to be drawn into an admission that neither himself nor
the Lord Lieutenant nor Lord Althorp approved of the renewal of the
obnoxious clauses. To complete his blunder, he did not inform Lord
Althorp what he had done, and trusted to a promise of secresy on the
part of O'Connell, the most untrustworthy of men. So strong was Lord
Althorp's opinion on the subject, backed as he believed it to be by
that of Wellesley and of Littleton, that after being outvoted in the
Cabinet, he in fact tendered his resignation, but was overruled by Lord
Grey.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July the Premier introduced the Bill in its full
form, asserting, as from Wellesley's private letters to him he had a
right to assert, that it was considered necessary by the Irish Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1449" id="Page_1449">[1449]</a></span>
On this, O'Connell, forgetful of his promise, disclosed in the
<span class="sidenote">Resignation of Grey's ministry. July 1834.</span>
Lower House his conversation with Littleton, which was in fact a direct
contradiction of Lord Grey's assertion, at the same time implicating
Lord Althorp in the deception played upon him. The Government seemed
convicted not only of internal division, but of duplicity. Lord
Grey reiterated his assertion in the Upper House with regard to the
feelings of the Irish Government as expressed to him, while Lord
Althorp admitted that he disliked the clause, and that Mr. Littleton
was justified in telling O'Connell that the question was unsettled
at the time of their conversation. The divergence of opinion in the
Cabinet was thus fully brought out, and Lord Althorp was made to appear
as guilty at once of having held out false hopes to O'Connell, and
of having waived his own opinions for the sake of retaining office.
Nothing could have been more alien to his nature than this charge,
especially as, far from having really pledged himself to O'Connell,
he had particularly warned Littleton against committing himself. But
there seemed no way of escape without rendering still more glaring the
weakness of the administration. On this ground, Littleton's offer to
resign, which he felt in honour bound to make, was rejected; but, when
in their eagerness to embarrass Government the Opposition moved for
the production of the private letters of the Cabinet, Lord Althorp, in
disgust at his equivocal position and at the attempted introduction
into Parliament of matters which he held to be wholly beyond its
jurisdiction, determined to resign. Lord Grey, by no means wedded to
office, and feeling that Althorp's personal influence was the main
security of the Government, at once declared the administration at an
end. The King had already shown, when giving an answer to an address
from the Bishops, a strong feeling against any attack upon the property
of the Church. This known division between the sovereign and his
advisers, and the evident weakness of the Cabinet itself, rendered the
resignation of the ministry less surprising than it otherwise would
have been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Melbourne's ministry. July 16.</div>

<p>Seeing the impossibility of forming a distinctly Tory ministry,
the King was persuaded by Lord Brougham to send for Lord Melbourne,
whom he instructed to give effect as far as possible to his previously
expressed wishes, and to form a combined ministry, admitting to office
some Tories and some of those who had left office on Conservative
grounds. The attempt was fruitless. Peel did not yet see his desired
opportunity, and foreseeing the gradual reaction which must arise from
the unsatisfactory character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1450" id="Page_1450">[1450]</a></span>
of the Whig administration, determined to await his time. The King was
therefore compelled to consent to the reconstruction under Melbourne
of the old ministry. There was very little change in the construction
of the Cabinet. Lord Melbourne's own place in the Home Department was
filled by Lord Duncannon (Ponsonby), Sir John Cam Hobhouse obtained a
seat in the Cabinet as First Commissioner of the Woods and Forests, and
Lord Carlisle surrendered the Privy Seal to Lord Mulgrave.</p>

<p>The change, such as it was, did not add to the strength of the
ministry. The introduction of the Coercion Bill on the 18th of
July, without the stringent clauses, seemed a confession that
some of the ministers at all events were acting contrary to conviction,
or that they had weakly yielded to Irish clamour. The
Bill was however passed with a strong protest in the Lords. An
attempt on the 29th of July again to settle the tithe question
displayed still further the inefficiency of the ministry; they allowed
themselves to be beaten in the Lower House upon an amendment
of O'Connell, who, instead of the proposed land tax, suggested
the immediate payment of the tithes, diminished forty per cent.,
by the landlord. In spite of their defeat, which so completely
changed their Bill that out of 172 clauses 111 had to be removed,
<span class="sidenote">Church policy of Melbourne's ministry.</span>
they proceeded with it, but suffered a heavy defeat on the second
reading in the Lords. Their Church policy was indeed throughout
entirely ineffective. The feeling that the Church was in danger
had begun to take hold not only of the Lords, who systematically
resisted innovation, but of the people in England. The efforts of
the Dissenters, excited to demand religious equality by the success
of Irish agitation, were fruitless. Their petitions were indeed of
a character to cause some fear. They begged for the separation of
Church and State, for the exclusion of Bishops from Parliament, for
the admission of Dissenters to all the privileges of the universities.
On this last point a Bill was introduced. Largely signed petitions
were sent in against it by the universities. All the leaders of the
Conservative, or partially Conservative party, combined to oppose it,
and though it passed the Lower House it was rejected in the Lords (Aug.
1). In the same way the efforts of Government to relieve Dissenters
from the Church rates, and from the restrictions laid upon the right of
dissenting ministers to celebrate marriage, being all conceived from a
Church point of view, and assuming the form of concessions rather than
the granting of rights, were distasteful to the Dissenters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1451" id="Page_1451">[1451]</a></span>
themselves, and came to nothing. The plan for the commutation of
the English tithes met with the same fate. It was indeed a period
of general ecclesiastical excitement; the introduction of the
appropriation clause in the Irish Tithe Bill had closely touched the
feelings of English Churchmen; the nature of the Church as distinct
from an institution founded by and connected with the State began to
be examined. A party in Oxford undertook to enlighten the nation upon
the character of the Church in a series of tracts, which gained for the
authors the title of Tractarians. In these they urged with great force
all the tenets of what is now known as the High Church party&mdash;the
doctrine of apolostic succession, the sole efficiency of the
sacraments, the sacred nature of the priesthood, and the insufficiency
of the Bible as apart from the explanations of Church tradition. Their
principles rapidly spread. At the same time the Evangelical party lost
several of its chief leaders and began to decline. And though three
parties could still be traced, public opinion began to divide itself
chiefly between the two great views of those who regarded the Church as
an institution independent in itself, and beyond the reach of secular
interference, and those Liberals who, attached as they might be to the
Church as a political institution, regarded it as lying within the
sphere of politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reform of the Poor Law. Aug. 1834.</div>

<p>But if their liberal Church policy was doomed to failure, the
ministry was able to do one great work by the reform of the Poor Law.
The chief effects of the old Poor Law have been already mentioned. Its
lax administration, the power of relief in the houses of the paupers,
the system of allowances in aid of wages, and the distribution of
relief in proportion to the number of children, had pauperized the
agricultural poor, had withdrawn the chief restraints on early and
imprudent marriages, had fostered immorality, and increased the amount
of the poor rate till it seemed as though England would sink beneath
the burden. It had become necessary to adopt some sounder principles,
even although they had the appearance of harshness. Nor was the
Government without experience by which to guide its action. Already in
about a hundred parishes an improved administration had been tried,
and in every instance it had succeeded; while, on the other hand, in
certain parishes where the old system remained in vigour cultivation
had been actually abandoned, and the neighbouring parishes having
to support their poor, there was every risk of the plague spreading
throughout England. The chief error in the old system was the complete
confusion which existed between poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1452" id="Page_1452">[1452]</a></span>
and pauperism, between the industrious poor man and the self-pauperized
idler. It was this point on which a commission issued in 1832 chiefly
insisted. The Bill based on their report was in fact little more than
a recurrence to the true principles enunciated in the first general
Poor Law of the reign of Elizabeth. To separate these two classes
it was necessary that outdoor relief should be discontinued and the
allowance system put an end to. Those only who were really in want were
to receive relief, but upon conditions which should render it certain
that the want was real. In the workhouse every able-bodied man must
work; it was not fair that the industrious should be called upon to
support an increasing race of paupers raised in the workhouse, husbands
and wives must therefore be separated; for the sake of training and
education, children must be kept from the possible contamination of
the adult paupers; and as the maintenance of industry was one of
the chief objects of the reform, free circulation of labour and the
removal of most of the restrictions of the old law of settlement were
indispensable. The system no doubt had a very harsh appearance, but
its principles could scarcely be questioned. But these principles
were in fact nothing new; all the evils to be rectified had arisen
from the bad way in which such principles had been carried out. The
machinery then by which relief was to be administered was of almost
more importance than the principles on which it was to be granted. For
economy, parishes were formed into unions, with one workhouse instead
of several. The method of collecting the rates was left unchanged,
the distribution was still left to guardians and select vestries; but
this local management was placed under a central board, consisting of
three commissioners, with assistants, at first twenty-one, diminished
subsequently to nine. There was one other point which bore an
appearance of extreme harshness, was much objected to at the time, and
was subsequently changed; this was an attempt to check immorality by
throwing the charge of the maintenance of illegitimate children upon
the mother. This appeared completely to shield the guilty father, and
to punish only the weak and misguided mother, but in fact, as many wise
people saw at the time, it roused a feeling of self-dependence and
respect among women, and produced the very best effects; the decrease
of illegitimate births was extraordinary. The decrease in England was
nearly 10,000, or thirteen per cent. in two years. In one point only
did it appear that party interests could interfere with the passage of
the Bill. It almost necessarily implied the subsequent repeal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1453" id="Page_1453">[1453]</a></span>
Corn Laws. Freedom of labour, the abolition of the Act of Settlement,
rendered such a change indispensable; but this the ministry, very
anxious to avoid the appearance of touching laws which were very dear
to the hearts of the agricultural interest, still refused to believe,
and denied in the most absolute terms. Nevertheless, between the second
reading on the 9th of May and the third reading of the Bill on the 1st
of July, a very powerful opposition had been aroused. It was spoken
of as a Bill cruel against the poor. From a radical point of view
the centralization of the system was decried. The commissioners were
spoken of as three-tailed Bashaws. It was however carried by 157 to 50
votes. This was on the 2nd of July, when Lord Grey was still in office.
Under the new ministry the management of the Bill in the Upper House
passed into the hands of Lord Brougham; he supported it in one of his
ablest speeches, and it was carried on the second reading by a very
considerable majority, and became law on the 14th of August. Although
some subsequent amendments were necessary, it has on the whole proved
highly successful. The poor rate, which at the end of the American
War, when the population of England was about 8,000,000, amounted to
£2,132,487, which during the subsequent forty years of mismanagement
had risen till in 1833, when the population was 14,000,000, it had
reached £8,606,501, was in the course of three years reduced by upwards
of £3,000,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discontent and misery of the poor.</div>

<p>But though its character was so free from taint of party, though
its action was on the whole so beneficial, the new Poor Law was used,
and used with effect, to excite the deep-felt discontent which was
prevalent in the lower classes, and which continued to increase and
to acquire form and organization during the next four years, till it
assumed the definite form of Chartism, and produced the very dangerous
outbreak in the year 1839. It was scarcely possible but that such
discontent should exist; the hopes of the poor man, raised to an
exaggerated height by the excitement of the Reform Bill, had been
cruelly disappointed. While no doubt some good and useful measures of
reform had been carried, it was impossible to deny that the reform
ministry had on the whole proved itself unwilling and unable to handle
the great social questions of the time, that disputes in Parliament had
fallen back into their old grooves, and had assumed the form of party
contests rather than of efforts for the improvement of the great mass
of the people. Hitherto trade had been fairly prosperous, but in 1835
symptoms were evident that this prosperity was disappearing; and when want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1454" id="Page_1454">[1454]</a></span>
was added to the justly-felt disappointment of the workmen, when
agitators were exciting them with dismal stories of the cruelty of
the Poor Law, of the tyranny of the manufacturing masters, and when
every good and popular measure seemed to be first stripped of half its
value by the ministry which introduced it, and then totally rejected
by an obstructive House of Lords, it is not to be wondered at that the
unrepresented masses believed that they had been used merely as an
instrument, and that if increased representation was so good for their
betters, it would prove the cure for them also, and began to clamour
for a wide extension of the franchise, and more efficient security that
the particular wants of their class should receive attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increase of trades unions.</div>

<p>Many signs of the growing discontent were visible. The most
formidable in the course of the year 1834 was the great extension
and changed character of the trades unions. For some time trade
societies had existed, and from time to time individual trades had
combined to strike for advance of wages or other trade purposes, but
in this year a combination of many trades began to make itself seen,
which by mutual support should enable those on strike to hold out
against their masters, and though the system broke down through the
natural inefficiency of an uneducated body for such a combination, the
danger became great when it was extended to the agricultural poor. To
repress this symptom, so threatening to the landowners and farmers,
six labourers were indicted at Dorchester under an obsolete statute
against the administering of oaths. Amidst much popular sympathy,
they were sentenced to seven years' transportation. The whole body
of unionists, in their indignation, summoned a general meeting in
Copenhagen Fields on the 21st of April. Besides a general intention to
overawe the ministry, there seems to have been among a knot of their
leaders a distinct plan of somehow or other securing the Government
by violent means. It was intended that the deputation of the trades
should lay hands upon Lord Melbourne, who was then minister for home
affairs, and proceed to further acts of violence. Warned in time,
Melbourne kept himself out of sight, and sent his under secretary to
receive the deputation, while silently troops were held in readiness,
the public offices defended with artillery, and 5000 householders
sworn in as special constables. The under secretary declared that a
petition accompanied by 60,000 men could not be received, and seeing
the preparations made for their reception, the crowd withdrew in quiet,
and the day passed over safely, but the incident shows both the power
and temper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1455" id="Page_1455">[1455]</a></span>
unionists. Even more formidable was the general feeling against the
House of Lords which exhibited itself at the close of the next year. By
that time the House had shown itself still more obstinate, and facts
had been brought to light which rendered it particularly odious to the
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dispute between Durham and Brougham.</div>



<p>In the autumn of 1834 the possession of office by the Whigs was
regarded as secure, and while O'Connell returned to continue the
agitation in Ireland, the ministers withdrew as usual to refresh
themselves after the labours of the session. Among others, Lord
Brougham travelled in Scotland, everywhere bringing both himself
and the ministry into ridicule by his inconsistent and egotistical
speeches. On the 15th of September the late Prime Minister attended
a banquet held in his honour at Edinburgh, where he met Lord Durham,
his son-in-law, Lord Brougham, and several of the other ministers.
In returning thanks for the health of the ministry, the Chancellor
appeared to rebuke the reformers for their impatience and for
endangering all progress by their haste. These words by no means suited
the views of Lord Durham, one of the chief authors of the Reform Bill,
and a man of very popular tendencies. He replied that he entirely
disagreed with his noble and learned friend, and frankly confessed
that he was one of those persons who saw with regret every hour that
passed over the existence of recognized and unreformed abuses. Brougham
took this rebuke in the highest dudgeon, and in a very few days, at
Salisbury, he replied severely upon Lord Durham, and uttered a sort of
challenge to him to meet him in the House of Lords, and shortly after
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> charged him with revealing the secrets of
the Cabinet. Lord Durham's words at Edinburgh were eagerly accepted
as proofs of a more frank acceptance of the principles of reform than
they had hitherto met with from Government, and all minds were eagerly
set upon the approaching duel in the House. But the King, who, as has
been already mentioned, much disliked the Church policy of the Whigs,
dreaded what must have given rise to a new
<span class="sidenote">Dismissal of the Melbourne ministry. Nov. 1834.</span>
assertion of the duty of rapid reform. He was eager to prevent the
meeting in the House, and circumstances favoured him. Before the
session Lord Spencer died, and Lord Althorp, his son, was thus removed
to the Upper House. There was no reason why this should have broken
up the ministry, but the King seized his opportunity, sent for Lord
Melbourne, asserted that the ministry rested chiefly on the personal
influence of Lord Althorp in the Commons, declared that, deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1456" id="Page_1456">[1456]</a></span>
of it as it now was, the Government could not go on, and dismissed
his ministers, instructing Melbourne at once to send for the Duke of
Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peel-Wellington ministry.</div>

<p>Ever since the passing of the Reform Bill the conduct of Sir Robert
Peel had been extremely judicious. In his hands the Tory party had
been entirely remodelled; there were indeed remnants of it unchanged,
especially in the House of Lords, but gradually most of the party had
separated themselves from this remnant, and had taken the name of
Conservatives, declaring themselves as willing as the Whigs to foster
reforms, although only in a Conservative manner. It was in vain that
the old Tories had sought to keep the Duke of Wellington with them; he
had wisdom enough to see that the hope of the party lay with Peel, and
to keep up the closest connection with him. His first step therefore,
when summoned by the King, was to send to Peel, who, believing that
the time for a Conservative ministry had not yet arrived, had gone
abroad, and was now in Rome. While waiting for his arrival, the Duke
took upon himself the discharge of no less than five offices, conduct
which, though in fact perfectly wise and reasonable, was foolishly
complained of at the time as unconstitutional. Peel, although he was
as yet by no means anxious for office, could not but obey the summons,
and hurried home with extreme rapidity. He had hoped to obtain the
support of Sir James Graham and Mr. Stanley, the late deserters from
the Whig ministry, and it was a grave disappointment when they refused
to act with him. Thus prevented from forming the moderate Conservative
ministry he intended, Peel was reduced to fill his places with men of
more pronounced opinions, which promised ill for any advance in reform.
He himself became Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the
Treasury. The Foreign, Home, War, and Colonial Offices were filled
respectively by Wellington, Goulburn, Herries, and Aberdeen. Lord
Lyndhurst became Lord Chancellor, Hardinge Irish Secretary, and Lord
Wharncliffe Privy Seal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_THE_TAMWORTH_MANIFESTO" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTY_THE_TAMWORTH_MANIFESTO"></a>The Tamworth Manifesto. Jan. 1835.</div>

<p>With this ministry Peel had to meet a hostile House of Commons,
for the approach of the Conservatives to power had combined Whigs
and Radicals in opposition. The Prime Minister therefore thought it
necessary to dissolve Parliament, and took the opportunity of declaring
his policy in what is known as the Tamworth Manifesto. He declared his
acceptance of the Reform Bill as a final settlement of the question,
and promised to carry out its intentions as far as they consisted in a
wise and careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1457" id="Page_1457">[1457]</a></span>
improvement of old institutions. As to the other questions then at
issue he would support the inquiry into the state of corporations which
the late ministry had set on foot, and wished, as his predecessors
had done, to relieve Dissenters from the Church rates and from all
restrictions on their marriages; but upon the Irish Church, and upon
admission of Dissenters to the universities, his mind was unchanged.
He continued to object to the appropriation of Church revenues to
secular purposes and to granting degrees to Dissenters. As to whether
any reform was required in the organization of the English Church, his
mind, he said, was not yet made up. The tone of this Manifesto was very
different from that of the old Tory party, and shows that the Reform
Bill had really done its work, that the country had entered upon a new
era, when the lines between parties would be less coarsely drawn, when
obstinate obstruction to all reform would be impossible, and the points
at issue confined chiefly to the time, manner, and degree, in which
reforms should be carried out. But it is impossible in a country where
party government has once taken root that unprejudiced discussion of
measures should become prevalent. The general principles of the men
by whom the measures are suggested are, and must be, invariably taken
into consideration, and the one party will not fail to feel mistrust of
the other even though the plans suggested are as good, or better, than
their own, and the contest between the rival parties for the Government
of the country will not cease. Thus, in spite of Peel's moderation,
the whole body of the Liberals were determined to oppose the new
Government to the utmost, and not to trust the administration in the
hands of one who had always represented the Tories, and who
<span class="sidenote">New Parliament. Feb. 19, 1835.</span> still
received the support even of the extreme members of that party. The
elections, though they returned a House, as is generally the case,
more favourable to the existing Government than that which had been
dissolved, still gave a considerable majority to the Liberals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overthrow of Peel's ministry. April 8, 1835.</div>

<p>From the very first Peel held office upon suffrance; the only
question was how to bring matters to a point, as the minister refused
to accept as his dismissal anything but a direct vote of want of
confidence. Meanwhile his temper and judgment daily increased the
admiration which the public began to feel for him. He took up several of
the late ministers' measures, and carried them through where they
themselves had failed. A more complete liberty granted to the Dissenters
with regard to their marriages won their approbation; and though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1458" id="Page_1458">[1458]</a></span>
could not complete this measure, he was able on going out of office to
leave it in the hands of Lord John Russell, by whom it was settled upon
the principle that the State was only interested in the civil contract,
while churches and sects were at liberty to add what religious
ceremonies they liked. He introduced a measure for the voluntary
commutation of tithes, which seemed to be successful, re-appointed
all the committees of the preceding session for examining abuses,
and continued with good effect the ecclesiastical commission for the
organization of the arrangements of the Church. The common charge
against him was that he was purloining the measures of his adversaries.
However, although he had to stand constantly on the defensive, there
appeared no sufficient grounds for a vote of want of confidence. At
last, on the 30th of March, Lord John Russell brought the matter to a
crisis by proposing as a sort of test question that the House should
resolve itself into committee to consider the state of the Irish
Church, with the intention of applying any surplus revenues which might
be found to general education, without distinction of religion. In
other words, he reintroduced the old appropriation clause. It is to
be borne in mind that the Whigs themselves had abandoned that clause,
that they had voted against it in the case of Mr. Ward's measure, and
that they afterwards entirely rejected it. But for the time it served
the party purpose. Although Peel declared, and declared rightly, that
the feeling of England was against it, the votes of the Scotch and
Irish members carried the day, and the ministry was beaten on the 3rd
of April by a majority of thirty-three. On the 8th Sir Robert Peel
announced his resignation.</p>

<p>The Whigs were thus again triumphant. The history of their weakness
and their difficulties belong to a period of history which lies beyond
the limits of this work. But one measure which they brought to a
satisfactory conclusion requires mention as completing in one very
important point the work of the Reform Bill. This was the reform of
corporations. With this exception it would be impossible to describe
the course of their measures without following them so far that they
become a part rather of present politics than of past history. But
this reform to which they at once pledged themselves was scarcely less
important for the purification of local government than the Reform Bill
itself had been with regard to the central Legislature.</p>

<p>On the extension of the franchise on the passing of the Reform
Bill, attention had been drawn to the fact that in a great number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1459" id="Page_1459">[1459]</a></span>
corporate towns many of the electors who had the right to join in
<span class="sidenote">Condition of municipal corporations.</span>
choosing members for Parliament had no voice at all in the management
of their own local affairs. It was clearly for the interest of the
reform party to remove this abuse, and to secure still stronger
support from the middle class of citizens among whom their strength
already lay. In 1833 a commission of ten members had been issued to
inquire into the condition of the corporations of England and Wales.
Nominated during the first days of the popular triumph, and with a
party object, it was natural that the commissioners should be drawn
entirely from the ranks of the reformers. Their report was therefore
open to the charge of onesidedness, but it brought a state of things
to light which thoroughly justified the Government in introducing a
great measure of reform. The constitution, originally popular, of the
English boroughs had in lapse of time been completely altered. The
rights of citizenship, originally belonging to all fully qualified
freemen residing within the borough, had been gradually confined to
a small class technically spoken of as the Freemen, many of whom
were so decayed as not only to pay no rates, but in some cases to be
themselves dependent on the poor rates. The government of the town and
administration of the corporate property, and, before the Reform Bill,
the election of parliamentary representatives, had in some instances
fallen into the hands of an exclusive council, who had the right of
filling up the vacancies in its own numbers. A variety of circumstances
had contributed to these changes. Birth, marriage, apprenticeship, or
membership of some guild, originally tests of residence, had after a
time acted so as to exclude large numbers of residents from the ranks
of the freemen. Wealth introduced a division of classes, and unchecked
encroachment on the part of the wealthy had gone still further to
exclude many from their rights. Political reasons had induced the Crown
to seek the support of the boroughs in Parliament, and, especially in
the time of the Tudors, new charters had been granted which placed
the local government entirely in the hands of self-elected councils,
much more easily handled for political purposes than widespread
constituencies. The same process had been continued by the Stuarts.
James II. even went further, and his attempt to nominate corporations
of boroughs was not the least of the causes of the Revolution. Though
the project failed, the close corporation system was continued both
by Whigs and Tories, who found their political advantage in it. This
perversion of municipal arrangements for political purposes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1460" id="Page_1460">[1460]</a></span>
been attended with many practical abuses. In the first place, the
corporations, which had in their hands the government of large and
important towns, by no means represented the property, intelligence, or
population of those towns. Thus in Ipswich, of 2000 ratepayers only 287
belonged to the corporation. At Cambridge, out of 20,000 inhabitants,
only 118 were freemen, while of the property, which was valued at
£25,000, only £2100 was the property of freemen. In Norwich, £25,500
was the value of the rated property, £18,200 of this belonged to those
who were not freemen. Again, these self-elected governors constantly
misappropriated the corporate funds, which, as the gross income of the
corporations was £366,000, was a matter of considerable importance; the
corporate offices were filled by favour, the charities employed for the
purchase of votes, and large sums spent upon feasting and other useless
shows, while the townsmen at large were rated for all local purposes.
The distribution of these rates again was in the hands of the same
people who exacted them, and no account of how they were employed could
be obtained. To cure this general state of corruption was the intention
of the new measure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Municipal Reform Bill. Sept. 7, 1835.</div>

<p>The measure included 178 boroughs. It began by marking out their
boundaries, where possible in accordance with the boundaries of the
electoral borough. The object of the Bill was not to centralize, but
on the contrary to improve local administration; it was not therefore
proposed to withdraw business from the hands of the corporation, with
the exception of the administration of charities and church funds,
which were respectively placed in the hands of trustees named by
the Lord Chancellor and of the ecclesiastical commissioners. It was
the nature of the corporation itself which was to be improved. In
accordance with the principle of the Whig party, the new governing
bodies were to be elected by constituencies of considerable breadth,
but confined to the middle classes. A three years' residence and
payment of the poor and borough rates was to be the qualification of an
elector. By them the new governing body, called the town council, was
chosen, which together with the constituency formed the corporation. To
committees of the town council were intrusted the administration of the
various branches of local government. To the whole body collectively
was given the management of the borough funds, the proper expenditure
of which was to be guaranteed by a publication of the accounts,
properly audited by auditors not themselves town councillors. The
Government reserved in its own hand the right of appointing justices of
the peace and paid magistrates when required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1461" id="Page_1461">[1461]</a></span>
Though the change was sweeping, and seemed somewhat to affect the
rights of property, the abuses were so glaring that the Bill easily
passed the Lower House. In the Lords several amendments were passed
against the Government, especially one retaining their old privilege to
existing freemen, but somewhat to the disappointment of the Tories, the
Commons accepted the amendment, and the Bill was passed on the 7th of
September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign diplomacy of Palmerston.</div>

<p>So absorbing had been the interest of domestic questions that
foreign affairs had been somewhat disregarded. Yet from time to time
they had come before the public attention, and were in themselves of
considerable importance. They had fallen chiefly into the hands of
Lord Palmerston, a disciple of Canning's, and therefore by principle
an upholder of peace and of the doctrine of non-intervention, but
inspired also as his master had been with an admiration and love for
the institutions of constitutional monarchy, which led him into a
line of conduct which it is difficult to harmonize with his professed
principles. The most striking characteristic of our foreign policy in
his hands was the close apparent union with France in opposition to the
three Eastern powers, which Palmerston still regarded as tainted with
the old principle of the Holy Alliance, and of one of which, namely
Russia, he was sensitively mistrustful on all points connected with the
policy of the East of Europe. The sympathy between England and France
was inevitable. In some sense the kings of the two countries were
both citizen kings, the great change which had taken place in England
was the counterpart of the Revolution of July. In both countries it
was the middle class which had just obtained the predominance. In
both countries there was the same character of government, and both
expressed the same desire for peace. At the same time the questions
which agitated Western Europe were all more or less connected with
the establishment of that form of government which both countries
admired.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_ABSORPTION_OF_POLAND" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYONE_ABSORPTION_OF_POLAND"></a>Absorption of Poland. 1831.</div>

<p>The influence of the Revolution of July had, as has been mentioned,
spread far and wide over Europe, but had made itself most prominently
felt in Belgium, which had broken loose from its enforced connection
with Holland, and in Poland, which rose in insurrection to free itself
from the rule of Russia. With Poland England had little to do. In the
existing state of circumstances, though the sympathy of all classes was
strongly with the Poles, armed interference was not to be thought of,
and it was impossible to prevent the total subjugation of that gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1462" id="Page_1462">[1462]</a></span>
nation, after a very brave but ineffectual attempt to withstand
the might of Russia. The fall of Warsaw sealed its fate; it was
incorporated, contrary to all the stipulations of the Treaty of Vienna,
with the Russian empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of Belgium.</div>

<p>But Belgium was nearer home. Its creation into a strong kingdom
had been the pet scheme of English diplomatists; it was impossible to
leave it to be overwhelmed by Holland, in conjunction with the Eastern
powers, or to be absorbed by France. The difficult duty of the English
minister was so to undo the work of his predecessors as if possible to
prevent a war which would inevitably have arisen in either of the above
cases, and so to preserve the independence of the Belgians that they
might yet serve in some degree to fulfil the object of the negotiators
of Vienna, as a check upon the power of France. To gain these ends he
induced the five great powers to send representatives to a Congress in
London. The first difficulty was to restrain the ambitious desires of
France, where the propagandist and conquering spirit seemed for the
moment to have been reawakened by the late revolution. The original
plan of mediation was rejected by the King of the Netherlands, who,
trusting to the assistance of Russia, invaded Belgium, and was only
dislodged by the appearance of a French army. After a period of some
anxiety, the firmness of Palmerston was successful in causing the
withdrawal of the French troops, and the rejection of the crown by
the King's son the Duc de Nemours. The immediate danger of war being
thus averted, the London Conference drew up twenty-four articles (Nov
15, 1831), on which, though they were not thoroughly acceptable to
either party, it was determined to insist. They specified the limits
of the new kingdom more favourably for Holland than had been the case
in the preceding and rejected scheme, and settled the division of the
public debt. Upon the understanding that these arrangements were final,
Prince Leopold, the husband of the late Princess Charlotte, accepted
the throne, not however, as Palmerston was careful to explain, as the
English candidate, but as a man generally acceptable to the powers. He
shortly rendered his position more secure by marrying a daughter of
the French King. But the difficulties did not end with his acceptance
of the throne; the King of the Netherlands continued to refuse the
proferred terms, till at length the two Western powers lost patience,
and unable to procure the assistance of the other members of the
Conference, took the matter into their own hands, laid an embargo on
the Dutch ships, blockaded the mouth of the Scheldt, and laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1463" id="Page_1463">[1463]</a></span>
siege to Antwerp with a French army. After a very gallant defence,
Antwerp yielded, and though the final settlement between the countries
was postponed till 1839, a provisional armistice was entered into which
practically put an end to the difficulties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affairs of Portugal.</div>

<p>As important as Belgium were the affairs of Portugal and Spain.
Don Miguel had pursued his career of cruelty and folly. Acts of
unjustifiable violence committed on the subjects of France had
compelled the French Government, in July 1831, to send a squadron to
the Tagus to obtain satisfaction, a measure which threatened for an
instant serious consequences, as the English Government still felt
itself pledged to uphold Portugal, its old ally. Fortunately Miguel
was too foolish to see his opportunity. Still worse behaviour towards
some English subjects brought a British fleet to Portugal in the
following spring also to demand satisfaction. It became certain that
the two Western powers would act in union there as they had already
done in Belgium. While continuing nominally a strict neutrality, all
sorts of volunteer assistance was allowed to join Don Pedro, when in
July 1832 he landed at Oporto, again to assert the claims of his young
daughter. An Englishman commanded his fleet, a Frenchman his army, and
his troops were largely composed of volunteers from both nations. On
the other hand, the French Legitimists, with Marshal Bourmont at their
head, crowded to assist Don Miguel. For a while Don Pedro's expedition
met with poor success; he could barely make good his position in
Oporto, but in the middle of the next year, Admiral Sartorius having
given place to Napier, the tide of victory changed, Miguel's fleet was
destroyed off St. Vincent, and before the end of June Lisbon was in the
hands of the Queen's adherents. For some while longer the strife was
continued; but the Whigs could boast that the question was practically
settled, and constitutional government established, although the
assertion they made that they had held a strict neutrality, and without
helping either side had allowed them to fight the matter out, was
scarcely consistent with truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTWO_AFFAIRS_OF_SPAIN" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYTWO_AFFAIRS_OF_SPAIN"></a>Affairs of Spain.</div>

<p>The success of constitutional principles in Portugal was speedily
followed by events which produced the same results in Spain. The
law of succession in that country had been again and again changed;
the liberal constitution of 1812 had excluded females; Ferdinand in
1830 had again admitted them to the succession, but, frightened by a
dangerous illness, and under pressure from the priests, he subsequently
withdrew this decree, thus leaving his brother Don Carlos, an extreme
absolutist, heir to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1464" id="Page_1464">[1464]</a></span>
throne. The return of health brought him under other influences. He
had married a young Neapolitan Princess, Christina, by whom he had
two daughters, and through her influence he was induced, in 1832,
to re-establish the old law, settling the crown on his daughter
Isabella. In September 1832 he died, and when Isabella was proclaimed
Queen and Christina Regent, Carlos met with considerable sympathy,
especially among the clergy, the peasantry and the old nobility, as
they considered him tricked out of his inheritance by Christina's
influence. But Christina had sense enough to throw herself heartily
upon the side of the Liberal government, and rallied round her all
the friends of constitutionalism in Spain and elsewhere. Thus there
were in each of the neighbouring countries of the Peninsula a young
Queen representing constitutional principles, opposed to an uncle with
absolutist views claiming the throne. The Queen was successful in
Spain; the Cortes was summoned under a Liberal minister, and Don Carlos
was driven from the country. The similarity of their positions made the
cause of the two Princes one, and Carlos betook himself to Don Miguel,
who was still after his expulsion from Lisbon lying at Santarem. Lord
Palmerston saw in this position of affairs an opportunity for carrying
out his great object, of supporting constitutionalism and aiming a blow
against the absolute powers of the East. He arranged, early in the
year 1834, a Quadruple Alliance, primarily between Spain and Portugal,
for the purpose of expelling the claimants to both countries from the
Peninsula, a movement which was to be supported in case of necessity by
a French army and an English fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYFOUY_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE" id="EIGHTEEN_THIRTYFOUY_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE"></a>The Quadruple Alliance. 1834.</div>

<p>Thus, as in the affairs of Belgium, France and England had been
successful in thwarting the Eastern powers and establishing a
constitutional power, so now again they had induced Spain and Portugal
to add their weight to the constitutional cause. "I reckon this to
be a great stroke," said Palmerston; "in the first place it will
settle Portugal, and go some way to settle Spain also, but what is of
more permanent and essential importance, it establishes a quadruple
alliance between the States of the West, which will serve as a powerful
counterpoise to the Holy Alliance of the East." The treaty did in
fact at once put an end to the opposition of Don Miguel. A Spanish
army marched to attack him on the rear, and he surrendered, and
promised to leave the Peninsula. In the affairs of Spain the treaty
was not so effectual. Don Carlos escaped in an English ship, to return
subsequently and carry on a civil war, which lasted till 1840. During
that period the English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1465" id="Page_1465">[1465]</a></span>
though still preserving external neutrality, allowed an English legion,
under the command of Sir De Lacy Evans, to go to the assistance of
the Queen, whose final triumph he materially assisted in gaining.
The whole fruit of the Whig foreign policy, and of the friendship
with France, which the similarity of feeling in the two countries had
engendered, was to consolidate for the time the West of Europe upon
constitutional principles, in well-defined opposition to the East. But
this had not been done without the exertion of an amount of influence,
and an indirect employment of physical force, which could
scarcely be honestly veiled under the name of neutrality; nor had
the joint influence of the two countries been sufficient to check the
<span class="sidenote">Unavailing against Russian advance.</span>
growth of Russia in the East. Mahomet Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, had
formed the idea of creating an Arabian monarchy from portions of the
Turkish Empire. His adopted son and heir, Ibrahim Pasha, overran the
whole of Syria, and, in 1832, seemed on the highroad to Constantinople.
In its extremity the Porte applied to Russia for assistance, and
although the French Ambassador contrived a temporary arrangement with
the Pasha which postponed for a time the interference of the Russians,
the further advance of Ibrahim compelled a renewed demand for help, and
finally, on July 8, 1833, most of the demands of Mahomet
<span class="sidenote">Treaty of Unkiar Skelesi.</span> Ali were
granted, and the Treaty of Unkiar Skelesi was signed with Russia, which
opened the Bosphorus to the Russians, and closed the Dardanelles to
the ships of war of other nations; the protests of England and France
remained entirely unheeded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Retrospect of affairs in India.</div>

<p>Palmerston's dislike to the advance of Russia in the East rested
not only on his general antipathy to the prince, whom he regarded as
the head of the absolutist party, but arose from the feeling that it
was necessary to secure our road to India, which has been the chief
spring of the policy of England in the Mediterranean, and indeed, that
nothing should interfere with our Indian possessions, became yearly
more important. Uninfluenced in its general course by the changes of
parties, the Indian Empire had been steadily increasing for the last
thirty years. Though Wellesley's view stated broadly, that England
must be the one great power of India, was not accepted by several of
his successors, without wish of their own they had been compelled to
act much as he would have acted, constantly to increase the English
dominions, and to complete the system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1466" id="Page_1466">[1466]</a></span>
subsidiary treaties with those powers which were still allowed a
separate existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_LORD_MINTO" id="EIGHTEEN_SEVEN_LORD_MINTO"></a>Lord Minto. 1807&mdash;1813.</div>

<p>Lord Cornwallis' second tenure of office, interrupted by his speedy
death, was too brief to allow him to reverse his predecessor's policy,
as seems to have been his intention. Nor was the government of Sir
George Barlow, one of the civil servants of the Company, who devoted
himself chiefly to the financial business of his office, of sufficient
length to produce much effect. But during the rule of Lord Minto, sent
out to replace him by the Grenville administration in 1807, some events
of importance took place. Of these the most important were the capture
of the Dutch and French possessions in the East, the check which was
given to the rising kingdom of the Sikhs in the Punjaub, and the
strange incident of a mutiny of the English officers in Madras. In July
<span class="sidenote">Capture of Batavia and Mauritius.</span> of
Bourbon was taken with little loss, and in the following November,
General Abercrombie, with an expedition consisting of troops from
Bengal and Madras, attacked the Isle of France; within three days of
his reaching the island he succeeded in overcoming all opposition,
the island was surrendered, and the last remnant of French power in
the East disappeared. In February of the same year the possessions of
Holland, then forming a part of the French Empire, were also attacked,
and in 1811 a considerable army was landed in Java. Batavia at once
surrendered, but it was not till after a severe battle with the Dutch
General Jansens, and the loss of about a thousand men, that the island
was subdued; it was intrusted to the government of Mr. Raffles,
afterwards Sir Stamford, and was much improved under his hands, but at
the Peace of Vienna it was restored with most other colonial conquests.
It has been believed that its value and wealth were not thoroughly
known or appreciated by the ministry at the time. It was the interest
of the European war also which brought Lord Minto's government into
contact with powers on the north-east of India. A French embassy
to Persia, 1810 the Island <span class="sidenote">Check of the
Sikhs.</span> really directed against the Russians, was thought to have
reference to an intended attack upon India, which was known to have
been at an earlier time a favourite project of Napoleon's. It became
therefore necessary for the English Government to attempt to secure the
friendship of the Affghans and the Sikhs. This latter race, originally
organized in a sort of confederacy, had been gradually brought under
the subjection of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1467" id="Page_1467">[1467]</a></span>
family, the representative of which was now Runjeet Singh. In
their dread of the French, the English were for a while blind to
his encroachments even on the east of the Sutlej, but as events in
Europe showed that Napoleon's Eastern dreams were for the present
over, a firmer tone was adopted, and in 1809 the appearance of
English troops proved to Runjeet that his hopes of further conquest
were futile, and he consented to enter into a treaty of perpetual
friendship. The mutiny at Madras was somewhat similar to that
which Clive had suppressed in the Bengal army. The withdrawal of
<span class="sidenote">Mutiny at Madras.</span> an allowance known
as the tent contract was the immediate cause of the disaffection,
but there had been for some time discontent among the officers,
unfortunately supported by some whose age and position gave them
influence over their juniors. General Macdowell, having been refused
a seat in the Council, had thrown up his command, and was returning
to England in disgust. He entered into an unseemly quarrel with the
Quartermaster-General, Colonel Munro, and published a general order
declaring that had he remained in India he would have brought him
to a court-martial. The Government, in great anger, suspended those
officers who had assisted in publishing the general order, and finding
them largely supported by their fellow-officers, proceeded to remove a
considerable number from their command. This was followed by an open
mutiny which broke out in Hyderabad, Seringapatam, and elsewhere. At
Seringapatam the mutineers were suppressed by force of arms, elsewhere
they came to their senses, and accepted the conditions imposed on
them by Lord Minto, who had come to Madras to attempt to meet the
difficulty. Lord Minto returned to England in 1813, after an honourable
discharge of his duties, and was succeeded by the Earl of Moira,
afterwards Marquis of Hastings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_WAR_WITH_NEPAUL" id="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN_WAR_WITH_NEPAUL"></a>War with Nepaul.</div>

<p>It was during Lord Moira's administration that the work of Wellesley
was completed and the position of England rendered absolutely paramount
in India. His first difficulties were with Nepaul, where the Goorkhas
had succeeded in establishing a power of some importance, and had not
refrained from attacking English territory. The war was a severe one;
on more than one occasion the English troops were defeated or foiled by
the strong fortifications of their opponents. But after two campaigns,
in 1815, Sir David Ochterlony succeeded in securing the hill-fortresses
and compelling the Goorkha chief to come to terms. The Nepaulese
surrendered to the English a portion of the Terrai, a territory lying
to the south of their country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1468" id="Page_1468">[1468]</a></span>
reinstated a considerable number of the small princes they had lately
dispossessed, and received an English resident at Catmandoo, their
capital. It was at the close of this war that Lord Moira received
his marquisate. But events, to which Lord Hastings owes his chief
celebrity, arose in a more important quarter. The centre of India
was occupied by the great princes of the Mahratta nation, who,
though subdued by Lord Wellesley, were uneasy under their altered
circumstances, and were dreaming of the restoration of their national
greatness. Their nominal head was the Peishwa resident at Poonah,
and now placed under a subsidiary treaty with the English. These
princes kept up communications among themselves. Agents from Poonah
were at all their courts, and some of them certainly engaged
<span class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_FIFTEEN_WAR_WITH_THE_PINDARIES" id="EIGHTEEN_FIFTEEN_WAR_WITH_THE_PINDARIES"></a>War with the Pindaries and Mahrattas.</span>
in intrigues both with the Nepaulese and Runjeet Singh, the late
enemies of the English. Besides these covert and dangerous enemies,
there existed a body of freebooters called the Pindaries. Recruited
from all nations and all religions, their hordes found employment
sometimes with the armies of the native princes at war with each other,
sometimes in predatory excursions of their own. The reward for which
they served was nearly always the right to rob. Their expeditions were
of the most destructive character; all mounted and lightly armed, they
crossed the country in marches of from forty to fifty miles a day, fell
upon the devoted district, and carried off everything moveable in it,
frequently burning what they could not carry away, and having recourse
to the cruellest tortures to wring from the wretched inhabitants
a knowledge of their hidden treasure. They had found their chief
support among the Mahrattas, and had established themselves in the
country between the Nerbudda and the Vindhya hills. Till 1815 they had
refrained from attacking the English, but during the Nepaulese war they
had crossed the river into the Deccan, and had ravaged the territory of
our ally the Nizam; and the year after they had even passed the British
frontiers and plundered more than three hundred villages. Lord Hastings
determined to put an end to these robbers, supported as he believed
that they were by the Mahratta confederation, before he dismissed the
army collected for the war of Nepaul. He applied for leave to act on
a great scale, and, having received it, brought into the field large
armies from all the Presidencies, and prepared for war on such a scale
as rendered it plain that he intended to make a final settlement
of Central India. It was the complicity of the Mahrattas with the
Pindaries which rendered his work difficult. The Peishwa had already
shown his intentions. His favourite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1469" id="Page_1469">[1469]</a></span>
Trimbucjee, had procured the murder of the agent of the Guicowar,
who, in union with the English, was negotiating for a new lease of the
Peishwa's property in Gujerat. The murderer was screened, and signs
were everywhere visible that the Peishwa was meditating treachery.
Yielding to the pressure of the English resident, he surrendered
Trimbucjee; but on the escape of his favourite he again gave him
refuge, and eluded the English demands. At length, yielding to
the strong measures taken by them, he apparently gave up the point,
and in June 1817 entered into a new treaty considerably more
stringent than the Treaty of Bassein, and designed to destroy the
Peishwa's nominal superiority over the Mahratta confederation,
which was the source of so much danger. The effect of the treaty
was very temporary. The Peishwa continued his measures against
the English, attacked and burnt the British residency, was defeated
after a severe battle and fled, intending to make common cause with
his compatriots. Meanwhile events of a somewhat similar character
had been taking place at the courts of the other Mahratta chiefs. It
was thought necessary not only to separate them from the Pindaries,
but to oblige them to join in the suppression of those freebooters.
In November Sindia was compelled to make a treaty to that effect,
containing a most important clause, as it allowed the English to make
separate treaties, which had hitherto been forbidden, with those
chiefs, especially the Rajputs, who were dependent upon Sindia.
The unity of his kingdom was thus broken up. A treaty of a similar
character was concluded with Ameer Khan, the head of a large
body of freebooters in close connection with Holkar, though at the
time resident at Jeypoor. With the other two great chiefs, the Rajah
of Nagpoor and Holkar, more violent measures were found necessary.
Appa Sahib, the uncle of the late prince, had obtained the government
of Nagpoor, and had pretended a close friendship with England.
But the same national aspirations as had moved the Peishwa
acted upon him too. As the Peishwa was the nominal viceroy of the
Mahrattas, so was he their nominal commander-in-chief. He repeated
the treachery at Poonah, and attacked the British residency; and as
his army was strong, and consisted largely of Arabs, he was only defeated
after a battle of eighteen hours' duration. By December, however,
he was thoroughly conquered, and had given himself up to the
English; Nagpoor had been evacuated, and the Arabs dismissed.
Just about the same time the forces of Holkar had been also defeated
at Mahidpoor, in the neighbourhood of Oojein. On the insanity of
Holkar himself, his power had passed into the hands of his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1470" id="Page_1470">[1470]</a></span>
wife, Toolsee-Bhye, as regent for the young prince; but she was
mistrusted by the war party, seized, and put to death. The chiefs then
plunged into war, but were thoroughly defeated by Hislop's forces,
and the young Holkar was compelled to enter into a treaty, which,
among other things, bound him to perpetual peace, and established
the Company as the arbitrator in all his quarrels. As in the case of
Sindia, the Rajput princes subject to his dominion were allowed to
contract separate treaties with the English, and gladly seized the
opportunity. Thus the great confederation was defeated in detail, and
the Peishwa alone, a fugitive from his capital, was capable of making
resistance. It was found nearly impossible to come up with him; though
combats were occasionally fought, no general battle resulted. But a
new plan was devised which before long completed his destruction. The
strongholds of his country were one by one reduced; and among others,
in February, Satara, the residence of the descendants of Sevaji, whose
nominal minister the Peishwa was. The authority of this prince was
re-established, and the Peishwa was deposed, and thus the national
character of his resistance destroyed. Soon after, also (Feb. 19,
1818), he was forced to battle at Ashtee, near Bunderpoor, and there
thoroughly beaten. His power of resistance was now at an end, his
fortresses had fallen one by one; his motley army, consisting largely
of Pindaries, was broken up, and in June, finding himself surrounded,
he surrendered to Sir John Malcolm. He accepted an allowance of £80,000
a year, with leave to withdraw and reside at Benares, where he remained
quietly during the rest of his life. He had refused even to the last to
surrender Trimbucjee, who was, however, shortly afterwards captured,
and kept a prisoner till his death. The destruction of the Mahratta
power had gone hand in hand with that of the Pindaries. Wherever they
had been met with they had been beaten. By the end of February all
their leaders had surrendered, and such remnants of them as were left
had been removed to Goruckpoor, where they settled quietly down. There
was one exception; their great chief, Chetoo, was still at large, and
when Appa Sahib of Nagpoor, continuing his treachery after the treaty,
and still holding communication with the Peishwa, was dethroned,
the two chiefs took refuge in the Mahadeo hills on the south of the
Nerbudda, and there assembled a mixed army of Mahrattas, Arabs, and
Pindaries, to the number of about 20,000. The destruction of these
troops closed the war. The English forces were concentrated for a great
attack; seeing the hopelessness of resistance, the leaders fled, and
took refuge in the fort of Aseerghur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1471" id="Page_1471">[1471]</a></span>
which belonged to Sindia, with whom no doubt Appa had still relations.
The fortress could not long shelter him. Sindia, in fear, refused to
receive him; he fled to Runjeet Singh, and was finally allowed to
return and live peaceably in Judpore. Chetoo, deprived of most of his
followers, also took flight; he attempted to retire into the Malwa,
but during his retreat sought refuge in a thicket, and was there
devoured by a tiger. As a punishment for having received the fugitives,
Aseerghur was besieged and taken, and as clear proofs were found in
it of Sindia's treachery, it was retained. This was the last act of
the war. At its conclusion the whole dominions of the Peishwa, with
the exception of a district given to the Rajah of Satara, and all Appa
Sahib's dominions in Berar, passed directly into the hands of the
English. All the Rajput rajahs had placed themselves under British
protection, and Sindia was the only prince with whom there had not been
concluded a satisfactory subsidiary treaty. Lord Hastings had thus
the merit of thoroughly completing the great plans of the Marquis of
Wellesley.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_LORD_AMHERST" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYTHREE_LORD_AMHERST"></a>Lord Amherst. 1823&mdash;1828.</div>

<p>When Hastings left his office, which he had held for nine years,
he was succeeded by Lord Amherst, who reached Calcutta in August
1823, and held the Governor-generalship till 1828. During that period
the dominions of England received a still further accession, and the
difficulty of putting a stop to a course of conquest once begun was
shown. At the same time that Clive had laid the foundation of the
English Empire, a man of the name of Alompra had established a great
empire on the other side of the Ganges. He had succeeded in bringing
into one the kingdoms of Siam, Pegu, Ava, and Aracan. By degrees
the two empires of Burmah and of India had become conterminous. The
Burmese had been rendered so confident by their successes that they
had demanded of Lord Hastings the surrender of Chittagong, Dacca, and
other places, as having been originally dependencies of Aracan; their
demand had of course been absolutely disregarded, but they were now
proceeding to conquer Cashar, a district in North-Eastern Bengal,
the rajah of which applied for help to the English. A further act of
encroachment on their part brought on a war; they seized, on the coast
of Chittagong, a little island in the possession of a small British
outpost. No satisfaction could be obtained, and in March 1824 war
became inevitable, much against the will, and somewhat to the surprise, of
<span class="sidenote">The Burmese War.</span> Lord Amherst, who had
intended to be peaceful. The attack of the English was made upon
Rangoon at the mouth of the Irawaddi. It was easily occupied, but the
Burmese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1472" id="Page_1472">[1472]</a></span>
were a warlike race, and being strengthened in their wish for
resistance by successes on the Bengal frontier refused to come to
terms. Again and again the great pagoda of Rangoon, which had become
the English citadel, was assaulted. In December a final unsuccessful
attack was made under the command of Maha Bundoola, who had
distinguished himself in the north. From May to February the fighting
about Rangoon had continued, the chief difficulty met with being the
skill of the enemy in the defence of stockades. Then, at last, Sir
Archibald Campbell found it possible to advance up the Irawaddi towards
Prome. In April he reached that place and found it deserted. There
the English remained during the rainy season. In November hostilities
were renewed, and the English gradually forced their way up to within
forty-five miles of Ava, the capital. There at length, in February
1826, a treaty was concluded by which the Burmese ceded Assam, Aracan,
and the country south of Martiban along the coast. They also gave up
their claims upon the English provinces, paid a large sum of money, and
established friendly relations between the courts, to be kept up by an
interchange of ambassadors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_CAPTURE_OF_BHURTPORE" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTYSIX_CAPTURE_OF_BHURTPORE"></a>Capture of Bhurtpore.</div>

<p>The occupation of England in a foreign war had given rise to hopes
among the princes of India that an opportunity had come for reasserting
their freedom. But all such thoughts were dashed to the ground by
the capture and destruction of the fortress of Bhurtpore, hitherto
considered impregnable. At the beginning of 1825 a disputed succession
had occurred. The expelled Prince was under British protection; it
remained to be seen how far it now availed him. Lord Amherst was at
first inclined to non-intervention, but the army was in the hands of
Lord Combermere, an old Peninsula officer, not likely to shrink before
difficulties. He at once undertook to reduce the stronghold. Having
demanded the dismissal of women and children, which was refused, he
proceeded to bombard the town. After two months of siege, the assault
was given, and in two hours the town was secured; the fortress was then
razed to the ground, and the rightful prince reinstated, and the great
movement against the English which had been dreaded by many thinking
men in India thus at once checked. The Indian Empire had now reached
the limits which were not increased for many years. The subsequent
conquests of the Punjaub and Sinde have set a natural and geographical
boundary to it, which, it may be hoped, will prevent the necessity of
those wars of conquest, which were really wars of defence, to which it
owes its present gigantic dimensions.</p>
